The kit also has all the basics: a cloth to wipe the screen down before application, a card to press out bubbles, and, of course, the screen protector itself.Where this 3M screen protector earns points is in its application. It's simple, easy, and (amazingly) there were no bubbles. I always have trouble applying these screen protectors without getting lots of those annoying little bubbles, but somehow I didn't have that problem here.

It's almost invisible during the day and it feels right to the touch but the slightest mistake can get you into trouble from little bubbles to misalignment and you will have to live with your mistakes because ONE protector is all you get so there's no second chance. Unless you can afford to buy more than one.I would recommend this if 'price' is not an issue and if you are good with your hands.

I've done the screen-protector-installation dance before, and from a difficulty perspective, it's about a 6 out of 10 difficulty rating.  You definitely want to take your time installing it because if you mess up the one you get, you're going to have to buy another.Once installed, the protector looks good.  It's nice and glossy with very little distortion of the screen - you can hardly tell it's there.  The downside is that it gets marked up pretty easily.

B009A51Y10,A3T4OHEAHOJ700,B. Colonna,"[0, 0]","I have found that most screen protectors are about the same, with two exceptions, The Belkin Tru Clear and these, 3M's Natural View.  Most screen protectors are also cheaper than these two products.  The Belkin are a little more reasonable, as they come in a 3 pack for about $15, whereas this protector is one to a pack, so they cost about $12 each.I have found that sometimes you end up ruining one or more of the cheaper brands trying to apply them to a phone, and even with the Belkin, on occasion I've used two trying to get one on properly.  I've had some which came up after a few days and had to be replaced. I will say that the 3M Natural View went on easily and perfectly the first time, and seems to be on solid.So, while these are expensive compared to most, if you factor in time, and the occasional protector, wasted, they aren't necessarily that much more than some other brands.The box includes one protector and a cleaning cloth, both sealed in separate plastic packages.The process is the same as with just about any screen overlay.  Clean and dry the screen, make sure it is void of fingerprints, smudges etc. Line up the protector and viola!In the case of this protector, I found it slightly thicker than others, yet completely transparent and it laid flat against the phone without any real edge to collect dirt.  The phone was fully functional and the display perfect after application.Best of all, I had to do minimal smoothing to remove bubbles, whereas with other protectors this sometimes became a chore.I would suggest this screen protector for someone who doesn't mind spending a little more for a very high quality product.The price keeps it from being a '5'.",4.0,1359158400,"01 26, 2013",3M Natural View Screen Protector for the iPhone 5/5s/5c- Retail 1-Pack- Clear (NV827748),10.29,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41xRQmZuWML._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 47435},3M,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Screen Protectors']]",1.0

Privacy ones create odd visual effects if you change the angle of the phone or WANT someone to look at it from the side while you demonstrate something.

Luckily it's not enough to cause any kind of issue, but we can tell that if you touch a bit more than she did, or if you touch a more important part of the adhesive, it could cause issues.

A few years ago, I dropped my iPhone 3GS from about three feet, screen-down, directly onto a pointed rock. The screen protector (one of the flexible armor types) kept the screen from damage, so I vote ""yes.""PERFORMANCE:Very clear, nearly invisible while the phone is in use. My finger does detect an increase in friction when dragging across the screen, but no difference when tapping.APPEARANCE:During the day, this product is so clear that you do not notice it visually. However, in the dark in reflected light it is easy to see a distinct difference between the darker surface of the protector and the lighter surface of the glass around it.APPLICATION:The instructions are clear. I followed them exactly, and they worked. Peel back the first two inches, align carefully, then push forward with the applicator. It went down remarkably bubble-free. But make sure your alignment is absolutely perfect...DURABILITY:...because if one edge of this protector catches on a fingernail something, it will peel up and collect dust or finger prints, effectively ruining it. This shouldn't happen if your alignment is PERFECT, but you know how that goes. Screen protectors don't last forever, but this one peeled off rather too easily for my taste.PACKAGING:On the top front, the package says, ""1 Protector"" in small, lower-case text. At the bottom, it says' ""CONT: 3 ITEMS"" in upper-case text almost twice as tall. The 3 items are: one protector, one cleaning cloth, and one stiff cardboard applicator, which doubles as the hanging tag for the package itself. I'm sorry, but the three items claim borders on deceptive packaging, especially when a count like that is so uncommon on a package. On the back of the package, a small illustration shows 1 protector plus 1 cloth plus 1 applicator, but it does not repeat the language, ""3 ARTICLES."" Perhaps a committee may have been trying to make sure that you noticed that the applicator was also the hanging tag, but adding a claim for ""3 ARTICLES"" to the front of the package wasn't the way to do that. They should have put the illustration on the front and eliminated the ""3 ARTICLES"" claim. 3M does not usually make mistakes like this.RECOMMENDATION:So far, it's functional as a screen protector.

B009A51Y10,A2V5M5EJPOD2IU,David Bradshaw,"[0, 0]","I usually use Belkin screen protectors, but I thought I would give these a go.  First off, a pet peave I have noticed many screen protectors going to is only giving you one!  That is a lot of pressure to get it on there correctly (what happened, I used to get like 3 to 5 for my old iPhones...).  My second thing, is I never get the antiglare or privacy, since they wind up causing these noticeable dots on the screen (very prominent with white screen).  These take a way from the beauty of these displays, so I keep to Clear like these!!  These may not be antiglare, but the loss of sharpness on the display is not worth the basic antiglare.  So these are clear and it is very clear!  I like that it has the Home Button cut out (some lately just have it opened to the base of phone), but it does not have the cutout for the front camera.  Most protectors I have, have cut out the front camera, I find that it make it easier to clean and avoids any issue of specs when that is cut out, so this would be better if it cut out the front camera.  I also want to note that this protector only has a cover on the adhesive side of the protector and not on the front side, so be careful.The protector is like all protectors they are a pain to install with no bubbles or lint (and the lint often caused the bubbles).  No matter how much you clean it will always come up with an issue.  A neat simple trick that the screen protector for my Galaxy Note had was to lift the screen protector back up if you have lint causing a bubble, and put scotch tape on your finger and grab it quickly to the tape and put the protector back until it is on firmly.  This has worked for me and I have gotten the protectors on perfect using this trick.In the end this is a nice basic clear screen protector.  It goes on like all screen protectors and takes some work to get that perfect screen!

The first time I bought one I was surprised(appaslled even) at the cost of a small piece of plastic, but having been through a dozen or more, have to say that some are better than others. The 3m protectors are thick and durable (which also makes them easier to apply).  They do not seem to smudge or collect fingerprints as badly as some that I have,and are well machined so they fit.It's alittle thing which can make a big difference in terms of the longevity of your device, so, I guess my initial frustration was a bit exaggerated.  Put in  context, it costs a lot less than replacing a damaged screen,and/ or can spare you the frustrartion of living with one until you replace the device. (note, few warranties cover routine wear and tear).My electronics are pretty central at this point and I take good care of my equipment (given how much I depend on it on a day to day basis).  That means a good case, and a screen protector. I initially assumed they were more or less the same, but having used quite a few, can now say that is not the case.Screen protectors which are sticky are difficult to apply and can cause the very problems you are trying to prevent if you trap something that can damage the screen. Some get so smudged or dirty that the screen is difficult to see, and others make the touch screen less sensitive.  The 3m screen protectors are very good all around, avoiding these problems and providing a good protective coating.  My personal preference for devices I will use outdoors is for a protector with anti-glare as well(like those linked above) but if that is not an issue for you, these are as good or better than other brands I have tried , and I intend to replace the problematic one on my tablet if 3m makes one in the correct size.",5.0,1360022400,"02 5, 2013",3M Natural View Screen Protector for the iPhone 5/5s/5c- Retail 1-Pack- Clear (NV827748),10.29,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41xRQmZuWML._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 47435},3M,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Screen Protectors']]",1.0

Even thought the glass is scratch proof, it makes me feel a little more at ease knowing that I have an extra layer of protection on my phone.  3M's Natural View screen protector is not a hard screen protector - it's actually a paper thin plastic layer than I could compare to the plastic layer that is on every new iPhone.  While it won't protect my phone from a high drop, it will keep the screen from getting scratched or scuffed, and should I drop my phone and the should shatter, the layer would keep all the pieces intact on my phone.It's very easy to install - simply clean your screen, lay on about 2 cm of the plastic on the phone, then use the included cardboard tool (or a credit card/business card) to smooth the remaining coating over the phone screen.  I did not have any problems with bubbling or marks on my phone.  There is an opening at both the top and bottom of the screen protector to allow access to the home button and the speaker at the top of the phone.  The camera is covered by the protector - some people may not like this, but I have no problem with that camera being covered as I don't utilize it often.  The quality of the picture does not seem to be affected either way.One gripe I have with this package is that there is only one protector in the package.

The Natural View screen protector wipes clean easily and does protect your screen from scratches, rubs, etc. I feel comfortable with it in my pocket, brief case, etc. This is a pretty durable product and I think the only way you might have to replace it is if something sharp scratches it or if you accidently peel it off and can't get back on without a ton of bubbles (the first time is usually the best, but be careful and go slowly).

Some of them make the phone's screen seem to stop responding correctly, or they feel filmy or streaky.This one didn't seem to affect the function of my phone, though it did feel a little streaky (not a lot; just a bit). The big issue I had with this, though, is that the center of it seemed to ""rub off"" a little bit...kind of like it was coated with some protective stuff on the front that rubbed off after light usage. To be fair, it didn't feel like it had anything on it, and when the phone was turned on, you couldn't see a problem at all. But when the phone was off, you could see a bit spot in the center of it that looked like it had rubbed off. Weird.Aside from that, it just didn't feel right to me. Like most screen protectors, I just didn't like the way it felt, although less so than with other similar items. Still, it certainly wasn't enough to keep it on there. Your mileage may vary, but it just wasn't for me. I've now moved on to the ""anti-glare"" one, and I like that much better. I'll do a separate review for that, but that one actually has a chance of staying on my phone for a while...the first screen protector I've ever said that about.",3.0,1360108800,"02 6, 2013",3M Natural View Screen Protector for the iPhone 5/5s/5c- Retail 1-Pack- Clear (NV827748),10.29,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41xRQmZuWML._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 47435},3M,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Screen Protectors']]",1.0

Only one protector is in the package and it is a screen protector, reduces glare and is scratch resistant. This product is a high quality protector, with careful packaging. Videos are available online to view the application process. I have done a number of these so I did not bother with checking them. I always read the directions first. The product has two flaps with color photos and instructions which help greatly. The one protector is neatly packaged and had a longer covering that makes removing the protector much easier. Many have a protector covering that is the same size of the protector that makes it hard to see which is which. This is a great help. There is a nice, large 3M cloth used to clean your phone screen and the protector after it is applied. This is another feature that 3M offers extra. The size of most protector cloths (if included) are short and small and hard to use. This nice large size makes it easy to use. One unusual thing 3M has done regards the applicator (used to smooth the bubbles out). Most protector packages give you a plastic one, generally short. 3M includes a stiff cardboard applicator that is part of the package (open carefully!) with a blue stripe to differentiate it. Believe it or not, this still cardboard actually works better than the plastic cards for smoothing bubbles. I was able to clean my screen and apply the protector on the first try. The cutouts for the front buttons are one larger button that makes it easier to place the top section. I had a previous one on my old 4 that separated the buttons with a thin strip in between that made it much harder to place.

The start at bottom going to top slowly, every so slowly laying down the protector on the glass screen while sliding a credit card on the just laid down protector so you keep eliminating any air pockets. Slow and steady is a job well done. Then peel away the top to reveal the perfect shiny new screen with no air bubbles and protector barely visible except at the edges.However, the thinner and cheaper no-name protectors are no good and no matter how well you lay them down they bubble up or get a weird orange peel effect due to cheap adhesive layer. The 3M protector eliminates that as well as some of the glare so you can see your phone screen in brighter light. The tactile feeling is pretty good, and I'd rather take a tiny bit of loss in the tactile feeling to keep it scratch and shatter free. It also keeps off messy fingerprints.

B009A51Y1U,A3JUHP1E3WUHEA,Dr. Stuart Gitlow,"[0, 0]","The term ""Screen Protector"" makes you think of a thick piece of plastic that would stop the screen from shattering when you drop a rock on it. Screen protectors are actually a very thin plastic sheet which adhere to the screen. They protect the screen from light scratches if you, say, put the phone in your pocket with keys or loose change. They protect it from oil should you answer the phone after putting lotion or oil on your hands. In the process, though, they sometimes trap dust between the screen and the plastic, causing air bubbles to interfere with the appearance of the image on the screen. And sometimes they interfere with the overall image quality.In this case, 3M provides a screen cleaning microfiber cloth to use initially as well as a small piece of cardboard to be used as an applicator. Used properly, you can get the sheet on the phone without air bubbles. For this screen to be anti-glare, there's a flat coating on the sheet that degrades image quality slightly. It's not a big deal, but it's noticeable, so it becomes a glare vs image quality question. If you primarily use your phone in sunlight or under overhead lighting at work, this is a perfect solution. But if glare never bothers you, get the non-glare screen protector instead.As you apply the sheet, do so in as dust-free an area as possible. The last thing you want is for static to attract dust to the protector as you apply it.

The second was horrible--it was the kind that makes the screen impossible to read from the sides to protect privacy (I nearly went blind with how grainy it made things look). This screen protector has the best overall score:Clarity: 3 starsThere is a bit of fuzziness added to the screen, sort of like a haze, that takes away from the retina display. It is not so bad that reading text is impaired, so it's not a logistical problem so much as an aesthetic one.Texture: 5 starsSome slick screen protectors almost feel sticky and can sort of catch on your fingers as you slide them across the screen. This one has a feel similar to the kindle display--almost papery, very smooth--no catching or sticking.Glare: 5 starsIt really does reduce glare! Great if you plan on using your phone outdoors.Application Process: 4 starsThis screen protector is a little thicker than the cheap ones, which makes it easier to install. The cleansing cloth helps get rid of some static, but for some reason, there's always a bit of a charge to the phone and to the SP. Some dust always manages to get in. Also, most kits come with a plastic or hard cardboard thing to push bubbles out. It's not a big deal--I just used a credit card, but I thought it would come with that. It went fine, though.

B009A51Y1U,A1ILWPH1GHUXE2,JB,"[0, 0]","First off, I tried to be as careful as possible when applying this 3M Anti-Glare Screen Protector, but even then I was not able to prevent a few small bubbles from appearing in the middle of the iPhone.  Fortunately these tiny bubbles are not visible unless the phone background is black (typically only when it is turned off).However, I don't like the way the anti-glare protector makes the screen slightly fuzzy, especially noticeable with white.  Similar to computer screens, there is a tradeoff between the clearness / sharpness of the screen and it's susceptibility to glare - any film / coating / treatment meant to reduce glare is also going to reduce the sharpness of the display a bit.  Since I've had no issues with glare on my iPhone 5 up to now, this screen doesn't really fix anything for me and reduces the quality of the iPhone 5 Retina display.I also want to agree with other reviewers that 3M should have included at least two protectors in the package, if for no other reason than it is so easy to mess up the application and having a second protectors as a backup would be nice.  It seems liek the price charged for the single protector provided is *very* high.Now if glare is a real problem with your iPhone, this may work out for you.  But if you're looking just for protection without an anti-glare treatment, perhaps the3M Natural View NV827748 Screen Protector for iPhone 5 - Clearmay be a better choice.Edit - since I first wrote this I tried out the3M Natural View NV827748 Screen Protector for iPhone 5.

It's good for glare and goes on without too much fussing.The good parts:- the plastic is just the right amount of stiffness to apply easily and not give me a nightmare of bubbles to deal with. The really limp screens by other companies have bubbles galore, and are hard to line up on the iphone screens. This one is relatively easy to apply.- the screen is easy to take off when needed and put back on, due to the relative thickness.- the screen stays mostly free of fingerprints, unlike with some other protectors.- a little 3M wiping cloth and a paperboard smoothing applicator is included.- significantly cuts out glare in bright sunlight. This is the point of the product, so full marks on that.- the touch screen on the phone works very well with the protector applied- the plastic protects the glass on my phone.Less good:- the matte surface really cuts down the pristine screen resolution of the iPhone. If you know this going in, that's fine. This screen is great if you spend a lot of time outdoors, or are sensitive to glare.- only one side of the screen came with a protective layer of plastic, so my screen protector actually arrived ""pre-scratched"".

B009A51Y1U,ABQWMANK4AR63,"John S. Dean ""John""","[0, 0]","I've been using smart phones since their inception, and I have NEVER liked screen protectors.  Nor have I ever liked them on my tablets, whether Windows based Tablet PC's or other things like my iPads or Kindles.  They generally serve no purpose for me, since I don't have a habit of getting scratches on devices.  Fingerprints are easy to wipe off with a microfiber cloth, and more often than not even if there are no bubbles under the film when you apply it, it seems there ends up being some at some point anyway.  So for a couple decades now, going back to even just the first old PDA's, I've avoided them.I saw this one in the Vine program and decided to give it a try more for the anti-glare properties than anything else.  I figured worst case scenario I'd pull it off.When I installed it, I had the typical frustration of some bubbles, no matter how carefully I was applying it and using a straight edge to help keep it on there.  So far, just like any other protector.  But with some judicious wrangling, I was able to get it on with only a couple bubbles out to the edges of the screen, none in the middle.  And even just using a fingernail, I was able to push them out.  And unlike most other protectors, they didn't reappear.The material is a bit thicker and stiffer than most I've used, and has a slightly rough feel to it, very different from the feel of the smooth glass.  On my Macbook Pro computer, I LOVE the glass trackpad, and even though I use palm protectors on them, I never put a protector on the trackpad, as the feel and smoothness of it is one of the things that first drew me away from PC's.  But despite that, I find I now prefer this feel on my iPhone for some reason.  It just feels better to me.  I don't use gestures on the iPhone like I do on the laptop, so the slightly rougher surface isn't a hinderance at all.The anti glare works pretty well, but it's not a total solution for glare since in some situations you just end up with a duller flat white spot rather than a glaring reflection, but that's pretty much when you position yourself using it as a mirror to an extremely bright light source, which isn't something people generally do when they're using these anyway.  So for the most part, it does help improve visibility of the device, without any notable detraction in lower light situations.  It also preserves a great wide angle viewability although you can notice some dimming at extreme angles.I use it with a case and it didn't cause any issues with getting the case on or off.  The cut is about as perfect as I've ever seen, it fits exactly as it needs to, with the cutout for the home button and one for the top by the microphone and camera (and a cut to one side, for the ambient light sensor I assume).The only downside I've seen is bits of dust or pocket lint likes to gather around the edge of the protector by the home button, nothing that a brush of a finger or blowing at it won't dislodge.All in all I'm pretty impressed with it, compared to my history with this kind of product.  I'm actually keeping it on the phone, something I hadn't really anticipated I'd end up doing.Edit December 2013 - after 6 months or so this started getting pretty awful looking around the edges.  And it's not even the edges where you'd think maybe something caught it and started to separate, but around the ear piece speaker as well.  Just dust and such that got under there and gummed up the exterior edge about a quarter inch from all the edges.  Oddly enough the bottom half of the unit was totally unaffected by this, just the top half and around the cutout for the ear speaker.  I ended up pulling it off and have my phone going commando again as far as screen protectors go.",4.0,1361404800,"02 21, 2013",3M Natural View Anti-Glare Screen Protector for the iPhone 5/5s/5c- Retail 1-Pack- Clear (NVAG828762),13.08,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41efBH1cb3L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 94487},3M,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Screen Protectors']]",1.0

This is not as bad as others I have tried, but it is still present, and I don't think there is any way to get around it. You will be giving up a little bit of image quality. If you don't mind that, then you'll love this. I'm not so happy about it, as I love the image quality I normally have, and so does my wife (I actually put it on hers). I got lucky on this one and got one very tiny bubble on the corner....I count that as a success. The protector fits well, covers well, and protects the screen from light scratches, especially from keys that might be floating around in her bag. If she had kept it on, I don't know how long it would have lasted, after one week, it was pretty scuffed (but in all fairness, she has a lot in her bag)....She said it almost feels like there is a filter over the screen. I understand what she means, it is subtle, but you can tell a difference without it. Still, as far as anti-glare goes, this is probably the best I have seen, so if glare is an issue for you, this is the one to get. If not, I would pass and get a protector that is truly clear.

I started with the standard one, and really didn't care for it much. Then, I moved on to this one, and I actually very much like it.First, I guess I should say that I generally don't care for screen protectors at all, as 1. they rarely go on without getting tiny pieces of lint/dust under them, no matter how careful you are, and 2. they don't feel right. Some of them make the phone's screen seem to stop responding correctly, or they feel filmy or streaky. The standard 3M one felt a little streaky and seemed to have something on it that rubbed off after just a few hours of usage. Not horrible, but I didn't like it near enough to keep it on my phone.So then I moved on to this anti-glare one, and I like it much better. As they mention in the description, it has a silky, kind of satin feel to it. When you look at it, it almost looks cloudy, though it doesn't look that way when you turn the phone on. It doesn't negatively affect the screen at all. And, despite my expectations, it actually feels very nice to use. They call it a ""smooth touch"", and it does feel smooth. It doesn't affect the screen's performance at all that I can notice, and it actually does cut down on glare. I've never noticed any particular glare on this (or any other) iPhone in the first place, but I must say that I notice a bit LESS of it with this protector on (if that makes sense). That is, once I got this on my phone, I noticed that I can turn it any direction and I don't see a glare with it...hadn't realized that I had made those tiny, subconscious adjustments previously, until I had this screen protector on and didn't have to make them.Your mileage may vary, but this screen protector actually has a chance of staying on my phone for a while...the first screen protector I've ever said that about.",5.0,1360108800,"02 6, 2013",3M Natural View Anti-Glare Screen Protector for the iPhone 5/5s/5c- Retail 1-Pack- Clear (NVAG828762),13.08,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41efBH1cb3L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 94487},3M,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Screen Protectors']]",-1.0

I worked at the Apple Retail Store for nearly 5 years and I have probably put these types of films on at least 100 phones over the years... and I'd say these are really good films and do the job if properly applied. Let me share some tips to make this a great fit for your phone. It is crucial that dogs, cats, or any pet that bears fur or feathers be in another room and that children are not running around during the installation of the film. If you have any fans (oscillating, ceiling, etc.), make sure they are off and have stopped turning completely. Turn off the heat and/or air conditioning. Seriously - it's just for a few minutes - you need to have ZERO air movement. The air we breath is FULL of tiny, barely perceptible amounts of dust and lint hanging in near suspension in the air. As long as you stop the circulation of air, these particles begin to settle a bit. The little fibers and debris you can barely see in the air are magnified 50x the minute they get under the film. Once all air movement has settled down, it's time to prepare the phone. It should be removed from the case and cleaned thoroughly by applying an appropriate electronics cleaning fluid like iClean to a microfiber cloth. Never spray fluid onto your phone! Apply the fluid on the cloth and vigorously wipe and clean it, and examine under a bright light to make sure there are no fibers there. When you are ready to apply the film, be sure no part of your finger even grazes the edge of it - or your finger grease will be there - just enough to make the film peel back after time. Use the non-sticky backing of the film to help you line up the edges.  Apply at one edge and very slowly peel it down toward the glass to avoid air bubbles. If a bubble is visible, pull back a bit and try again. Patience is key. Also - limit your breathing to slow, measured breaths - you can exhale debris right onto the sticky surface or onto your iPhone glass. Even though the films are cut precisely for an iPhone 5, you cannot just try aligning it using the corner. During the whole process, you should be watching the hole for the home button and the ear speaker to make sure everything is lining up and that it is not askew. Once applied properly, the film is secure. Your finger won't slide quite as smoothly as it does across bare glass, but it won't leave discernable fingerprints unless you were just eating fried chicken. It takes away the glare and the annoyance of greasy finger prints occluding the view of the icons, your photos, etc. Nice product.",5.0,1358467200,"01 18, 2013",3M Natural View Anti-Glare Screen Protector for the iPhone 5/5s/5c- Retail 1-Pack- Clear (NVAG828762),13.08,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41efBH1cb3L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 94487},3M,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Screen Protectors']]",1.0

I see a privacy screen almost as a 'must' for anyone who rides trains or subways on a regular bases.The not so good aspects of this particular model, other than the somewhat high price are 'durability', a slightly blurred image and the screen becoming somewhat less responsive to touch but maybe the latter is my subjective impression.

I really like the idea of privacy from those around me, especially in meetings, while viewing my iPhone 5. I've been using this screen protector for a couple of weeks and here's what I've found:Pros:* This privacy screen protector does what it says:- Ensures privacy from those sitting to the side of you. I have been in several meetings and have had people ask me what I have on my phone's screen because they couldn't see my screen sitting next me.- Reduces glare but when in full on sun the screen is still hard to view.* It will protect the display from minor scratches.* This was one of the easiest screen protectors I have ever applied to a screen. This is because the screen protector is thicker and more rigid then the typical screen protector.Cons:* The screen protector gives the new iPhone 5's retina display a slightly pixelated look. The pixelation is noticeable when I very first applied it but after a couple of weeks of use I don't notice the pixelation anymore.Neutral:* The screen protector will darken your display so you will need to adjust the brightness on your iPhone.My husband likes the way this screen protector looks on my iPhone so we ordered him one for his iPhone too.If you are wanting a screen protector that will give you privacy, this is the one to get, however if the beautiful retina display is major factor for you then pass on this screen protector because you will be disappointed with slightly pixelated screen.",4.0,1355788800,"12 18, 2012",3M Privacy Screen Protector for the iPhone 5/5s/5c- Retail 1-Pack- Clear/Black (MPF828786),15.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-L3Xp6PiL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8499},3M,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Screen Protectors']]",1.0
B009A5206S,A3JUHP1E3WUHEA,Dr. Stuart Gitlow,"[0, 0]","The 3M Privacy Screen Protector is a thin polarized film that adheres to the front screen of your iPhone 5. The application process is straight-forward: first, clean your screen well using the included cloth. Then pull back on the backing while simultaneously using the included applicator to smooth out the film as you go. This is easier than it sounds once you get the orientation just right so the film goes on straight. I managed to do this without getting any bubbles or dirt specks thanks to the applicator.Once applied, you'll quickly see that your image clarity is impacted. There is a loss of both brightness and resolution with the greatest noticeable impact being on pictures. If you use your iPhone extensively for photos or video, you shouldn't get this protector. On the other hand, if you frequently view financial information or other private material in public, that's where you get value from this particular screen protector.Note that the protection is oriented in one direction: if the phone is held vertically, the person sitting next to you on the bus or airplane will not be able to see what you're doing. On the other hand, if you turn the phone horizontally, the person next to you will be able to see what's on the phone, albeit with reduced clarity. Similarly, if you have the phone vertically, the person standing over you on the bus while you're seated will be able to see your phone's screen. So the bottom line here, as with any polarized screen, is to be aware of the shape of your privacy oval. This is a significant improvement from a privacy perspective, but it doesn't lock out everyone who isn't directly in front of the phone.Note that the screen is somewhat thicker than your average protective screen film, so this will do a good job protecting your screen from keys, coins, or other metal objects that might be floating around in your pockets with the phone.

The plastic screen protector is actually rigid - installation is very easy.  Simply clean your screen, lay on about 2 cm of the plastic on the phone, then use the included cardboard tool (or a credit card/business card) to smooth the remaining coating over the phone screen. I did not have any problems with bubbling or marks on my phone. There is an opening at both the top and bottom of the screen protector to allow access to the home button and the camera/speaker at the top of the phone.  This allows for almost full coverage of your phone screen.  When turned at a slight angle, the screen starts darkening out.  This means that nosy people on your sides will not be able to peek at your screen.  People directly behind you will be able to still look at your screen - but hopefully you don't have someone constantly looking over your shoulder.  With a thick layer protecting your screen from scratches, and a darkening effect to keep nosy people from looking at your work, you get two fold protection.  However, this protection comes at a huge cost.Because of the screen is a privacy screen, it's a grey shaded screen.  This makes the image quality and brightness of the iPhone 5 screen go dramatically down.  When viewing the screen, the screen almost seems pixelated.  The retina display is kinda thrown out the window with this protector.  Also, because the screen is darkened, you do have to turn up the brightness of your screen a bit to see it.

It was really easy to put on, but make sure you use the applicator or else you'll get bubbles. Also I can't figure out how to get it back off.The screen isn't very dark when you're looking straight on. You might notice a difference at first, but your eyes will get used to it pretty quick. You can kind of see it if your looking at it from the side (like if you were standing next to someone looking over at the screen), but it is pretty hard to see. Standing behind someone also doesn't seem to block the screen, but when the screen is tilted, that's when it blocks out people from looking in at the screen.With Otterbox: the screen disrupts the vacuum that the otterbox creates between the screen and the otterbox screen. This makes it really hard to type, so I wouldn't use it if you have one of those.Without Otterbox: it is really easy to use if there's no external cover. Super easy to type on, very sensitive just like the normal iPhone.So it's a super handy thing if you want a privacy shield and you don't have a cover with an extra screen.",3.0,1364428800,"03 28, 2013",3M Privacy Screen Protector for the iPhone 5/5s/5c- Retail 1-Pack- Clear/Black (MPF828786),15.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-L3Xp6PiL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8499},3M,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Screen Protectors']]",1.0

I know people don't intentionally aim to read over my shoulder when I'm on my phone, but sometimes they do and it drives me crazy!Essentially all this screen protector does is it polarizes the screen of the phone. Vertical slats allow you see the phone when facing it directly, but darken the screen when observing from an angle to the left or right. It doesn't prevent anyone from seeing something on the phone if they catch the screen at a vertical angle, so if they're standing directly in front of you and you have the phone down low enough that they could see, they'll be able to see what you're doing on the phone.I gave this item a 4/5 because it's not the most aesthetically pleasing screen protector I've ever used. It's very thick (to allow for the polarizing slats) and dark. I have the white iPhone, and because the screen protector is as long as the phone, the region around my home key is now an ugly dark grey hue.

Those required to use these on their computer screens at work will be familiar with the goal: you can see your screen straight on, but those to the side of you can't get a clear view of your work.  This protector offers some privacy against side viewers, but perhaps because the screen is so small it does not completely block your phone's screen from view by others.Like most quality products, it comes at a premium.  It provides good screen protection against scratches and it also lessens glare, fingerprints and smudges.  The trade-off is that it diminishes clarity, even more than the3M Natural View NVAG828762 Anti-Glare Screen Protector for iPhone 5 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Clear.

The protector is thick and definitely would keep your screen protected.  It's probably one of the better protectors on the market, but the real interesting part is the fact that it limits the viewing angles on your phone to basically a straight on view.

B009A5206S,AW7BIYHXUIZ62,T.M. Reader,"[0, 0]","I've consistently found 3M to offer top of the line no compromise products . . . so I'll assume the compromises one makes with use of this privacy/screen protector are unavoidable.  My observations.Installation was easy and produced a nice bubble-free result. A micro-fiber prep cloth is provided.Privacy is afforded, as advertised, from unwanted viewing from each side, when the device is held in a vertical orientation. It does not block viewing from above - for instance from someone looking down from above you from behind, like in an airline seat situation.  Holding your iphone horizontally will allow shared viewing to the side (but not from above).  3M calls this ""micro-louvre"" technology . . . perhaps you can visualize the viewing ""louvres"" running north/south on your screen.The definition of the display is slightly degraded, with an observable graininess.It does indeed provide protection for the screen.An unexpected bonus was glare/shine elimination.  Nice.The touch sensitivity of the screen is likewise degraded.  The experience improves once one adapts to the slightly less sensitive touch (until then, you'll be doing some double-takes).Good product.  Not quite ideal, but it has it's uses and becomes less noticable as the user adapts.",4.0,1360195200,"02 7, 2013",3M Privacy Screen Protector for the iPhone 5/5s/5c- Retail 1-Pack- Clear/Black (MPF828786),15.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-L3Xp6PiL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8499},3M,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Screen Protectors']]",1.0
