More so, when plugged in, the phone starts auto-dialing last dialed numbered.I spent quite a lot of time trying to understand how I can make it work. Searching and reading over the Web taught me that it is no slam dunk. 2.5 and 3.5 connectors can be wired in a number of different ways and support mono, stereo, mic, etc. There are plugs with 1, 2 and 3 rings (respectively with 2, 3 and 4 connectors - the connector is the metal part between the rings).However this is HTC part meant to work with my HTC Mogul Sprint phone - and it doesn't. My conclusion so far is that this adapter came with some short of a defect or a 'short' in its wiring though my empirical tests are not conclusive. For example, I can get mono audio out by plugging in a telephone headset into the 2.5 connection. The weird thing is that if I plug my stereo standard 3.5 headphone into that same connection (using another 2.5 to 3.5 adapter) I do not get audio.After many frustrating hours I came up with one workaround that works - plug an earphone into the proprietary port and check for sound, then plug another one in the 2.5 and test and then plug -slowly- the 3.5 in - this gets me audio out and then I can unplug the other two.I just returned mine and ordered another from the same vendor.

I feel like I get about 25% more life then I did with the stock battery and about the same as the Seido 1750 (which is a lot more money).

Rubber case is a good thickness, enough to protect the phone but not too bulky at the same time.  The case is pretty good about not slipping off when pulling out of pockets (but it does once in a while if it gets snagged).  Case feels smooth, and not at all sticky like some rubber finishes.  All I/O ports on phone are easily accessible (other reviewers who state otherwise purchased a different case), case does not block any ports or openings on the phone.  Overall, very pleased with this case and with the price point.  HTC Incredible owners should put this case on their short list.Update 7/24/10:  After using this case for several months now, I am still happy with the fit of the case (fits snugly around phone still) and it has saved my phone from damage on many occasions already.  The one thing that has been a bit annoying though, is that the rubber gets snagged in many of my khaki pant pockets.  When you hold the case in your hand, it feels smooth, but for some reason when it comes into contact with cloth material, it gets snagged easily.

The earpiece cutout seems to be 1mm or so too high, but does not impair functionality.The USB cutout is large enough to easily accommodate the charging cable without being too large.  However, on mine it looks like someone ripped off some extra silicone that was left when the cover was created, so it looks slightly damaged.  This looks to be mainly cosmetic damage.It seems that on the sides of the case in the middle of the phone is not tight enough to keep a proper grip on the phone.  This makes it look like the phone is bulging out a bit on the sides.

The OEM battery's part number is 35H00123-22M.  The one I received was 35H00123-25M.  The 1500mAh was consistent with the original according to the red sticker, so that was alright (contrary to some other batteries other customers received from various Amazon sellers when ordering this battery).The biggest problem I have is that it was listed as ""NEW"".  This battery is not NEW in any way.  The gold contacts on the battery are worn, so it's obvious this battery was heavily used at some point.  That is straight-up LYING to people and taking their money the whole time knowing they're scamming people.Last night she plugged in her phone before she went to bed using this battery, and this morning the battery didn't charge... at all.  She gave up on it, put the OEM battery back in her phone, and let me know what happened.I would have been irritated enough if it would have been for MY phone, but now it's 10X worse because it looks like I cheaped-out on it after I told her I was getting her a NEW second battery for it.In the end, Beast Deals lied in their description... twice.  Once about it being ""new"", and second about the item number itself.  Looks like it depends on which seller you buy from according to the comments, but Beast Deals lost all credibility as a reputable seller with me (and according to comments, others as well).I'll eat the $6 or whatever I paid for this POS, and use it as a cheap lesson learned.  I will be MUCH more cautious towards future purchases from 3rd party sellers on here.  I never had a problem with ANYTHING I purchased straight from Amazon.com as the fullfiller of my orders, or straight from a legit manufacturers (Dell, BlackBerry, etc) via Amazon.com.

B0047EOBRS,A1G8DM2EDMZTOO,Paul Clifford,"[2, 2]","I purchased two OEM HTC USB Travel Charger Adapter U250 from two different vendors here. One from ""RKA Wireless"", and one from ""Cell Factory Outlet"".  Both are counterfeit knockoffs of the true OEM HTC charger.  Their housing and external markings are very well done -- they deceptively mimic the HTC logo and forge the certification agency marks.  I measured the output of the charger and compared its actual capability against its stated specification and the capability of a genuine HTC charger.  The genuine item provides a reasonably well regulated 5 volts.  It provides 5.06V open circuit, dropping to 4.8 V at 0.6A, and dropping further to 4.53V at 1.13A.  The counterfeits provide a poorly regulated 5.37 V open circuit, decreasing steadily with current to 4.5V at 450 mA.  Attempts to draw more current just result in rapid voltage drop, at 500 mA the voltage is down to 2V.  That's quite a deviation from the 5V 1A marked on the back of the enclosure.  The too great voltage when unloaded is a hazard, and the drop in voltage at moderate current draw will cause unpredictable results when charging most devices.Interestingly, these counterfeits appear to have similar voltage/current capability (hence probably similar internal circuitry) of some other counterfeit chargers sold through Amazon, like the White USB Cable Power Adapter (Wall Charger Adaptor with fixed blades) for Apple iPod, iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPhone 4,Touch, Shuffle, Nano, Classic which I purchased through Amazon from ""A Sonic (Your USA Store)"".Since writing this review I've stumbled across a comprehensive test and comparison of true chargers vs counterfeit chargers, which you may find helpful: [...]",1.0,1346889600,"09 6, 2012",OEM HTC USB Travel Charger Adapter U250 / CNR6300 / 79H00095-14M,4.46,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41MpyZiNxfL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 7858},HTC,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Travel Chargers']]",1.0

B0047EP8IY,A1G8DM2EDMZTOO,Paul Clifford,"[39, 40]","I purchased two OEM HTC USB Travel Charger Adapter U250 from two different vendors here. One from this listing, provided by ""RK Wireless"" (called RKA Wireless on their packing slip), and one from ""Cell Factory Outlet"" (from this page:OEM HTC USB Travel Charger Adapter U250 / CNR6300 / 79H00095-14M). Both are counterfeit knockoffs of the true OEM HTC charger. Their housing and external markings are very well done -- they deceptively mimic the HTC logo and forge the certification agency marks. I measured the output of the charger and compared its actual capability against its stated specification and the capability of a genuine HTC charger. The genuine item provides a reasonably well regulated 5 volts.  It provides 5.06V open circuit, dropping to 4.8 V at 0.6A, and dropping further to 4.53V at 1.13A. The counterfeits provide a poorly regulated 5.37 V open circuit, decreasing steadily with current to 4.5V at 450 mA. Attempts to draw more current result in rapid voltage drop, at 500 mA the voltage is down to 2V. That's quite a deviation from the 5V 1A marked on the back of the enclosure. The too great voltage when unloaded is a hazard to some devices, and the drop in voltage at moderate current draw will cause unpredictable results when charging most cell phones.  These chargers do not charge my HTC phone properly.Interestingly, these counterfeits appear to have similar voltage/current capability (hence probably similar internal circuitry) of some other counterfeit chargers sold through Amazon, like the White USB Cable Power Adapter (Wall Charger Adaptor with fixed blades) for Apple iPod, iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPhone 4,Touch, Shuffle, Nano, Classic which I purchased through Amazon from ""A Sonic (Your USA Store)"".Since writing this review I've stumbled across a comprehensive test and comparison of true chargers vs counterfeit chargers, which you may find helpful: [...]",1.0,1346889600,"09 6, 2012",HTC U250 USB AC Travel Charger Adapter Power Plug for Smartphones - Non-Retail Packaging - Black,2.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417nguFSWnL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 6500},HTC,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Travel Chargers']]",1.0

B004AFVEOC,A18VCM7Y7HK6EW,Chris,"[1, 3]","I had the HTC Incredible for one year, which was several months too long.  Call quality was fair and UI was fair.  The main weakness with Android is that when Google releases a new OS version, it has to go to the vendor so they can tweak and then release it themselves.  This can take FOREVER.  The update to Froyo came fairly quickly, but soon there was talk of Gingerbread, Honeycomb, and even Ice Cream.  Well, HTC FINALLY released Gingerbread, and that was it.  Along the way, I encountered several software bugs, primarily with exchange mail.  I wrote HTC several times and they always came back with these outlandish ""troubleshooting"" processes.  The other thing was that HTC advertised that you could ""make it yours""...FAR from it, guys !!  Just ONE example that aggravated the crap out me was not being able to turn off haptic feedback with the dialer.  HTC said that was designed like that in case it was in your pocket and you could tell if it was dialing accidentally.  SERIOUSLY, even if I did keep it in my pocket, it would be LOCKED !!

B004AFVEOC,A34UVV757IKPVB,justsomeguy,"[0, 16]","Hi. I've had my HTC Incredible for just over a year now.  When it worked, it was pretty cool.  The battery lasted a couple days, the functionality and apps you could download worked pretty well.  But inside of the 1 year mark of owning it, it all went south.First, the battery died.  Over time, it would last less and less until finally it just up and died and wouldn't take a charge. Fine - I bought an extended battery that worked well.Then, the charging jack broke.  That's the little port on the left side of the phone.  Won't take a charge, won't work for copying photos/music to and from the phone. So, along with buying a battery, I bought some (cheap) external battery chargers and some more batteries.  It works OK.  Still can't get more than 24 hours of use from a battery (god forbid you actually USE apps on this thing - they KILL the battery).Next, the power button died.  I can't turn it on and off.  I have to click it a million times to hopefully make it activate the screen.  I certainly can't put it to sleep anymore, and I've accidentally called people because of this.-In summary, it's just not well-designed.  I didn't even mention that I had to re-boot the phone because I could no longer get the ""marketplace"" app to work.  That was a HUGE pain in the butt.-When the iphone 5 comes out, I'm switching.  I'm done with these shoddy impersonations of what is simply the greatest phone out there: the iphone.",2.0,1317168000,"09 28, 2011",HTC DROID INCREDIBLE Android Phone Black (Verizon Wireless),88.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31WdpOIxuxL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2626},HTC,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",-1.0

The phone is upgradable to 7.5 (mango) and will update when connected to zune software.  The music and photo programs as well as the live tiles are vey well designed and easier to use.  And yes it is UNLOCKED and I am using this phone right now in Germany (on a German network).  (American Citizen).The only issues I have see is that the phone was packaged ""new"" but I can tell it was probably refurbished due to some light and VERY minor scratches on the back cover and the APP store/marketplace does not have the same support (as many apps) as Anroid or Iphone, but you can still find what you need.  Battery life is not too terrible, lasts me all day with intermittent usage (heavy at times).Apps that look ugly on Iphone and Android are crisp and clean on WP7.In closing, I recommend this phone and platform over the competition.

B004HWZ5KM,A3MUQ4TCM14XR4,daniel_leavitt2000,"[0, 0]","The HTC Surround was one of the original Windows Phone 7 devices announced in late 2010. I bought one in 2012 to replace a broken Samsung Focus. The Focus lasted 18 months of torture, and the Surround barley made it 4 months.The Surround has two pop-up speakers and a kick stand to watch Netflix, YouTube and listen to music. The problem is that this adds a LOT of bulk to the device. The sliding mechanism is more fragile than a phone without moving parts and this phone does not even benefit from having a real keyboard. Worse still is that you have to slide the speakers out when playing anything or the sound will come out muffled.Now I didn't really mind the sliding speakers as I used the phone for Netflix a lot. The pop-up speakers and kickstand worked fine for watching movies on the go. But the experience was still bad because of the screen. For whatever reason, HTC decided to use some very old tech on the screen. Blacks are washed out and gray. Colors don't pop. The screen was fairly small at 3.7"" and motion wasn't as smooth as on the Samsung Focus. All in all, it's a pretty terrible viewing experience. This is completely inexcusable for any device running Windows Phone that relies so heavily on deep blacks and saturated colors.So how about durability? Yeah, not so much. As I said, this phone lasted 4 months compared to my Previous Samsung Focus under the same conditions (lasting 18 months). When dropped, the screen shattered. This was no Gorilla Glass, and it showed.So how about performance? The Surround uses the same Snapdragon processor of other first generation Windows Phones and many Android phones of that time (late 2010). The Surround uses a slower 16GB Sandisk SD hard for its internal memory (it is not swappable, and cannot be removed). The result is that the phone takes a lot longer loading apps then other phones using NAND memory such as the Focus.If you are looking for a cheap replacement smartphone running WP7, the Samsung Focus is a better alternative. If you want something running WP8, try the Nokia 520. This phone simply has no real advantage over anything else on the market today, even for bargain hunters.",3.0,1368921600,"05 19, 2013","HTC T8788 7 Surround Unlocked Phone with Windows 7, Surround Sound, 5MP Camera and HD Video - US Warranty - Black",78.77,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41DBpWCuExL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 27895},HTC,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",-1.0

I played with it from time to time and found it easy to use and very stable (unlike my Android phone), and the slideup speakers to be cool. It eventually inspired me to buy an HTC Radar 4G and switch to T-Mobile as my carrier. I love WinPhone 7.5, so much so that I wanted to become a developer.Which led me to purchase this ""unlocked"" phone, to use as a development phone. I purchased it from OEM Planet (aka Young Kimbrogh) fulfilled by Amazon.com.  Unfortunately the phone never worked.  It would turn on, show the HTC logo, and then just vibrate and reboot itself.  I even purchased a genuine AT&T; SIM card and activated the SIM card (against my wishes... as I'd had some real bad experience with AT&T; before!) but it didn't make no difference, the phone simply refused to go beyond the logo screen!Guys...

B004KFXTOA,A3CW0ZLUO5X2B1,"35-year Technology Consumer ""8-tracks to 802.11""","[137, 144]","Before addressing the hardware and functionality of this phone, let's address quickly the five-part equation that makes up your overall smart phone user experience:(1) the hardware...the phone itself(2) operating system software(3) installed applications(4) the network (overall, and where you happen to be using the phone at a particular time)(5) the service providerIn some cases, there are serial dependencies on the factors above, as many phones are tied to specific operating systems or service providers. Or perhaps you spend a lot of time in an area without 4G service. Just remember that even if you make a great phone choice, deficiencies in the other areas can diminish your overall user experience.Don't move to a smart phone without some research into these choices. Which provider? Which mobile operating system? Who can offer me the best service, or the best combination of value and service? The rest of this review assumes you've already figured out why a phone with the Android operating system might be a better choice for you than an iPhone, a Blackberry or a Windows-based smart phone solution...Bottom line for the HTC EVO 4G: feature loaded, user-friendly and a hard choice to go wrong with in a crowded smart phone market.The phone ships with an impressive array of capability and apps, and finding and installing new ones from the Android marketplace is easy even for non-techies.Two very strong performers in the pre-installed applications are Google-powered Voice Search and Navigate: both are eerily good at delivering search results and driving/walking directions. This phone's voice-to-text interface is also very good, and can be used for both composing text messages and delivering search results without typing. Surprisingly, a voice-based dialing app that is part of the operating system's collection of widgets seldom gets one right. The Evo's on-screen keyboard is adaptive to your compositions over time, and will suggest auto-completes for words you frequently type.The phone includes two cameras: an outward facing high resolution (8 megapixel) still/video camera, and a front facing 1.3 megapixel camera for video applications. It ships with an 8 GB microSD card. One surprising oversight of this phone is the placement of the microSD card inside the battery compartment. Although you can move files to an from it via the USB port, this phone would be improved if the card were accessible without removing the back cover.In addition to the USB port, the phone has a 3.5mm aux audio jack and an HDMI port.The rear of the phone includes a ""kickstand"", allowing you to stand the phone on a horizontal surface when viewing the display in landscape mode (great for using the speakerphone or watching videos).Customization of the scrolling display screens is intuitive. In our house, even less technically savvy users were re-arranging icons and applications in no time.Each of phone, video and still image quality are satisfactory.The overall finish of this phone is --literally-- quite slick. It can go sliding easily on leather car seat, and both the screen and frame will attract and display fingerprints. Whether or not you opted in to the damage/loss insurance that most providers offer, I'd strongly recommend both a screen protector and some case or holster to offer a modicum of protection to the phone.Mnay options exist for protection, but for our multiple Evo phones we've found the following to provide a good mix of protection and price:--""Fishbone"" protective case (red linked here; other colors are available)--SGP STEINHEIL Anti FingerprintSprint Screen Protector (Anti Fingerprint)Let these protective devices soak up the wear and tear instead of your phone and display.Other reviews have discussed battery life, and it's worth addressing. This phone has five separate radio transmit/receive devices:-the standard cellular (3G/CDMA) transceiver-the 4G transceiver-Bluetooth (for short-range use of hands-free devices and data exchange)-GPS receiver-Wifi transceiverEach of these devices will exert its own demand on the battery. Selectively turning them off when not needed, along with setting a shorter time to turn off the display (2 minutes or 1 minute) will go a long way to mitigate the battery issue. Additionally, there are extended life aftermarket batteries (usually with an accompanying modified case cover to accommodate their their additional bulk) that will easily get you through your work day away from external power.A note about apps:Android is a Google operating system, and access to the Android marketplace for additional apps requires entry through a Google/Gmail account (either existing or one you create when setting up the phone). In return for the apps, be aware that you surrender significant personal information on your phone, your location (at minumum the nearest cell tower, and in some cases your GPS-derived location) and details of how you used the phone and applications. Providing this information is the cost of admission for functionality of the apps. I'm not offering a value judgement on this...just pointing it out for your information.Finally, a note about pricing:Comparison shop and pay attention when you're ready to make the move to a smart phone. For the hardware purchase, you can expect to find considerable differences in the prices (even when upgrade discount and rebates are included) from different vendors. Be sure to check out each each of your provider's ""store"" (brick and mortar, by phone and online), big box stores and even Amazon's new wireless store. It's worth investing a couple minutes in this research to save a considerable amount on the purchase price.Becoming a smart phone user begins with shopping smartly! )-",5.0,1297900800,"02 17, 2011",HTC EVO 4G Android Smartphone Sprint - No Warranty,87.48,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416dYw2sAlL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3402},HTC,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0

Both have had their quirks.Mine: Randomly will reload the home screen when I exit an application.  A minor, yet annoying little bug.  I'm not sure if it has something to do with the ""live"" desktop that I use. Otherwise, it's a great phone.Hers: Randomly has SERIOUS camera problems.  Will either go to a black screen or a screen that is rainbow colored when the camera is selected.  Removing the battery and reinserting it usually will fix it, but it's maddening when you have to pry off the Trident Case that I bought for her to protect the thing.Overall, I really like the phone..just have some issues",4.0,1326672000,"01 16, 2012",HTC EVO 4G Android Smartphone Sprint - No Warranty,87.48,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416dYw2sAlL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3402},HTC,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0
B004KFXTOA,A2U1WHVMK9MRJ9,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","I got this phone after having an LG Optimus for one year. I was pleased with the performance of the LG and thought that it was great for my needs. However, I had a friend playing with his EVO and asked to play a little. The processor on the EVO is insane, the screen and display look amazing and the feel of the phone is great. The screen is an inch larger than the LG, but the phone itself is only 1/2 inch taller and less than 1/2 an inch wider than the LG, making it still easy to fit in a pocket. I have downloaded apps on both 3G and Wifi and can't believe how much faster it is than the LG. The battery life is pretty similar to the LG, it lasts from 0700 to about 1600, but I work in dungeon with no reception, so it's constantly draining looking for signal, common for any phone I have seen in this place. Extra batteries are cheap and easy to swap out.My wife just got an iphone 4s and I was thinking about one also, I'm glad I went with the EVO, bigger screen, SD card, seems more user friendly and I don't have to worry about Siri telling me that she can't answer my question and suggesting I Google it, if I wanted to Google it, I would have in the first place.The ability to add apps to have different launchers and themes gives the Android platform an edge over the iphone, IMO. The boasts of the Apple market having more apps means little to me, everything I can think of is available in some form on Android. Seems to me that there is quite a bit of duplication of many apps on both. Having the Adobe preloaded and not having to Root or Jailbreak my phone to have it is also an edge, one that my wife hates.I ordered the High-Quality SlimLine Tough Case in BLACK for the HTC EVO 4G Phone - Slim Design with Chrome Accents for my phone and it doesn't seem to add much bulk but is very sturdy.The only things I didn't care for were the original lock screen and HTC Sense due to lack of features, these were easy fixes with the download of 2 apps, (lockmenu and GO Launcher EX). This phone is far superior to many that I have seen available, I don't need 3D, and Swype works well on the larger keyboard so I don't long for a physical keyboard on the Shift, even without swype, the keyboard is just as good as the iphone. The speaker is loud and clear on both speakerphone and music, the camera is great and has many options for enhancement. The kickstand is a nice plus, but I have only watched one video, so it doesn't get much use.",5.0,1330646400,"03 2, 2012",HTC EVO 4G Android Smartphone Sprint - No Warranty,87.48,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416dYw2sAlL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3402},HTC,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0

B004KFXTOA,A18MBO1U4DPY20,Harkanwar Anand,"[59, 65]","My Samsung phone Android experience was slightly different than my HTC Android phone experience. HTC is definitely better, more stable, browsing is better, battery life is worse but the overall quality and the sturdiness of the phone in question is penultimate. Let me try to tell you why I am so enamored by this phone.1. The browsing is excellent, the downloading is quick, the web pages load in seconds and even on 3G the phone is super fast, I have never switched on the 4G for more than an hour and feel it should only be done when you're downloading a very big file. You may wonder what the purpose of 4G is, so well, although the 4G function is there, this phone is faster than any 3G phones available on the network by a mile (Hero, Moment, Optimus S to name a few) So the browsing is excellent.2. I used GPS once while trying to locate a bar a friend of mine was at in downtown. Anyone who's been to downtown manhattan knows what a headache directions are there but using this I got there just in time. Yes, it takes a bit of getting used to and yes if you forget to switch the GPS off, the phone is going to complain and be really hot.3. Of maybe the seven or eight phones I've used in my life time, this one has the loudest speaker when using Pandora. It is very clear at the same time. While the EPIC may have a louder speaker, the Evo has the clear one, for hours at a time I let it play at volume level 2 with the screen switched off and it is the most delightful jukebox. There are several applications for music and the phone's customization and level of speed and concentration is nothing short of excellent. It never confuses between two running apps and multi-tasking is the best on any phone. Credit to Android and HTC Sense developers.4. The kickstand is a unique feature which can be helpful once in a way, the back of the black EVO is smooth and a pleasure to hold in your hands. The QWERTY touchscreen is really good and I have almost mastered it. When I was using the Nexus S, the touchscreen keyboard was awful. The touchscreen on this phone is the best i have seen on any phone. It is maybe better than my ipod touch too which now is a device i never touch. I don't need to use SWYPE cause I'm fast enough holding the phone vertically.5. The alarm feature is just awesome and I had to make a point about it because even if you're listening to music it will give two sounds, one for the music, the other for the alarm, functionality and customization again get a big score here. The NOTIFICATION bar is the best I've seen on any Android phone.6. The BATTERY life is horrid. Worse than Samsung phones. I have a solution that will cost you money. There is a Seidio battery which goes into your phone but doesn't require an extended back. Get that and you will get a day with your phone. With the STOCK BATTERY, there is no use using your phone.7. One of my BIGGEST COMPLAINTS with this phone is the earphone speaker being way too low. When I'm in a busy room full of people, I always have to get up and go out. With my Blackberry or Samsung I never had to this. So yes, this is not the best phone in the world to talk with. It's a very big flaw and makes me dislike the phone immensely. When you plug in headphones, it is loud enough of course but who does that everyday or all the time? not me i guess.8. Ships with 8GB memory, the touchscreen is flawless and never skips a single beat, the phone never freezes and yes, it has restarted itself once or twice since I have had it but I have never had a phone that doesn't ever reboot once in a way so can't complain. I don't use any app killer, at night i keep my brightness to the lowest level, I restart my phone daily to kill any apps running in the background. I use Winamp for playing music. There are several shortcut and widget options. The phone has a beautiful time display, weather display and quite a sense of humor too. The four capacitive buttons always work.The GREEN NOTIFICATION light is friendly and not too urgent like the Blackberry's RED. I know it is silly to compare but I am silly. The camera is just awful to be honest. Though better than the Blackberry, it is still very difficult to take pictures in the night. The flash is too flashy and washes out the face. Netflix runs smooth, I haven't cracked the screen yet but I've seen several cracked Evo's. I didn't bother rooting it or any of that nonsense.Overall, a solid phone with 2 flaws I can live with. I am not going to deduct any marks because the phone has several stand outs.",5.0,1315872000,"09 13, 2011",HTC EVO 4G Android Smartphone Sprint - No Warranty,87.48,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416dYw2sAlL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3402},HTC,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0

Not sure if the battery is the culprit or if the phone somehow heats them up and causes the bulge but never the less, once bulged the batteries move as you push on the phone causing the battery contacts to separate and the phone turns off instantly.  You then power it back up and it seems to have plenty of charge.  You then are in a nasty loop so the phone looks happy but as soon as you start punching at it you torque the phone and the battery and it goes black.So, as soon as many of us ditched these ""HTC"" labeled batteries and either put in new ones or other manufacturer's batteries, power problems disappeared.There is a reason these are so cheap.

This extended battery has solved that problem.  Though it adds a noticeable bulge and heft to the phone, neither is an issue for me; and actually makes the phone easier to hold - less likely to slip from my hand as the original slim profile could.My only gripe is that one side of the extended cover doesn't snap into place as snugly as the other side, leaving it feeling like it might pop off; so I may return it for a replacement.  (Update: I should have returned this but it's too late now.  The poor-fitting battery cover seems to be loosening up over time and requires that I constantly check it.)Battery life seems excellent.  On one rare occasion when I had the phone on all day at work, the battery appeared down by about half at the end of the day.  Though I didn't use it much that day, I'm guessing that the battery drain was due to constant signal searching in a poor indoor reception area.  Otherwise, no 4G reception issues with the battery cover antenna that some have reported.Yes, it's worth getting, but hope your battery cover fits better than mine.  (Update: I no longer think this is worth buying from this seller.  I originally contacted them about the poor fitting cover and they wanted me to send them a photograph of the defect.

Not sure if they are actually genuine HTC (I order from CCMaccessories) but they seem to do the trick.  I've ordered probably a couple dozen by now.  As the price has doubled over the past year it's probably a good time to perform some benchmarks (and perhaps tear one apart test one).CCMaccessories sends them quickly, within a few days or so through the USPS.EDIT:  these have worked for many mobile devices/etc until trying them on more advanced mobiles (such as the Galaxy S series & such) - they do not perform well on any of these more modern devices.  For instance I can use an old Samsung or even an old Motorola charger that I have to charge my Galaxy S4, but these cable perform/charge at a very reduced rate (no matter if I plug them into a 1 or 2 amp charger).

I received the item as advertised before Christmas and was able to activate it just as they said. It seemed to worked great and we moved on. In the coming weeks I noticed that when I was talking to my wife,  she would start sounding very far away and I would have to strain to hear her. I was constantly asking her to ""talk louder"" or ""can you say that again"". BUT, by the time I figured out it was the phone (I bought her for Christmas), and I wasn't the only one to have this problem while talking to her, I had gone past the 30 day limit. So, I didn't call about it. Later a review reminder came to me in an email so I gave a review of three stars because it worked but was a pain and most of the time you have to reboot it to get to work right. ( Its not like there is a volume control for the microphone). Then, Sun 3-4-12, I get a call about my review asking if I will change it or is their anything they can do to make it better. I said ""replacing the phone would help"". He said he WOULD replace it and he WOULD call me back in 1 1/2 hours to let me know what I needed to do. I'm thinking great! I can't believe he said he would do that after 2 months and 20 days. What a great company!  Then, no phone call. So I waited, just to be polite. Then this afternoon I thought I would contact them, to see what I needed to do, and when I looked I couldn't find my review. Wow! How did that happen? So here it is and now I will keep checking and rewriting this review every week till it stays. Bottom line...... It's one thing to get a bad product.

It's very user friendly and really nice.The downsides are that it doesn't have a rear-facing camera (no selfies, ever) and the camera it does have is very low quality.

I was patient with it because I knew based on the specs, the solid feel and the hardware, that it was potentially a good phone. Apparently the seller buys them new in bulk from the manufacturer, doesn't test them and just sends them to Amazon to sell. The first 2 came with issues and had to be returned..the return process was ok, inconvenient but ok, Amazon was great about it as well as the seller. On my 3rd try, everything worked well. It's fast and user-friendly with great features, if you're familiar with androids. When I 1st got it, it came with no manual and since I had other smartphones that weren't androids, I had to teach myself everything...not brain surgery but inconveniently time consuming..which paid off and I'm now happy with it. You can't beat this price for a decent new smartphone..it may be over 2 years old but it will do what you need it to. Also, as long as you don't expect a manual with it ..and you know that you really need to test all the functions &parts well before relaxing with it, you'll be just fine. :-)",5.0,1363478400,"03 17, 2013","HTC A8181 G2 Vision Google Android Unlocked Phone with 5MP Camera, Music Player, QWERTY Keyboard and Wi-Fi - Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Titanium",399.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41v4uo16xLL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 91280},HTC,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0

My original one was wearing out, not holding a charge very long, and of course it was older than 1yr, so my carrier wouldn't replace it. Last time I bought one from my carrier it was outrageously expensive, so I checked Amazon this time, and I was pleasantly surprised. Low, low cost for equal quality. This one will last me fine until its time to upgrade my phone.)Above is my first review/impressions of this product. However...after using this battery for a while, I started to have issues with my phone doing weird things...crashing, etc. Once it gets bad like it was, the usual fix is to remove the battery, then put it back in. Well, this battery swelled up to where I had a lot of difficulty removing it! I had to get 2 small screwdrivers to wedge it out of my phone! I screwed up my volume buttons doing so, but at least I got this battery out...and it will never go back in my phone again!I've never had an issue with anything I've ever bought from Amazon, so I was kinda surprised when this happened.",1.0,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",Htc Inspire 4G Desire HD G10 (HTC HD) Replacement Lithium-Ion Cell Phone Battery (1500 mAh),4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SU5VluoEL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 55797},HTC,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Batteries', 'Internal Batteries']]",1.0

You can't have a case on your phone to match up the charger point.

If you have the original HTC charger that came with your phone, that is what you need--but you can buy adapter chargers with a USB  port.

I like to listen to music on my phone, so I thought it would be convenient to have it propped up so I can wheel around my screen, etc.  It would also be great for watching videos, sitting up so you don't have to hold it or if you're doing something else while just listening.

Wish I did.[...]CONS: On a different review someone said that HTC EVO DESK DOCKING options were pre-programmed on the phone so it may not be an issue with the docking itself but I figured it was still important to know. Bluetooth activates instantly with no option to turn off function plus once it is taken off the cradle it doesn't automatically revert to original setting forcing you to manually turn it off. Same goes for the ring tone, it automatically goes to silent while on docking mode except it does go back to original setting once removed. Doesn't come with any sort of instructions which would be handy specially since there is a VIDEO bottom except I'm not sure what it's function is.

And it has gotten better since I first got it, and it more than doubles the life of the stock battery. With my stock battery I was charging at least once a day, sometimes twice with heavy use (averaging about 12-14 hours). With the 3600 I charge on average every 2 days. My last 4 battery times were 46 hours, 37 hours, 42 hours, and 46 hours. These are all with moderate use, and at the time I hooked up the charger the battery was still at 15%. I dont like running it down to 0.So if your out there wondering if this is worth it because ""you get what you pay for"", at least in my case that saying isn't true here. Now there's no way to know how long this battery will last, but if it dies on me and I remember I will update this review.",5.0,1315526400,"09 9, 2011",HTC EVO 3D / HTC EVO 3D Sprint Extended Capacity 3600mAh Li-Ion Battery + Battery Door Cover Mobile Phone Repair Parts Replacement,13.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41bXjjXBB5L._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 147162},HTC,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Accessory Kits']]",1.0

Pros:  large beautiful screen which is especially good for my poor eyesight, nice interface and very smooth operation - with no lockups, and I don't think MS snoops in all of my email the way G**gle does!!  The build quality is very nice - this isn't a cheap plasticky phone.Cons:  I have tested my Titan against five other phones - in the same location and same carrier - and the Titan has the poorest / worst cellular reception.  It simply cannot hold onto a connection where the other phones could.  Also, so far it is not eligible for the upgrade to WP 7.8 - although that ""upgrade"" brings little to the table.  Not the Titan's fault but the Windows Marketplace is still seriously lacking.  And, even though the screen is pretty nice - it is a low resolution screen thanks to Windows Phone's hastily rushed to the market OS (only one screen resolution available on WP7).Other:  The Titan was sold as unlocked but it arrived locked to AT&T.;  To their credit, the seller was very responsive in getting an unlock code.  The box was obviously used and shopworn - and the Titan itself has a small blemish on the metal near the screen.  I suspect it is a refurb but I can't prove it.  That being said, it is a very nice phone and I am keeping it.******************** Edited on 24 MAR to add comments *************************This phone continues to not impress me.  To it's credit, the screen is large, bright and easy to read.  And, it runs smoothly and quickly.  When it is able to receive a celluar signal, it quickly connects, updates and downloads e-mail.  But, the key term here is reception.  I just tested it again at my place in Germany.  I have seven active SIM cards (Germany is pre-paid Heaven!) so I took the Titan and my iPhone4 to the basement laundry room where I live.  Both phones had a chip from the same carrier - LeBara - which uses the Telekom network here.  The iPhone4 - not 4s - had three bars of signal and cellular data worked.  My Titan had no signal - no nothing.  I wish I had known about this before I bought it.  And, I want to again warn anyone who might read this - closely check the seller's rating before you buy a phone here that is NOT shipped and sold directly by Amazon.

B005ML7OWO,A2NJQF2UI60VGT,ChicagoCPA,"[0, 0]","If you are reading this review, you are looking for an cheap LTE phone that works well and I'd say this one qualifies.  It is in fact my backup phone should something happen to my HTC Droid DNA within the next 17 months.  I still use it as a wake up alarm clock and bring it out when the kids deserve some App time.When this phone came out, it was fast, but compared to today's 4 core phones, it seems very slow now, but in 2011, it seemed fast.- Update 2/10/2013 - Verizon finally rolled out the ICS (Ice Cream Sandwich) update and I have just updated my Thunderbolt to Android 4.0.4 HTC Sense 3.6.  Since I had already replaced this with a HTC Droid DNA as my primary phone, I had to borrow for an hour my wife's HTC Thunderbolt's SIM card and I had no problem getting the update and it installed without a hitch.  It is working well and I would highly recommend the update, there are a lot of nice things that come with going from Android 2.3 to Android 4.0.  In particular, I like being able to create folders now.  Since my Thunderbolt is now an alarm clock / backup-phone-in-case-I-break-my-DNA / Kid's Game machine for the foreseeable future, I wanted it to be as up to date as possible while the update was available.- Update 7/17/2012 - I still like my phone very much and have no regrets at all in buying it. It has been easy to buy accessories and it is one of the first phones to get updates and such.- Update 10/20/2011 - after 5 months I still have no regrets.  I still like my phone and I am especially happy to have been able to get grandfathered into the unlimited rate plans while they lasted (rather than waiting for a dual core phone) as I often go over 10GB per month.>- Update: I have had this phone since 5/11/2011. If you are buying the phone NOW, you are looking for a cheap LTE phone and this HTC Thunderbolt should fit the bill nicely.- Original Review (modified):Some of difference between this phone and others that I would bring to your attention would be:- The HTC Sense browsers word wraps when you pinch zoom into a web page and I love this feature.  Few other phones do this.- The TB has 8GB of onboard memory and 70% of that memory is not available for you to use.This may seem irrelevant with the 32GB SD card that came with it, however many apps will not let you move them to an SD Card- The Thunderbolt feels sturdy and very professional.  I have dropped it numerous times and it has had no ill effect that I can tell.- There is no HDMI port, however this phone does not quite have enough oomph to be a huge video driver anyway.- I REALLY like TB's FastBoot (I turn it ""off"" every night -- I suspect 1GB of the unavailable memory is used for this feature, tho ideally it would be called suspend so you can still have a true ""off"" at the same time)- Hulu and Netflix and Skype all work well (all of which work much better with LTE)- The after-market has favored the HTC Thunderbolt.- There are a TON of reviews on this phone. Most are either 1 star or 4 star. If you remove the battery issue from the equation, the vast majority of people love it.- Yes, they SHOULD have given it a bigger battery, but to keep up with the trend of ""thin is in"", they didn't.  It is a great deal thinner than my Tilt2. So... moving on...- If you are getting horrible better battery life, my main recommendation would be keep the LTE radio off until you need to use it and turn it off again when you are done.  Here in Chicago, there are enough LTE towers that my phone does not drain too much battery life hunting for a signal.  I can easily go 10+ hours on the built in battery.  I routinely get well over 48 hours with the 2,750 mah battery with the 4G/LTE radio on the entire time.- That big and bright screen (for 1/1/2011) devours batteries and with unlimited 4G service and a fast 1GHz processor, you will have it on 3 times as much as you ever thought you would. It is that enjoyable to use. Perhaps this is the source for many of the complaints.  I know we have our screens on far, far longer than we ever had before.- Unlike my mother's HTC phone or my sisters iPhone, I have never once had an issue with my cheek hanging up on people or putting them on hold while I talk (and neither has my wife).  The phone really can tell when you are holding it against your face and turns the screen off as appropriate and turns it back again as soon as you take it away.- More battery tips: I try to always back out of programs until I get to the home screen to make sure they are not running in the background when I turn it off.  I never bother killing an app. Every time our battery seems to not last very long, it is fully attributable to keeping the screen on for extended periods, usually for extended internet browsing or facebooking.  In those instances, I just expect to plug it in soon, as I have with every notebook computer I have ever owned.  Everywhere we turn, we have an option to plug it in, so no big deal.- I can stream 3 straight hours of video over LTE on battery power on my 2,750 battery and still be only down 2 bars (20%).- I normally want a backup battery anyway, so I got an extended battery.  I actually like the extra heft and ridge to hold it. I have fewer worries about battery life than any of my previous 3 smartphones.- Unlimited LTE exposes a wide host of options I never before considered, like streaming Pandora or Hulu while at my desk at the office without going thru the firm's firewall (since it is against stated policy to do so).  This would be an occasion where I would just keep it plugged in.- Before ordering a new phone, I call the phone company to get the unlock code of my previous phone before deactivating it so I can use a SIM card from another country on that phone.  They will generally have no problem doing this when it is out of contract.Regarding getting the phone from AmazonWireless:------------------------------------------------Wow, what a price. 130 plus activation fees (which my corporate account allowed me to avoid) vs 250 from vzw.If you want more control over sorting/filtering the reviews, go to Amazon.com to read these same reviews (instead of wireless.amazon.com)I ordered the phone late at night on the 9th and received it bright and early on the 11th from KY (the delivery estimate was for the 12th).Regarding VerizonWireless initialization:----------------------------------------------I did not turned the phones on (I let VZW do this), but I did charge them up for an hour before heading off to the local VZW store for activation (as AmazonWireless does not do corporate discounts nor phone number rollovers for new family accounts)I arrived without a employment photo id (do not have one) nor a amount-redacted paycheck stub, so I was sent back home to get one as they do not discuss corporate discounts without such proof.I also needed to bring the AT&T; account number (which I got by calling 611, but bringing the invoice would have been faster).I also should have printed that email that AmazonWireless sent with the phone numbers as it would have speeded up the process.VZW first activated the phone numbers that arrived with the phones and then ported over our AT&T; #s and about 1 hour later the AT&T; phones were disconnected and the new phones were ready to use with our old #s. (very fast)If you order more than one phone... keep everything separate! I threw everything into one bag and they spend a good 10 minutes looking up their records to figure out which 4G card went with which phone. I still suspect it did not matter, but they wanted to be on the safe side.If you arrive with your old phones and your google account information handy, they were happy to assist you in setting it up and transferring the data over (I did not, so I did it myself)I receive a Welcome to VZW text next day with links to walk me thru setting it up (I have not yet used this, but I have kept it as it seems it may be useful)I have found thru my own experience and a good amount of googling, that the cheaper data plan is fine if you are using Corporate Microsoft Exchange email with ActiveSync. I am not sure why they have two plans and neither did the folks at the Verizon Wireless store.Regarding the phone itself:--------------------------------To use the speakerphone, there is an option to just put it face down on a flat surface.I almost wish it had a stylus. I clicked the wrong item far too often, but I am getting much better at it.It feels very solid and pleasant to hold and has already survived two 4' falls onto concrete.  get a screen protector ASAP!  I didn't and it is now badly scratched, but the Zagg screen protector made these scratches invisible.)As a phone, it does not have the best voice quality by any means, but it is usable and loud enough. It sounds much like our computer sounding VOIP system at work rather than a traditional voice line (it SEEMS to be doing VOIP over 4G, in which case it would affect most 4G phones. The same quality was mentioned in a review of the Charge). I was in upper Door County last weekend where there is no 3G signal and sure enough, voices sounded human again.I was surprised to find that headphones must be unplugged when receiving a phone call, otherwise the mic does not work. You need an adaptor with a mic that allows for quality headphones to listen to music. I just unplug the headphones.I use it for listening to music with headphones A LOT. (Pandora or FM Radio)The camera is okay, but not nearly as good as I was hoping, however the software to control it has a lot of cool options for a cell phone.A lot of gripe has been made about the position of the usb port and I agree it probably should have been place on the other side of the phone so you can view it on the kickstand sideways while plugged in.The designers likely put it there for the HTC Desktop Docking Station for HTC Thunderbolt Docking stationCharges HTC Thunderbolt with standard or extended battery on deviceCharges Spare Standard or Extended BatteryAngled for better viewingHOWEVER!!! Since I have the Seidio extended battery, I use Seidio's case for this phone which that has a kickstand built into it that allows you to view it from either side (usb side up) and they also sell a desktop docking station in which you do not have to remove this case.Seidio ACTIVE Case for HTC 2750mAh and Seidio Innocell Extended Life Batteries for HTC ThunderBolt - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - BlackandSeidio BD3-CRDHTMEC Desktop Cradle Kit for HTC ThunderBolt - Cradle - Retail Packaging - Black(tho the BD2 alternative is 10 bucks cheaper by not including a travel charger).As not all apps rotate to allow you to have the USB port up, the docking station was a good buy for me and allows the volume buttons to be on the top and easily accessible.A lot of gripe has been made about the lack of an HDMI out. Know that there is a Media Link Adaptor coming soon that will allow you to view on HDMI via DLNA (tho it costs WAY too much money... but wireless does make more sense). Personally, I do not see the point. I already have a HTPC setup, so I have a much better method to stream video to my HDMI TV.I had to buy adaptors and cables for the multiple locations we charge (home/work/car).BlackBerry USB Cable Micro USB 1.0m (Black)Amzer Handy Converter Mini USB Connector to Micro USBI have no problems with WiFi or USB tethering. LTE is faster than my home DSL connection.PDANet would not work without first installing HTCSync (and then uninstalling it... it leaves behind the drivers you want... there are three different uninstall icons), but once installed, I was getting 7Mbps down and 1.7Mbps up via usb modem on my notebook according to DSL Reports (my at&t; dsl line maxes out at 2.6 Mbps down and 0.7 Mbps up).I have had no problems at all with it getting too hot.All my smartphones have been built by HTC and I have been content with their quality and they have been reasonably on top of their software updates.I experience no hiss at all listening to Pandora with my AKG K 272 HD High-Definition Headphones at any volume and I listen to it every workday and have a good ear (or so I like to think as a former musician).The Mount as Disk Drive option also seems to require HTCSync to be installed (see comments for link).  Again, you may uninstall HTCSync after it installed the underlying drivers you need.It is much closer of an experience to using a computer rather than a phone.  It certainly is faster and has a higher resolution screen than my first 4 computers, each of which cost thousands of dollars.  The AmazonApps store is addicting with its free app of the day and its abilty to browse the internet and see exactly the same website as on my desktop with just the same speed is abolutely amazing.  My ""7.2Mbps"" AT&T; Tilt2 had the ability (sans flash) but was so slow as to make it a waste of my time.Regarding Apps:--------------------As a new Andriod user, it took me days to figure out that you can swipe down the top bar and click on an app running in the background and be right back where you left off.  Too bad you cannot actually close apps from here tho.The video recording volume IS too low, but acceptable for my needs and there may be a software fix coming in the future.I use Swype, however I really like the HTC on-screen keyboard. A big reason for wanting a huge power draining screen was to have a surface large enough for my big fingers to hit the correct keys. I always had a physical keyboard before, and I was very reluctant to lose it. I still wish I could see the entire screen while typing, but it is not as bad as I had feared.Swype however still does not automatically include spaces in text messages (tho it does everywhere else) and it is still a bit of a pain to get it to work as expected when just typing letters.  It took a while to figure out that the back hardware button was used by Swype to hide the keyboard.Roboform is working quite nicely on it. It behaves like it is an entirely different internet browser. I tend to start at the Roboform list when I want to browse to a password protected website or a site I know I bookmarked within Roboform.I really like the HTC Sense UI. I am seeing no downside at all so far, but then again, I am not using it for email or contacts or facebook or tasks, I am using Touchdown to sync with my office's Exhange server. My wife uses Facebook every day, but uses the htc web browser not the HTC Facebook App.It is nice having at multiple AppStores to choose from: (VZW, AmazonApps, KindleBooks, and MarketAndroid) Interestingly enough, AmazonApps allows more than one phone on one account.Regarding Verizon's pre-loaded apps. Personally I think the issue is widely overblown. They seem to do little harm and do not consume any measurable amount of battery power.The wording on the Settings/Power/Fast Boot options is a bit confusing. You want to check the box to get fast boot. It defaults to NOT checked for broadest app compatibility. When FastBoot is enabled, the TB just hibernates instead of truly turning all the way off so it will turn on again and be usable in 10 seconds (tho reacquiring the signal take a bit longer). Nice if you want to conserve battery power and want to turn your phone ""off"" at night. If you want to reset your phone, just choose restart instead of power off.My TB arrived with Android 2.2.1, then Verizon updated it to Android 2.3.4, then Android 4.0.4",4.0,1360454400,"02 10, 2013",HTC ThunderBolt 4G LTE Android Phone (Verizon Wireless),107.79,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kXiKd1hjL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1716},HTC,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0

B005ML7OWO,A2AZG70U6VI4Y7,Rocman,"[47, 51]","I have been using my HTC Thunderbolt for about a year now, and I have found it to be a very powerful phone with flaws that are inherent to a 1st gen product (with regard to 4G LTE).Pro:Screen size AND aspect ratio - the 4.3"" screen was big when this phone came out one year ago in July '11.  At the time, I thought this was going to be the physical limit on smartphone screen sizes - boy was I wrong haha  The resolution is 800x480, which is low by today's standard, but this was the highest resolution available on the android side at the time of this phone's launch.  One thing I've come to love is the screen's aspect ratio.  This phone has very thin bezels framing the screen.  I simply love this.  Compared to the a same size 4.3"" 720P phone (ex. Rezound), the Thunderbolt's screen is noticeably wider and negligibly shorter.  This makes for a much more useful screen in everyday use, such as Google map, browsing, etc.  The Rezound's 720P screen, which by the way is gorgeous and has even higher pixel density than the ""retina display"" on the iphone 4s, shows you less content except with movies and videos, where its 16:9 ratio minimizes black bars.  Honestly though, I don't watch much video on my phone, and I prefer to see more in things like Google map versus less black bar while watching video.4G LTE - this was the first 4G phone for Verizon, and it was a SCREAMER.  When I first got the phone last summer, Verizon was just rolling out its 4G network.  Here in NC, I was getting anywhere from 25 to 50 Mbps download and 8 to 15+ Mbps upload (verified by the Speedtest ookla app).  The download speed has tapered off a bit now, no doubt due to the fact that now most people are on 4G.  But still, it's pretty incredible that my phone's connection is comparable to my Road Runner Turbo (20/2 here in NC) at home!  The upload speed is actually much, much faster than my RR turbo.Using internet/data while on a call - this phone is actually able to do simultaneous data and call over BOTH 3G and 4G!  I could not believe Verizon did not advertise this out the wazoo, because at the time of launch, AT&T; was making an ad attack on Verizon saying Verizon's network could not handle using internet while on a call.  This was true, except for the Thunderbolt!  I've personally verified this on both 3G and 4G.  I was able to access apps, check emails and in general use data while on a call without any problem.  I didn't thought this would be a big deal until I had to look up directions on google map while during a call.  Very useful feature.Kickstand - this might be a love-it-or-hate-it thing, but I've found the kickstand on this phone to be VERY useful.  It's elegantly designed and very robustly built.  The hinge has a solid and satisfying spring assisted snap to it.  You can prop up the phone both portrait and landscape.  For one thing, this makes the phone a super alarm clock for me without the need for a dock.  I am a minimalist by nature and I love it!Call quality - believe it or not, I still make calls with my phone - sometimes :)  The sound quality for both incoming and outgoing is great.  And as much as I hate Verizon's more expensive plans, they do have a very decent network which no doubt contributes to this phone's great call quality.Good build quality - I've dropped this phone once or twice without a case and it's survived gracefully.  There are scratches of course, but I am very impressed.  Overall there are no creaks or otherwise cheap feel to this phone.  Very impressive since it's not built on an uni-body construction.Cons:Battery life - this has to be the biggest drawback for this phone.  Being a first generation 4G phone, this phone used a discrete 4G modem chip that was power hungry.  Combine that with a woefully small OEM battery (only 1400 mah), and you have very bad battery life performance.  It's like outfitting a Corvette with a two gallon capacity fuel tank.  You can go really fast but you will be out of juice very soon, too.Over the past year, I've been able to coax a useful almost-one-day battery life out of this phone by a) forcing it to 3G and b) rooting it to get rid of the Verizon bloatware.  There is also the extended battery, which doubles the battery capacity (2750 mah) but adds a bump and more weight to an already bulky phone.  Recently, I bought a Rezound OEM battery, which fits this phone with the standard battery cover.  The difference was very noticeable!  That battery should have shipped with the Thunderbolt.  I would definitely recommend getting a Rezound battery (I bought from Amazon for $12) for this phone.Bulk - this phone is not wafer thin nor feathery light.  The weight I actually don't mind - it feels like the premium product.  I wish the phone could be thinner, though.  What really makes the size a bit frustrating is the fact that with this bulk, HTC could have fitted a much larger battery inside, thus alleviating the battery life issue.Speakerphone position - the speaker on this phone is hidden behind the kickstand when it's flush against the phone.  Therefore, the sound is a little bit muffled, unless you open the kickstand.  Not a big deal really, as it is still plenty loud.Data connectivity - this phone had some teething problems with the initial software (froyo).  After the upgrade to Gingerbread (android 2.3), this phone was much, MUCH better and stable.  Of course, mine is rooted so... ;)[Update March 1st, 2013]FYI - Verizon released the Android 4.0 (ice cream sandwich or ICS) for the Thunderbolt!

Easy to use, great virtual keyboard/touchscreen alignment, plenty of pages to store apps on, and excellent battery life.  Battery life was initially nothing to write home about, but I'd used the Easy Battery Saver app before and installed it pronto -- now the battery lasts an average of 2 to 2 1/4 days (usage depending of course). Out of the box I was probably just barely getting through the day.Prior to this phone I had a Motorola Droid 2, Droid, and an HTC Eris and I like the Incredible 2 the best of them all . The Droids were nice, but they were heavy and clunky. The Eris was nice until an Android software update essentially destroyed its virtual keyboard to touchscreen alignment.This Incredible 2 is thin enough for me, lightweight compared to the others I had, and the screens are totally easy to use. Text is very simple, and email setup was a breeze. It works perfectly with Google Navigator and I have even lost my Garmin GPS having not used it since getting this phone.How could it be better? Well, it does come preloaded with apps that you can't get rid of like Verizon Navigator, Skype, Slacker Radio, Books, Facebook, Flickr, Amazon Kindle, NFL Mobile, Peep, YouTube and other byte stealers that I really do not care about using on my phone... would be nice to be able to delete them altogether, but hiding them works OK too.I like and recommend this phone, but suggest that you get very aggressive right away with VZW Customer Service if you get a lemon and hopefully they would treat you like they did me and send a replacement that was outstanding.",5.0,1354060800,"11 28, 2012",HTC DROID Incredible 2 Android Phone 6350 (Verizon Wireless),119.98,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413q3PQg30L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 6490},HTC,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0
B005OWWF66,A1PJVW2GSF73E7,thejmjohnson,"[6, 6]","I bought this phone to replace my Droid X2. I loved that phone alot. But after about 18 months of use, that phone had finally died off. I will start off by saying when doing this review, you do have to take in consideration that this phone has been out over 2 years now, so it will have some disadvantages.That being said there are both really good and bad aspects of this phone.One of my favorite features is the speaker phone mode; while on a phone call if set the phone face down, it will automatically switch to speaker phone. This comes in handy while driving and i use this everyday.Another feature i enjoy is the menus option. There are four options to choose from when displaying apps. ""All Apps, Frequent, Downloaded & Verizon"" I keep my phone set on the ""Frequent"" setting. It will display your 16 most used apps.The call quality on this phone is actually decent to good. In comparsion to my driod x2 people can hear me alot better. And i tend to be able to hear better.The HTC Sense User Interface is great too. I love the little weather widget. Whatever the weather is the phone screen will actually display that. Meaning when its raining the phone shows rain and wiper blades wipe it away. Really cool Feature.While the phone has some good aspects, there are also some not so great factors.The battery life, like most smart phones, isnt that great. But in comparison to my droid x2, this battery life really blows. If you barely use your phone, you will not notice a problem. Moe than about 3 hours a day, and youll be running low. The charge time also takes atleast 4 hours for me.Another problem, i encounter is that phone will freeze up more and moore with time. Which isnt that uncommon, but like others have stated, the reboot time can be about five minutes and will use atleast 15% or more of your battery life.The actual phone itself, i have noticed, isnt very durable. The first few times it dropped  or fell, even just a little bit of distance then phone became deeply scratched and dented. Not exactly sure what its made from, but quality isnt  a strong feature. I bought a snap on case for this phone and its helped abit.For the starter to average user, this phone will do the job. Just dont expect wonders to be made while using it. Good sound quality, Great user interface and Verizon wireless coverage make this phone worth while._________________________________________________________________its now 6months later. my phone is now dead. doesnt ring, wifi doesnt work, dead pixels and digitizer wiped. there are Better phones for the money.",3.0,1372982400,"07 5, 2013",HTC DROID Incredible 2 Android Phone 6350 (Verizon Wireless),119.98,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413q3PQg30L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 6490},HTC,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0

My phone didn't come with the SIM card however which I could have sworn it was supposed to.  I haven't yet seen about finding out to rectify that problem although that is one of the reasons why I bought the phone because I do travel.  Sometimes, I do have a problem seeing the screen in bright sunlight and it can run its battery down fairly fast but outside of that -- this phone is one of the best I've bought and its my first smartphone.  For me, since its my first smartphone, there was a bit of a learning curve and I think that I really only use about 2% of the phone's capability but I definitely use more of those smart capabilities than I did at first!  I can hear my callers very well, it takes excellent pictures -- too many extra apps on it that I don't use -- and the touchscreen keyboard is very good.

The one on this page is the 16 GB one, the 32 GB will cost a bit more and you need to write in search ""32 GB One X"", remember this phone has no slot for an external SD card, so more internal storage may be crucial for some!&lt;&lt;----Original review----I used so many brands and models of phones and smartphones than I can remember, and this one here, except for the memory card thing, covers every hole that was in every other phone I used. It also covers any thing u may have thought of having in a phone, and it is doing that in style! I tried the Samsung Galaxy S3 at at&t; before choosing the One x, and it really isn't better. I mean it is just about personal preferences, I always feel Samsung phones ( not all Samsung products, I love their TVs for example)have a cheap felling. Besides I liked how the One X looked more than the S3.Pros:-Amazing screen, and I am coming from a Motorola Droid Razr which has a very good screen itself. The screen here is sharper,  colors are better, no shadows(Razr had a green shadow on all colors. Watching Youtube or any vids on this phone is a thing I long for throughout the day!-Battery life is good enough for a full day with moderate use. Of course excessive movie watching, game playing or hours long web surfing require a twice chraging.-The 8 MP Camera deserves all the fuzz it received when first introduced, its pictures are steady, colors are vivid and quality is really high!-Speed: The phone handles multitasking very well, games and videos are a breath nothing you should worry about here.Cons:The only thing I didn't like about this phone, which is why I would say it is more like 4.5 stars not 5, is the lack of a memory card slot. I mean, seriously? it has a 2 year free subscription for extra storage online and everything, but whyyy?? How hard was it to add an extra slot for a memory card? An engineer's mistake without any doubt.Bottom line, if you want an Android phone go for the One X or the S3, can't make up your mind, try them both and just pick any of them you will end up with a winner either way!-----UPDATE------So I was tempted to get the S3 since I have a month to exchange the phone with at&t; and I wanted to know how better was the S3. I got the blue S3 and I certainly loved it, it doesn't feel cheap in hand as I expected, but it feels rather classy and here are my thoughts in comparison, I hope this experience may help other people decide:- The S3 overall look is really slick, it is ofcourse all about personal preferences as I said before, but sometime I wished that the One X looked more like the blue S3! the metal edges gave it some superiority no doubt about that, the blue finish was really good, but the white looks really cheap, don't think about it!- The Samsung motions( swipe to take a screen shot, raise the phone up to your ears with an open message to automatically dial the sender without pressing any keys & others) are really cool and are certainly a point above the OneX.- Sd card slot, as basic as it is , it is better than not having one!But that is it, these are the only things where the S3 bests the OneX- The Svoice(Smamsung reply to iPhone's Siri) Is totally useless, and certainly needs more development, a good idea that may get better in newer models, but not a plus for the S3, not to mention it consumes more battery when turned on.- The screen is different than the one X, I can't totally explain it, not the pixels density but mainly the colors. As I read online it looks like Samsung forgot to calibrate its screens, so as good as they are colors don't look natural. And you can't really feel it unless u spent some time with the OneX's gorgeous screen, colors aren't as vibrant or bright, a picture of a clear sea looks darker, less vivid and less colorful on the S3 than the One X and though really good, the One X is considerably better.- The camera is good, but again the One X's camera is definitely better both outdoor & indoor, may be not by much but the difference is definitely there.- Eye tracking: It was supposed to prevent the screen from sleeping when you are reading or surfing, well it doesn't do the job very well. In low light situations it is pretty much useless, since it depends on the front camera for eye tracking. In regular light it was ok, but again u had to hold to hold the phone in a certain way to make sure it ""sees"" your eye! I didn't find it that impressive..or useful!- Speed:same for both- Samsung's touchWiz vs htc Sense is an even battle I liked them both.- Battery: both are almost the same battery wise, though moderate to heavy use will definitely require a twice per day charging with both of them, you may be able to get enough juice till you get back home. Actually light use easily gets you through the day.Of course you can buy an extra battery with the S3 and swipe batteries cos the one X has a built in battery which the user can't replace on his own, but again you can buy a charging case for the oneX!Both have NFC which I didn't use in the ~ Two weeks period with each phone.-------Conclusion-------If you want a better screen and camera definitely go with the oneX, you will regret you didn't go with it when you see one in comparison with the S3!If you are a media fanatic who needs a lot of space, the the OneX isn't for u, the S3 is as good as a phone, even with a lower screen but with extra micro SD card slot. Also if you like to impress your friends, the little Samsung motions are certainly impressive and fun to use and the overall look may be a bit better.WHAT DID I DO?I missed how great the OneX screen was, I certainly missed how awesome HD vids looked on the screen, also I missed the slightly better camera, so I gladly paid the $35 restocking fee for at&t; and again returned back to the OneX, black this time since the white one caught stains fairly easily and had to be cleaned from time to time! I sold the at&t; over eBay and bought the unlocked international version with 32 GB built in memory, which was a bit more expensive but was definitely worth it!",5.0,1347321600,"09 11, 2012",HTC One X with Beats Audio Unlocked GSM Android SmartPhone - No Warranty - White,237.8,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZkTOME3kL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2400},HTC,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0

B0078LXM40,A1MFVAHTT2BHM0,J. Wang,"[0, 0]","I ordered this phone because I was going to be going overseas for several months, and wanted to have a phone that I could use anywhere in the world. The International version of the HTC One X, while offering better hardware configurations, fit very well. I use T-Mobile while in the US, and with the new tower integration, I am able to receive 3G speeds within the Seattle area.Additionally, I have been able to use microSIM cards from SMART in the Philippines, as well as other providers in Taiwan and Singapore.The phone is powerful. It's slim, and while it's a plastic phone, the plastic is high quality and very sleek. (Warning- don't drop it!) The screen is incredibly bright, and while it has Gorilla Glass, people seem to say that the quality in this department is iffy, some are indestructible, others get scratched by merely looking at the screen with an ugly thought. So I've been using a Skinomi screen protector, which has done the job relatively decently (but with the usual characteristics, fraying at the edges, yellowing tint, etc).My main gripe about the phone is that the camera lens sticks out the back, and the glass cover is prone to scratches. The glass is not gorilla glass but merely a high impact glass, which is easily scratched. I have a rather ugly slash that if it were a tiny bit more to the side, would have interfered with the sensor while taking photos. This is a huge issue for such a great phone.Secondly, the battery life is abysmal. With my mobile data on, my phone after 10 hours of use has dropped into a dangerously low 25-30% charge. Using wifi, my phone also results with the same charge. If you do not have them activated, the phone of course will behave like any other phone, hardly taking up any juice. But I've had to purchase an external battery charger in the case I'm out for the day. It's a bit annoying, though I know all smartphones currently have this issue.All in all, the phone is great. I paid a huge price for mine since I bought it early, but now the prices have fallen to the point where it's worth taking a look at these phones. Even if they're 'old news', they're still extremely powerful and can handle pretty much anything still out currently.",4.0,1356393600,"12 25, 2012",HTC One X with Beats Audio Unlocked GSM Android SmartPhone - No Warranty - White,237.8,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZkTOME3kL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2400},HTC,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0

The screen is a high resolution beauty and the screen seems to be tough as nails.  I've carried the phone in my pocket for six months and not a scratch. A few weeks ago ATT finally rolled out the Jelly Bean update that the phone is even better with the UI becoming much smoother and the few problems with HTC Sense crashing seem to have been fixed. All the apps I've installed run great.  The camera is decent in lighted spaces and the built in flash is handy. The touch buttons at the bottom of the screen are easier to use than physical buttons like the iPhones have.Some things I would like to see improved:  Camera low-light performance is horrible.  In warm-lighted rooms everything becomes orange and the built-in lighting correction does very little. The battery life is poor compared to an iPhone. The external speaker is hard to hear and the Beats audio seems little more than a branding gimmick. The Beats audio on my HP notebook is a noticeable improvement.

B0079Q67IC,A2AZG70U6VI4Y7,Rocman,"[14, 15]","I purchased this battery as an unofficial upgrade for my HTC Thunderbolt, which came with a woefully less-than-adequate OEM battery.  I can 100% confirm that this OEM battery for Rezound fits perfectly inside the HTC Thunderbolt with stock battery cover.  This was a big deal for me - the Thunderbolt was already a thick phone, and I could not stand the idea of additional bulk from an extended battery.Nominally, this Rezound battery has about 15% higher capacity (1620mah) versus the Thunderbolt's (1400mah).  There was a VERY noticeable improvement in battery life just on the first charge cycle with this new battery in my Thunderbolt.  I am actually able to leave 4G on and still go through a day!  This was incredible compared to the Thunderbolt's OEM battery, which barely lasts me through the morning.  Granted, the Thunderbolt battery is about a year old at this point.  But still, I do not remember this type of performance ever with this phone until now.For $10 + $2 shipping, this is an awesome deal.  This is a sizable discount from purchasing from Verizon, even with my corporate discount.The shipping was quick, and the battery was inside a sealed plastic bag inside a padded envelope that was labelled specifically for lithium ion battery shipment.  It was shipped via USPS with tracking.  I compared it to another line in the family that has the Rezound, and the battery looks identical (except for the serial number of course).  Overall, a very pleasant experience.If you're reading this and you own a Thunderbolt, don't waste another second.  Buy this now - it's a must have upgrade!  This is the battery the Thunderbolt SHOULD have been shipped with in the first place.[Jan 2013 Update]I upgraded from my trusty Thunderbolt to a HTC Rezound in 9/12. The OEM battery from Amazon has continued to work flawlessly with the new phone, which is to be expected since it's the actual phone that the battery's designed for. After about 6 months of using both this OEM battery from Amazon and the original battery that came with my new Rezound, I can confirm that they have comparable performance, and that my original recommendation still stands. I will be writing a comprehensive review for the Rezound soon, but I want to quickly mention that this spare battery really alleviates the one single flaw with the phone - battery life. By throwing it into my backpack or coat pocket, I essentially have 3200 mah of battery capacity available for my Rezound.  This is roughly equal to the capacity of that deliciously massive internal battery in the Motorola Razr Maxx.  Yes, there is additional hassle of switching out the used battery for a new one, and you have to remember to charge both batteries, but it's largely made the battery life concern a non-issue.[Jan 6, 2014 Update]The battery is still working well. Using GSAM and battery monitor widget, the battery capacity is around 1470mah. This gives a loss of about 150mah, or about 9.26%, over about 1.5 years of daily usage.

B007P7JF52,A2Z9S2RQD542CP,Irineo Placido-Lopez,"[29, 33]","Alright everyone, this is a review on the HTC EVO 3D, one of my favorite phones aside from the iPhone from Apple. The Htc Evo 3D is a great phone that is perfect for anyone who wants a really nice phone. Now for the main review...The Display:The display on the Evo 3D is great on its 4.3 inch LCD screen. With a 540 x 960 qHD 3D Display its screen looks really nice. I posted some pictures of the phone's screen, flash, and text sharpness. Feel free to check those out to get an idea of how nice the screen of this phone looks. Note that this display looks great, but it can't compare to Apple's Retina Display.The Battery:With a rechargeable 1730 mAh Battery the battery life on the Evo 3D is O.K. It will last you an entire day with some occasional uses throughout the day. If you use the phone a lot you will have to recharge it again at least once throughout the day.The Camera:The phone has a 5 Mega Pixel Camera that is capable of taking some really nice photos in both normal and in 3D. The 3D does tend to hurt/bother the eyes from the people that I have asked. It does look nice, but if you are watching a movie/slide show in 3D you will probably have to take a break from the 3D to avoid bothering the eyes.Now when you first get the phone it is going to be running Android 2.3 (Gingerbread), you will have to update it various times in order to get the latest Android version. After you update your phone completely it will be running Android 4.03 (Ice Cream Sandwich). With the New Update come new looks to the phone. It also will upgrade to the new Google Play Store instead of the old Android Market. There are tons of new things in the Google Play store that the old version of Android did not have.Overall: If you want a good looking phone that takes amazing pictures in both regular and in 3D. This is a really nice phone. The battery life could be better, but considering it's a smart phone it is O.K. I would rate this 5 stars out of 5 stars.",5.0,1345075200,"08 16, 2012",HTC EVO 3D No Contract Sprint Cell Phone,109.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41gBPohZlCL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 13465},HTC,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0

B00BJL133C,A26P08DCAHSM77,Genryu,"[7, 10]","I began following the HTC since it was first getting leaked that HTC was staging a comeback, and the HTC One was going to be their flagship device. I'm someone that always likes to jump on board with the latest and greatest and so I tried out the HTC One shortly after it came out. Despite my initial excitement and some positive aspects to the device and the software, I ultimately ended up returning it. I've tried to highlight the pros and cons below that led to my decision.Pros- Fantastic build quality: This is what an Android phone should be built like and it just feels fantastic to the touch. High quality materials all around - save for a few bands of plastic for the cellular and Wifi radios. Holding this in 1 hand and the SGS4 in the other makes it readily apparent which company went the extra mile to build something that feels solid in the hand.- Excellent screen: The color reproduction is by far the more accurate out of the recent crop of android devices on the market. I regularly use a color-calibration device on my computer monitors, so I pay particular attention to this. The unit I specifically got has a slight red-shift, but nothing that impairs the overall quality. It's definitely got more accurate color reproduction than the Samsung Galaxy S4, but some people might like the ""richer"" more saturated look that the SGS4 provides. Viewing angles are only about okay, but not a big issue for me since I'm the only one that uses this. The 1080p Resolution makes everything crisp and easy to read.- Above-average low-light performance: This phone overall does a better job than most other competitors in terms of low-light performance. I wish I could say it stands above the rest, but Nokia takes top honors in low-light and in terms of mixed lighting scenarios I still think the SGS4 is still a step up. See the cons for more information.- Good camera software: The Zoes feature is pretty cool and is a great way to create little clips or pick out the best image of the lot. It's easy to share and integrates well with existing social networks. It's one of the unique software features HTC offers, and is definitely one of the fun highlights that most people I show really enjoy playing with. I just wish it came with a dedicated camera button to make taking pictures a bit easier.- Great built-in speakers: The speakers that are built into the phone sound pretty solid if you're holding the phone in the standard portrait mode. It's great for sharing something with a friend when you're in a more public area and most phone speakers give out. Don't expect miracles from phone speakers, but as far as phone speakers go they are a step above the rest. The beats software also does some great synthesizer work when you plug in your headphones, though it's more suitable for current pop and hip-hop music than for other genres.- Blinkfeed: Blinkfeed sort of integrates all of the news you care about into one convenient sliding panel. I tried it for a bit, and while it's convenient I also feel it was reducing my battery performance (no evidence of this), so I simply chose to ignore it. It's a great option for those of you that want to pull in information from all of your favorite sites into one area. I don't think there is a way to remove blinkfeed entirely, you can only choose to ignore it like I did. Still work trying out though!- Includes IR integration: This means the HTC can connect and control your TV, which is pretty handy when you can't find the remote. It's pretty basic in terms of the controls you get, but it works well in a pinch.- Solid wifi performance: I have a Asus AC-1750 802.11ac router and tested speeds on file transfers and media playback with the HTC One and it came through with flying colors. I was easily able to transfer a 1080p MKV movie file of around a few gigs in size in minute or 2. It's not as quick as the external 802.11ac adapters I have, but excellent for a phone.Cons- The metal build of this phone means that if it gets dropped it will definitely show some serious battle-scars, paint chipping, and dents. The SGS4, though plastic, does have durability going for it. It's a shame to feel like you have to invest in a case since it's such a good looking device, but I just don't feel safe about using this phone outside without one because it's so easy for someone to bump you accidentally and for this phone to get thrashed. The metal also means this thing heats up quite a bit when you're doing things like watching movies/tv or playing a game.- Camera is just not that great overall: The camera integrates what HTC is calling ultra-pixels, which are basically a smaller number of bigger pixels to capture more light. While this is a fine solution to capture more light and give you better low-light performance, it's not the best choice for when you do have plenty of light or even moderate light. Frankly, I just didn't think the images were that great, and the lack of zoom while working with them on your desktop becomes readily apparent - especially if you like to crop your shots after taking them like I do. I personally think Nokia's implementation of using a ridiculously large megapixel sensor and combining multiple pixels to oversample is the better solution. Take a look at the new Nokia 1020 sample images and compare to see for yourself. If I had to buy a Android phone today and wanted the best overall camera - my nod goes to the SGS4.- Average battery life: While the capacity seems decent for a phone, because of the higher resolution and larger screen I've been seeing very average to poor battery life results. I've used it mainly on my daily commute, which involves listening to Pandora to and from work, checking gmail very regularly throughout the day, and using the calendar and GPS functions frequently. I do watch a tv show during the afternoon sometimes if I'm on the go, and make about a hour or 2 worth of phone calls a day. Put simply, I've bought a external battery pack and a spare charger with me everyday that I had this phone because if I wanted to go out after work I could not trust the HTC One to make it through. Every HTC device I've tried has had middling battery life, from the HTC Sensation to the HTC One X. It seems HTC hasn't changed much here, and it's a shame because the battery is sealed in, so I'm not at all confident about battery degradation over time.- No expandable storage: The 32gb that's built into this phone, with a fair amount used up for the HTC software, just isn't enough for power users. I load on a good deal of my own music and I used to just swap out movies and tv shows onto a microSD card slot to take on the go (thanks to data caps ruining the fun of streaming them on the go). I think 32gb will be fine for most people, but not having the option to expand like the SGS4 or Sony models just puts HTC one step below.- Still some lag: This phone has some really fast internals, and does indeed run very smoothly most of the time. Unfortunately, there are still those moments of slow-down and lag that have plagued Android handsets for a while that I at least still notice. This isn't going to be a 100% smooth experience, but it's not enough to severely impact the daily use of this phone. Just wanted to mention that it still is there for those of you that care.- Poor button placement: The power button is along the top part of the phone because it's integrated with the IR blaster, meaning it can be pretty hard to reach for those with smaller hands. Moreover, HTC decided to break the Android standard and include only the back and home button with a big non-functional htc logo in the middle. I can't tell you how many times I've pushed the logo expecting to go home, and this is something my friends have done too when playing with the phone. It's just a poor design decision.Ultimately for me the most important aspects of a phone are camera performance, screen quality, and battery life. In terms of camera-performance the HTC One is just not as good as the competition, and I cannot recommend buying it for the ultra-pixel (4MP) camera when there are better options available today and coming out soon. Screen quality on this phone is probably the best you can get in nearly all regards. And the battery-life is just something that on day-1 isn't good enough for me on what I consider moderate usage. Overall, if I had to own this phone for a few years, I wouldn't feel too happy about it. While the screen quality will hold up over time, the camera performance is already behind the competition and the battery life will only get worse as the battery degrades over time. I'm glad HTC is staging a comeback and this is a great first-step, but it's still got some work to do before I can recommend their devices for long-term ownership and satisfaction.",3.0,1374710400,"07 25, 2013",HTC ONE M7 32GB 4G LTE Android Smartphone (Unlocked) - Sliver,418.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51OD4eeWeeL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3933},HTC,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0

Lawrence,"[21, 24]","SPECS:1.7 GHz Snapdragon 600 with 4 x Krait 300 CPU and Adreno 320 GPU2GB of LPDDR2 with your choice of 32/64 GB NAND(Internal Storage)in your choice of Silver or Black.4.7"" SLCD3 1080p with a blazing 468 ppi which is the best on the market.4 MP camera but HTC uses Ultrapixel technology which allows for 300% more light for better pictures.2300 mah batteryAndroid 4.1.2 and they use Sense 5It has all the latest WiFi 802.11ad/a/b/g/n+ BT 4.0, USB 2.0, GPS/GNSS, MHL, DLNA, and NFCDual front facing speakers, HDR microhpones and 2.55V headphone amplifierHARDWARE:Let's be honest, the first thing you will notice when you see this phone or any phone, is how nice it looks and this phone does not disappoint, it has a beautiful industrial design and aesthetics, and just oozes beauty.  We use our phones so much that they have become an extension of us and the way it looks and feels in your hand is very important and the quality of the material is important and this phone does not let you down.  The finish and feel of the phone in my hand is phenomenal.  It's just one sexy looking device, and a nice welcome change from the typical plastic phone.  You can really tell that HTC focused on the looks and feel of this phone.From watching the HTC press conference when they phone was showcased it takes HTC 200 minutes to finish the chassis of the phone.  It is made from one solid piece of aluminum(except the front speakers, they are aluminum also but are snapped on) and when the insides are added the phone is sealed and they inject plastic between the cuts where they place the antenna so there is no issues with receiving any signal like other metal phones and like the iPhone use to have.  This also necessary so you can utilize NFC.  HTC calls this their zero gap construction which they state has not gaps between aluminum and the polymer of the body.  However there are some small gaps on the top and bottom where the speakers are put on, but not on the bottom.  I give them tons of credit, because this is the first Android phone that can finally match the build of the iPhone which I have always liked the looks of the iPhone but have never been a fan of iOS.The back of the phone has a nice curve and feels amazing in the hand.  It just fits perfectly and has a nice cool feel to the phone.  The back has a microphone that will help with noise cancellation.  HTC will not come out and say what the whole composition of the phone is, and I can't say that I blame them.  The One has absolutely not creaking or flexing which is quite nice.  My S3 and S2 would sometime creak because of the plastic but on the One they use such a high quality build material that you do not have to worry about it, which is a nice welcome feeling.  If HTC would have stopped there that would have been ok, but to make the phone even more beautiful they take a diamond drill to the sides and back corners to give the phone chamfered edges which makes this high end device really shine.On the front of the phone HTC has decided to go with 2 buttons instead of 3 like we see on most handsets or on screen buttons.  Some people will love it or hate it, but after a few days I have found no issues with it but it would have been nice to allow you to use the HTC logo at the bottom as another button such as the home button or even awaking the screen.  It appears to me that HTC really put in time and effort to make this device more user friendly and less confusing.  One of the things you always hear from the iPhone crowd is Android can be somewhat overwhelming even though it has the better software and definitely more customization than iOS and Windows.  It's obvious that they are targeting the iPhone crowd.  You can still do everything you need to with 2 buttons, for example you double tap the home button and the multitask comes up.  HTC eliminated the home button which is what Google likes.BATTERY LIFE:I have been using this phone for over a week and have not had any issues with battery life.  Since the phone uses a all aluminum body you can not switch the battery out.  Some may have an issues with this, I do not.  With my S3 I could switch the battery out but I never really did so.  HTC also has added a powersave mode which you can use to help keep battery life in check and I have used this setting and not noticed any drop in performance.  When you implement this mode you can customize it to fit your needs such as under clocking the CPU, dimming your screen, and stopping auto sync.  The CPU, display, and Auto sync will be the 3 of the biggest battery killers, so that is the setting I use when I implement it.  I also recommend using the slider to adjust your display because it is typically much higher than it needs to be.HTC went with a 2300 mAh battery, but it would have been a welcomed improvement if they would have went with a 2600 to 2800 mAh battery.  The new Samsung S4 has a 2600 mAh battery and from the reviews I have read they have almost the same battery life.  In some tests I've seen and ran the HTC One squeezed out an extra hr or so of use on WiFi for web browsing.  Of course there are numerous factors that determine this such as the number of apps your are running, what you have syncing and one of the biggest is how strong of a signal your phone is getting.  My house is located in a horrible coverage area for 3g and my S3 would suffer till I was able to get a Airave from Sprint which taps into my home WiFi creating a mini cell phone tower in my house and definitely has helped improve battery life.  Your phone constantly searching for 3g and/or a WiFi signal is a huge battery drain, so make sure you cut WiFi off when not in use.HTC has done a great job improving battery life with their updated Sense 5.  My original HTC Evo 4G had horrible battery life and could barely go 4 hrs before the phone would die.  You should be able to get 8+ hours of web browsing before you have to plug your phone in if your on WiFi, if your own 3g depending on your signal you will get around 6 hrs.  For cellular talk time you will get over 14 hrs which is the best I have seen other than the Droid Razr Maxx with it's massive battery.  Bottom line is you should be able to make it through the day before having to charge your device.I have heard from some HTC One users that it takes them about 3 1/2 to 4 hrs to charge their devices, but mine doesn't seem to take this long, however I normally don't have to plug my phone in till I go to bed.  I believe the reason for this is since the battery is not replaceable HTC wants to make sure the device will last for many many years, because if the battery should go out like some previous ones made by HTC this phone is not repairable because of the sealed aluminum body and they will pretty much have to send you a new device which could get pretty expensive.From what I've been told and read it takes about 3 hours to get to around 90% and the last 10% takes the additional hr to get to a full charge, but like I stated earlier, I typically don't have to plug my phone in till i'm ready for bed, so this has not been an issue for me.CAMERA:As I stated in the specs above, HTC decided to avoid the mega pixel war and shake some things up and went with a 4MP.  HTC seemed to do the opposite of Samsung which is throw everything in but the kitchen sink even though it might not be useful or quite ready for prime time and focus on 3 or 4 really great things that people use on a daily basis such as the camera.  Most people believe the higher the mega pixel the better the camera or picture will be and this is not true, unless you are taking your pictures and blowing them up to 20 ft.  What determines the quality of the picture is the sensor  and the sensor used by HTC allows 300% more light to come through allowing for the best pictures I have seen on a camera in low light and indoor situations which is where most pictures are taken.  HTC has decided to call this Ultrapixels.  Outside the pictures are good, but nowhere near as good as low light situations.  However there are tons of feature and settings you can tweak to improve this, and HTC knows about this and is currently rolling out an update for the International One over the next week, so it's only a matter of time before this hits the US market and from the before and after picks I have seen it is night and day better.The front camera is 2.1 mp.  I also found the video recording performance to be excellent also, and there are tons of tweaks HTC did with Zoe being the best one and and wonderfully implemented highlight reel.  Basically what Zoe is video plus still images.  It will record 3 seconds of video with 20 full resolution images taken in 1080P and starts before you hit the camera button and a little after you take the picture to make sure you get the right shot.  How many times have you went for the perfect pic of your child doing something to miss it, with Zoe, that will be much harder to do.DISPLAY:As stated in the specs this beauty boasts a 4.7"" 1080p LCD display with the highest pixel density(PPI) I have seen at 468, which is higher than the Retina display on the iPhone 5 and the new Samsung S4.  This display has the highest contrast ration I have seen and an amazing brightness level for deep blacks and and bright whites.  One of the amazing things about this display is you will no longer struggle to use your phone outdoors as this display can get very bright, something my S3 struggled with and the S4 with it's much imporved AMOLED display sill struggles with.PROCESSOR:Snapdragon 600 is the best processor out for a phone right now and is the same one used in the Samsung Galaxy S4.  Qualcomm has made a 800 processor however, it will be a while before we see them in a phone in the US, even though there are several phones coming out in China that has this processor, but I feel it is overkill in a phone, and better suited for a Tablet.  The 600 also has an upgrade in the CPU cores from previous Snapdragon processor to a Krait 300 form a Krait 200 and Adreno 320 GPU.  From everything I have seen, this is a nice upgrade.  Without getting to complicated with numbers teh Krait 300 deals with memory bandwidth.  Qualcomm says a increase of 15% in CPU performance at the same frequency rate for the prior Krait.I ran several benchmark tests and the HTC One came out on top and went back and forth with the Samsung S4, sometimes the One would win, and sometimes the S4 would win.  I'm not posting numbers because they do not always translate to real world use.  I can tell you the One flies and can handle any task or game you throw at it.  It has 0 lag and is very fast and fluid.SOFTWARE:HTC One uses Sense 5 which is the best UI I have used on a phone outside of vanilla Android.  HTC did a great job and Sense 5 is a joy to use.  It's very polished and smooth and just looks elegant.  Compared to the Touch Wiz UI that Samsung uses which I find to be a little over the top and cartoonish.  Once again, you can tell that Sense 5 is a more polished software and looks great.  Once again, I get the feeling that HTC is going after the iPhone crowd, and nothing is wrong with that.  It's a joy to use.  With Sense 5 you no longer have the cartoony round edges and they have moved to a flat more modern style.  Their is a learning curve inside the launcher, but after playing with it, I believe you will be ok.One of the major changes in Sense 5 is BlinkFeed and is your main home screen, but can be moved.  Some people will not like it, but I do, and don't understand the hate I have seen on some web sites.  If you don't like it, don't use it, and you can even download another launcher such as Apex or Nova and not look back.  Would have been nice if HTC allowed you to delete it, but, it will always be there.  I have not noticed a drain on the battery because you can customize it to only update over WiFI and only on 3g when you update it. I find myself using it because we find ourselves living in a very fast paced world where we don't always have long amounts of time so instead of opening up one app for facebook and reading it, then oppening up twitter and reading that, they launching an app for the news or going into your web browser, BlinkFeed pulls all of it together in one easy to read location that is very customizable.  You can have it show your social feeds and news feeds, or just the main highlights, or say you just want news, you can do that too.HTC also included a IR blaster that doubles as the on/off button on the top left.  This is one of the few knocks I have on the device because it's flush with the top and can sometimes be difficult to hit and almost impossible if holding in one hand unless your a NBA basketball player.  I have gotten somewhat use to it now, but still sometimes go to find it on the side above the volume rocker and realize it's not there.  The IR blaster is a nice touch and allows you to control your TV, cable/Sat box and home entertainment system with your phone.  The set up is super easy and it walks you through the steps in minutes.  I have used it, and it's a nice touch.STORAGE:HTC One comes in 2 models, the 32GB and 64GB models with AT&T; currently having the exclusive for now on the 64GB model.  The HTC One does not have a spot for a microSD card which is not a big deal for me and Google wants to get away from them for security issues and to make it less confusing for non tech customers who might get confused where their songs are and pictures are stored. Since you can't add apps to your SDcard anyway it only serves a purpose for storing pictures, movies, and music, but with everyone moving to the cloud it's a non issue, but with 32GB you can store a bunch of entertaininent on your device if you choose to.  Another thing to keep in mind is that HTC allows USBOTG support, so you can attach a thumb drive and get more storage if you like, or just store stuff in the cloud.  I use my Nexus 7 for movie watching andstore everything on there.SPEAKERS:HTC still has their partnership with beatsaudio and it does have the branding on the back of the phone and does make a great improvement in sound quality.  HTC has put dual front stereo speakers on the front of the phone and the sound will blow you away.  You will no longer struggle to listen to music, playing games, watching movies, or the latest YouTube videos, and no more having to cup your hands on the back of the device to try and hear it.  This needs to be a staple of every phone from here on out and is a reason to buy this phone.  The One hands down has the best speakers on any cell phone on the market and more importantly it's not just loud, the clarity is there.  HTC calls this BoomSound and they work great on speakerphone also and no more missing phone calls because you couldn't hear your phone ringing.  The call quality is excellent on this device and I have no issues hearing anyone and everyone I spoke to said I came through crystal clear.  I also need to mention that this device comes with a wonderful pair of headphones.  They are not labeled beats, but they sure sound amazing.  The bass is really tight and the mids and highs come in very good.  Definately one of the better pair of earbuds I have received with a phone and if I walked into a store and paid $99 for them I would be happy with my purchase.SUMMARY:The HTC one is hands down the best phone I have ever owned or used and I highly recommend it.  I get asked all the time what phone am I using and people are in awe over the device when I show them.  HTC took a risk on this phone and I believe it paid off.  So many pros about this device from the amazing screen, front facing stereo speakers and all metal body in the perfect package and size that just fits in your hand so naturally and they managed to keep it light but not so light that it feels cheap.  It looks like and is a premium handset and the first Android phone that can challenge the iPhone for best looking phone.  Android always has better specs than the iPhone but now they have the body to match.",5.0,1366848000,"04 25, 2013",HTC ONE M7 32GB 4G LTE Android Smartphone (Unlocked) - Sliver,418.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51OD4eeWeeL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3933},HTC,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0
B00BJL133C,A3VVMIMMTYQV5F,Johnny Saigon,"[357, 373]","What is there to say about this phone? If I just write about it, I'm just going to ramble on and on. So to save everyone some grief, here are bullet points (my direct comparisons are to the iPhone 5, Samsung Galaxy S3 and Note 2, but mainly to the Galaxy S4):The Good:1) THE SCREEN: If there was such a better screen on a phone, I have not yet seen it. The iPhone 5 is lauded for its excellent screen, but at its current resolution, it trails behind the One's screen by far. Everything just POPS out at you. Even in direct sunlight, everything is CLEAR and BRIGHT. I really loved the Droid DNA/HTC Butterfly's screen, but once again HTC has outdone itself and given us a true masterpiece in 4.7"" 1080p(468ppi) form. This is THE BEST screen on the planet right now - WOW!!!2) THE DESIGN/HARDWARE: Why do most reviewers laud the iPhone 5's aluminum construction so much, when it chips and nicks so easily?? If you want a true masterpiece in design and craftsmanship, look no further. The One feels THICK and TOUGH. I don't have to worry about carrying this around case-less(except from drops, which is a whole other case). I will not be worried about this phone nicking and scraping like the iPhone 5. Personally, it may not have the flair of some of the Sony and Nokia phone of the past, but in totality the One has the best combination of design and craftsmanship. It oozes style and sophistication(*cough*Samsung*ahem*).3) THE DUAL FRONT-FACING SPEAKERS: We have all been desensitized to the modern smartphones nowadays with their crappy, tinny, mono speaker. I remember the days of the Nokia n95 and n84 with their stereo speakers - whatever happened to phones after that? Whoever agreed to a mono/solo speaker with all the smartphones thereafter?? FINALLY, someone has the senses to come back to reality - thank you, HTC!. Trust me, your ears will thank you and you will realize all phones should have been made like this. Especially when you use ringtones/alerts that were specifically created for this phone, the sound is loud, immersive, expansive, and POPs into your ears. It's simply a re-revolution.4) THE CAMERA: I don't use my phone camera to make prints from photos, I have my dedicated cameras for that. So to me, the paramount function of phone cameras is the convenience/accessibility - it has to be able to capture what I want quickly and clearly, with decent enough quality to post online. Therefore, the 4MP size in the One's camera does not bother me at all. Who cares if the camera isn't THE BEST phone camera ever? Because it is not, but it is a GREAT low-light shooter, and to me that's more important than pixel count. The sensors in the camera are bigger than other phone cameras, therefore, it can capture a lot more light, which in laymen's terms it can give you better photos in more situations than other phone cameras can. Also, the touch spot focus is almost instantaneous - this camera is quick, quick, quick!5) For a near 5-incher, it's quite svelte, at least at the girth. It's easier to hold in the hand than the Samsung Galaxy S3/S4, and for sure a heckuva lot better than the Note 2. It fits in your hands nicely and securely, with just the right combination of size, weight, and balance.6) The UI and software design is now very minimal and simplistic. For better or for worse, if you are used to the old Sense UI's, you will need some readjusting. Personally, I like this new one better. If you're a casual news reader, then you'll like new default home screen which displays a gathering of news sources - some of its own partners, some for your Facebook and Twitter, etc. - to form a Flipboard style of news reader. Personally, I'm a huge Pulse news reader fan, so I only use that.The Bad and Ugly:1) The battery is only 2300mAh - I wish it was bigger because I'm one of those paranoid people who always needs my phone at fully charged, just in case, of you know, something. But so far it's been holding steady at about 40% at the end of the day(from 9am-6pm). I check emails, read the news, text, Facebook, etc. throughout the day - I would say that I'm a moderate to heavy user. Another bad thing that I've noticed is it charges slower than most other phones.2) Comparing features with the Samsung S4, the One is lacking. It's not a deal breaker, but for those who like fancy functions, the One will not make you as happy. The HTC One is very simple in its feature set. The one feature I miss most from the new Samsung phones is Smart Stay, where the phone can sense that you're looking at the screen, and won't dim/turn off the screen - that was a HUGE convenience for when you're watching a movie or reading the news.3) Like I wrote earlier, the size is both good and bad, and it's also heavier than most similar phones. It's taller than the S4, and with the power button up on top, it's almost impossible to do one-hand phone operations without shifting your hand up and down to accommodate both the screen gestures and buttons. The buttons(power and volume) don't protrude enough to make it easy to press them.All in all, I feel the combination of the One's screen, design/craftsmanship, and audio experience trumps over the Samsung S4's fancy functions. The S4's screen is almost just as good - AMOLED screens are known for their deep blacks and saturation, while the One's is much better in direct light. The S4 has a higher MP camera, therefore able to take better photos in broad daylight, while the One's camera is more versatile and MUCH better in low light conditions. The One has a much better audio experience, while the S4 gives you better convenience with its features - userability goes to the S4 for sure.But in the end, considering the totality of things, I feel the HTC One provides me the best TOTAL experience, and is the king of the smartphones right now.",5.0,1365379200,"04 8, 2013",HTC ONE M7 32GB 4G LTE Android Smartphone (Unlocked) - Sliver,418.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51OD4eeWeeL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3933},HTC,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0

B00BJL133C,A30HYKFL7ERFE7,Matt Turner,"[8, 8]","Just FYI, this review is tailored toward iPhone users, but hopefully can help other peeps as well!I am a long time iPhone user, having purchased my first in 2008 to complement my Mac computers.  The intentional hardware/software integration of Apple devices always worked well for me and pleased me, but my trusty old iPhone 4 was a brick compared to modern phones.  I was waiting until the release of the 5s to use my upgrade, and while I think the new iPhone is a great phone overall, I found myself with a yearning for something different after it came out.  A little bigger screen, a few more customization options, and I don't know...I just needed a little break from iOS, and there was nothing on the iPhone 5s I just HAD to have.  I like the iPhone.  I like Apple.  But I also like change.But most Android phones, for Apple devotees especially, just don't feel solid.  If you've never used an iPhone or a MacBook pro, maybe you can see past the hardware, but I simply couldn't get over the ""cheap"" feeling when holding a Samsung Galaxy S4 or Moto X.  I do realize they're good phones, but Apple spoils and seduces with its beautiful hardware, and I couldn't let go.  Moreover, Apple just has cleaner interfaces compared to most Android phones, which always felt a bit cluttered to me.While the Galaxy S4 is probably more widely believed to be the premier Android device at the moment, I kept running across mentions of the HTC One, which was held to be the S4's equal performance wise, and of a far higher design quality, perhaps even in the class of Apple products.  After reading review after review, and agonizing between the One and the iPhone 5s, I bit and bought my first non-Apple smartphone.  Give me credit, that was big step for a long term Apple guy!And I'm so glad I did!  This phone is, I believe, the aesthetic equal of the iPhone in terms of hardware, something I'd never run across before.  And in terms of software aesthetics, it blows other android operating systems away in terms of design and pleasure of use.  Yes...for an Apple guy, the inevitable bloatware (from AT&T;, especially) was obnoxious and just feels so wrong and unnecessary.  But it's also easy to ignore and delete, and I actually feel more pleasure using the HTC Sense layered Android of the HTC One than I did with iOS 7.  It's a bit more complicated, but also more upgradeable.  And the software just looks good, not as cluttered as other Android devices feel to a previous iOS user.  The hardware and software are seamlessly integrated, which for iPhone-types is a must.  The bright, sharp screen, the aluminum, the well-thought-out buttons...I'm very impressed.  Overall, if design - hardware OR software - is important to you and you are considering Android phone, this is by far the best device I've found.In terms of features, the Beats Audio is probably twice as loud as iPhone speakers, and the sound quality is good, given its a smartphone.  I like that the speakers are on the front, which gives you perceivable stereo audio when watching movies.  Compared with my iPhone 4, the camera is superb, though it actually only has 4 megapixels - which, I'm figuring out, is not the best way to judge a phone's camera quality.  You don't get the zoom detail like you do from other phones, no.  But the pictures are always bright and sharp, the shutter is instantaneous, and the low-light pictures are absolutely wonderful (which is why the lower MP count was intentionally used).  Finally, the front-facing camera - if you're into selfies - is one of the best on any phone.  And having switched from iPhone, the whole lack of removable storage thing - a gripe from some reviewers - seems silly.The HTC one does not have ALL the features of the S4.  However, it has higher quality in the features one actually uses.  That's way more important, to me at least.Performance wise, the phone is snappy as could be.  Even though it came out earlier than some of its main competitors, it maintains some of the highest speed and power specs in the market.  The 4G is blazing fast, and the wifi connects seamlessly.If you do switch from iPhone and run Mac computers, you will notice that the device does not sync as seamlessly as iPhones.  Sorry, Android aficionados, its just a fact - there's no argument to be made.  The automation simply isn't there.  And I never had to download third party apps to sync with an iPhone.  Speaking of which I highly recommend AirDroid, which was the easiest to use sync app for the HTC One.  Another peeve after switching was that my DRM-protected (older) iTunes downloads couldn't be transferred to the HTC One until I did some finagling.  And switching to Google cloud services (calendar, picture storage, reminders, etc.) instead of iCloud from Apple does take a bit of getting used to.But I had everything working with no hiccups with just a couple of hours of work.  To me, it was totally worth it.  There's a learning curve with any change.So here's my recommendation:For iPhone users who like change and just want to try something new, this phone will please you over and over again. For Android users, ditch the clutter and plastic and get a phone that will make you feel something.  Get the HTC One, I absolutely love it.",5.0,1380412800,"09 29, 2013",HTC ONE M7 32GB 4G LTE Android Smartphone (Unlocked) - Sliver,418.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51OD4eeWeeL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3933},HTC,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0
B00BJL133C,A3BM7G85F9YSLV,MP,"[12, 13]","APRIL 29, 2013:  I have had my One for 11 days and the experience has been great.  A beautiful device that you can show on your work desk.  Priot to getting it, my major concerns were not having a replaceable battery or M-SD card slot but have found out that was not necessary.  Phone's call quality is great, the front facing speakers are superb, allowing a true stereo effect and the display has been surprisingly good even outside in sunny days.  Perhaps, one of the things I like the most is the level of customization w/o using Carrier's applications or those from third parties.  Sense and blink are new to me but were customized also to my likes.  The camera has some innovative features which I have tried but is something I am not interested in a cell phone.Have been conducting some ""home tests"" on battery life and noticed that per the phone's battery indicator, its consumption might not be linear; it shows that most of the charge is used during the first few hours and below 50% takes more time to be consumed.  Nevertheless, downloaded today a couple of applications to monitor which applications are most important regarding battery use.  BTW, with average use making phone calls, text messaging, accessing e-mails and web browsing, have been charging the phone every 36 to 48 hours (similar to the Droid X).  I am not into social media or extreme texting.Worth mentioning that changing from my three year old Moto-Droid meant switching from VZN to ATT but still in the 14 day return period.  ATT's signal is not as good as Big Red but so far has worked for me (except when in underground places).  I have no objective elements to compare the One to the S-4 as have always considered Sammy's phones ""boring"", too wide and cheap looking; phones not for me.  The HTC One looks very well made and the combination of aluminum with glass and black background on the screen makes it very attractive for all those that have not seen the device in person.  So far is a ""keeper"" and if you have one, experiment customizing it, a really fun experience.May 12, 2013:  I have been using my HTC One for three weeks and writing article this as a follow up to the first review published on 04/29/13.  Overall the device has been flawless although the ATT signal is not as good as the one from VZN.  My One is a silver 64GB phone that was preordered and even arrived before the expected date.  After having used a Droid X (with VZN) for three years my major concern on getting the One was the non replaceable battery.  Probably I am one of the few users who have a spare charged battery for all portable devices as live in a hurricane prone area and in 2005 (due to Hurricane Wilma) was without communication for over a week.The One's 2,300 mAh battery has been surprisingly good.  I am not into Facebook or other social media and use the device as a Telephone, for MM messages, for Text Messaging, for E-Mails and the Sense feature is always looked at and many articles read (a really nice feature).  Occasionally can watch a video or take photos but does not happen every day.  Regarding the phone's settings, the Power Saver and Sleep mode are on as well as the Mobile data and the Bluetooth.  Wi-Fi is off as have other devices that I use on said mode and the current contract w ATT allows plenty of data.  So far the battery use has been as follows:* Moderate Use:  1 day 11 hours consumed 51% of the battery.  For me, Moderate use is 10-15 calls, 10 messages, Internet searching, Sense news and 10-12 photos.* Light use:  3 days 12 hours used 75% of the battery life.  Light use for me is 4-6 calls, 10 messages, Internet searching, Sense news and 3-4 photos.* Heavy use:  3 days 5 hours have taken 83% of the battery life.  This means calling everyone on Mother's Day (20+ calls) 4-6 messages, Internet, Sense and two photos.Having stated the above ratings, the HTC battery lasts much longer that what I had anticipated.  BTW, I am in an ATT 4-G area with excellent phone reception and most of the time with Bluetooth devices.  I charge the phone every other day or every third day and no power problems as of now.  Of all the great features of the device, my biggest surprise has been the battery duration.  And being 2013, so many awesome phones do not have a replaceable battery, such as the Nokias 920/928, some of the new VZN Androids and not to mention the Apple products which date from 2007 w/o a replaceable battery.  Nevertheless, there are many alternatives to supplement power on these devices by external sources by simply a common micro USB connection (available anywhere) or even from your car's charger or even the computer.I was recently reading some reviews on the 16GB Sammy S-4 and seem they are having issues with the native storage capacity, especially w the 16GB version.  The OS and Native applications do not allow users much storage.  I was intrigued by this issue and looked up my phone DCIM source and with all the apps, ringtones & photos I have customized, these take less than 5GBs of the 64 that the phone natively have.  But I have just one movie and not songs/albums playlists.And lastly, a recent controversy has been published as the One has not been updated from the Android 4.1 to the 4.2 platform.  Having verified both of these, it might be useless as the One performs great and the newest version on the S-4  has some gimmicks that may look fine but will be useless for most users.News have been published that now VZN is planning to have the One after they had declined it because of their homologue DNA.  But my dearest friends from Big Red, it is kind of late...  Many users such as me, switched the amazing VZN coverage for ATT because you decided on not having the latest fashionably and optimal device.  This happened with the Nokia 920 last year and with the infamous Apple products several years ago.  Perhaps is time for the Big Red guys to re-evaluate marketing strategies.  Good luck with that!

B00BJL133C,A3R19OX24R49WT,N.Yorker,"[92, 102]","2012 was the year of the smartphone for 3 big companies: Apple, Samsung and Google. The iphone 5 was about the best looking phone ever made with a solid operating system and excellent support. The Galaxy 3 stole the spotlight with terrific commercials and a solid contender with Apple. And Google released the best phone, in my humble opinion, ever made until that point. The nexus 4 was and is cheap for just $300, receives upgrades from google directly, and is quite simply a stunner. Last year, however, the HTC One X was also released if you didn't know, and it was second best only to the Nexus 4. It had a terrific screen, great build quality even though it was plastic, and it was just a thin slab of sexiness that slid into your pocket easily with the best camera of all phones mentioned above. Yet, nobody knew about it.This year, it seems people are hearing about HTC, and Apple and Samsung will have to fight one more company to take the spot of best smartphone. In my view they failed last year as google offered a phone that was for the first time the best mobile experience ever put on the palms of your hands.This year, the HTC One has taken that place from google. The HTC One is quite simply stunning in and out. First thing I did was put an invisible shield to prevent any scratches and keep its metal body ever intact (something I do to all my phones since I don't use a case, and more importantly, I never drop these guys).Design:Google took the experience from apple, but apple kept the design hat. This year HTC takes the design to a whole new level. No phone ever looked this good. It's just the right amount of heavy to make it solid, the right amount of curvature to sit on the palm of your hand, and the right amount of beauty and industrial design. The word Stunning can't be used enough here. The speakers are obviously for audio, but they simply add to the art in a way no other phone has done before. It's a work of industrial art that puts every iPhone model to shame.Experience:Matches the iPhone point by point and offers MORE. Home screens, Facebook integration, widgets, and a whole new home screen where you get news and all of your social information in one place. For those of you who use flipboard heavily as I do, it's the same great interface to give you just the right amount of news whenever you need it. As a news junkie, it's ever appreciated. If you don't need it, just ignore it to the side. But it doesn't hurt to have Facebook set up so you can easily see what's happening in your social circles. Within 1 minute of set up, I had close to 52GB of music available to stream and save from google play music (a free service BTW on every android phone), within 10 minutes I paid my bill at Duane Read using the phone as a wallet, and within 30 minutes I had taken the best shot I have ever taken with a mobile phone.The user interface for those who don't know is Sense. Sense 5? Maybe? It's fast, capable of handling widgets as well as google's unadulterated vanilla android on the Nexus 4, and is quite simple. But don't mistake that for a lack of options like the iPhone's simplicity. It is still android and all the options are there. It outdoes Samsung's touchwiz, and apple's outdated IOS which is obviously the same interface from 2007. I like this as much as the vanilla android on the nexus 4, and like it even more due to blinkfeed. The only thing I miss is the ability to add lockscreen apps, but that's coming soon (we hope).A good part of the user experience is UPDATES. Apple and google own this sector with outstanding updates. Google more so since their updates are actually useful. HTC plainly sucks. Here is hoping they will update the heck out of this phone, and force carriers, especially ATT to push out updates. Don't let this be another htc one x where we wait 7 months for a released update. If not, support carrier versions and push out updates themselves. Give me a link and let me download and install updates without my carrier. Or is that contractually not possible?Screen:Best screen on any phone. 1080P. It rules them all, and outdoes the HTC One X from last year. This is the whole phone experience, and having this kind of a screen just makes the phone a pleasure to use. Comparing this screen with the iPhone 5 just shows how much apple needs a larger screen more than ever. It is simply impossible for me to use my iphone after using the HTC One as you feel absolutely constrained when reading webpages, looking at pictures, etc. Puts last year's Samsung S3 to shame. It's quite a stark difference.Camera:The camera here is a fantastic shooter. Don't be alarmed at the 4MP factor. The images have terrific resolution, excellent color, and fantastic low light resolution. What worries most buyers is the detail presence  due to 4MP, and if you're planning to print out huge posters, then this is not the camera to be used. If you want memories, at any time of the day, recorded with great clarity, then this camera offers the best balance between light resolution and detail possible right now (in a smartphone that is), especially if you have an active night life. The resolution and clarity of night pictures is just, again, Stunning.Speakers:I wasn't as blown away by the speakers as others were. They are the loudest speakers of any phone or tablet I've tried most certainly, but I'm waiting for the day when the backside of a phone will be a massive speaker that truly reproduces music similar to a stand alone speaker. But just for the advance in speaker and sound quality, this is another move in the right direction, much like the camera.Sound quality:The iPhone 4 and Nexus 4 to date have the best sound quality of any phone I've ever used (I hear the International S3 has a Wolfson Dac, but I never had the chance of trying it out, so no comments). The HTC One sounds quite similar to the IPhone 4 in sound quality and that is a great factor for audio aficionados. The HTC beats enhancement just doesn't cut it for me, so I installed my own EQ app to adjust as I pleased, and the sound is just the sweet spot of clarity and dynamic range. Capable of driving over the ear AudioTechnicas M50 very well. These are all subjective remarks, hopefully someone will be doing some actual measurements on the HTC One soon. But these remarks should put some people at ease. This phone is not google's nexus 7 tablet with its terrible, anemic sound quality. No need to worry about that here.Battery:Big enough for a day of work, but fails in comparison the upcoming S4 and Motorolla's droid razor max hd. It will provide enough juice to power through 13 hours of work. A full charge the night before, plus stand by and a whole day of work totals about 20 hours of continuous use. Install juice protector and enjoy your battery last longer.Conclusion:Outdoes every phone released in 2012 by a mile. Sexy, stunning design matched by a beautiful streamlined interface. It's perhaps corny to say this, since it's overly used, but this is the BEST phone I have ever used. I don't think apple will match it this year with the same design iPhone 5s that seems hollow and fragile when compared to the HTC One, and same old icon interface. Much the same, Samsung apears to have followed Apple's lead and released an S4 that deserves the title S3s, since it's more of a continuation of a well established brand. But the same cheap build quality continues in a trade off for removable battery and micro SD. Something Blackberry seems to have managed in a better fashion. Their phone accomplishes the same with a better build quality. The only company that seems to be hiding the game is google, and theirs may be the contender with the HTC One for title of best smartphone of 2013.The HTC One is missing a removable battery and a micro SD slot which they make up for by charging you $199 under contract for 32GB, instead of apple's outrageous $299. In my view, it doesn't detract from the experience one bit, just like it didn't from the Nexus 4. I feel quite comfortable using the HTC One as my only phone and have already passed most of my devices forward with the exception of the Nexus 4. And depending on google's move, if they don't include LTE this year, the Htc One will be the only phone I'll be using all year long. And gladly so.

B00BJL133C,A39TF3CW0JEK3H,"Santosh Geddamuri Sr. ""Happysan""","[3, 3]","I was an apple guy until this phone. In last 8 months I moved from iphone 5 to lumia 900 then lumia 920 again iphone 5 and finally HTC One. Yah, I need change and I guess I will settle down with htc one for a while. There are many good things about this phone which attracted me to get away from iphone 5.Mainly the build quality. Finally you can compare this directly to iphone 5's build quality. Though htc one exceeds iphone 5. I had iphone 5 for couple months and I can see dings here there. Also the body looked very weak. But HTC one looks rock solid. The screen is much better then iphone 5. The brightness and pixels really pops out. Dual speaker is a added benefit, though it's not a huge difference. I am using launched 8 on ONE and using it as a full time windows 8 phone. I moved away from lumia because of apps. But I liked the user interface of windows 8.

B00BJL133C,A3VOLV3HZPA6TS,W. Lee,"[5, 5]","This is for the AT&T; version. No differences really between the international expeept for the unlocked bands and depending if it's the developers edition, the unlocked bootloader.First off, I am a phone junkie. I switch phones very often and most of the devices I've owned from HTC has been the original TMobile G1, G2, Droid Incredible, AT&T; One X and One X+. I love Android but been open to other OSes from Apple, Windows and even Blackberries. Android is more suited for my personality and I love the ease of customizations without jailbreaking my iphone and so forth.Design:This is going to be the first thing that you are attracted to. The aluminum zero gap is absolutely stunning and sturdy. There's nothing like it. My wife has an iphone 5 and it has nothing on the HTC One. My previous best design would go to the White One X (white polycarbonate gets extremely dirty) and this HTC One is leaps and bounds above that and makes it feels very premium, as every smartphone considering they costs much more than anything much larger than them.Screen and Sound:The next you notice would be the screen and sound, which right off the bat you can tell is much better than anything you've ever used because 1). It's facing you and 2). Stereo sound. Listen to music when you get the chance and you'll hear the difference. After the phone fully boots up, you notice how crisp and clear the screen is. The average smartphone user may find it difficult to distinguish between 720p and 1080p. Do we really need 1080p? No, I personally think 720p was fine but I'm not complaining. Really have to see in person to admire.Sense 5 and Blinkfeed:Sense 5 is finally at that point where I can say it's beautiful. Its not stock Android (Jellybean) pretty but it doesn't look dated like it did on Sense 4 (which I hated but lived with). It's looks modern.Blinkfeed, people are comparing it to Windows Phone tiles which I think is a bad comparison. It's more like Flipboard. If you used Flipboard, you'll feel at home. I personally like it. I am a wallpaper junkie as well and change my wallpaper often. WIth Blinkfeed being my main page, I don't really change my wallpaper often because I don't see it as much. I have 2 pages, Blinkfeed and another one for my mainly used apps. Thats it. Hopefully HTC puts out an update where we can manage our own feeds except for the one that's preloaded.Camera:HTC One uses a new 4mp (Ultrapixel) camera. I am not a professional photographer but I do take pictures of my kids. A lot of them. The One X had the best camera on a smartphone for 2012 (Had an S3 and Lumia 920) so I didn't expect anything less from HTC. Megapixel count means nothing to me. Zoe is also and also an awesome feature that I use often and the Video Highlight feature is really great. A life ""trailer"" if I may that does it beautifully with no effort on my part. It takes everything from a given event and makes a 30 second video. You have to see it to understand.Battery:The HTC One house a 2300 mAh battery. Not much of an upgrade from the One X+ (2100 mAh). When I first started using the HTC One, I was able to get a full day out of it. I use to get 13-15hrs before it hits at least 10% with regular usage (Pulse app, Gmail, Texting all day, music streaming and camera uses). Then I read an article on the power saver feature (which I rarely used on the One X+) and it says it we can actually benefit more by leaving it on instead of only when in situations that calls for it. So I gave it a shot and I must say. It is awesome. I can actually get close to a full day with at least 2 hours on screen time before needing to charge.Etc...The IR blaster is a wonderful feature that I use often to control my tv and (i lost the remote to my home theater) and now I can turn the volume up or down without getting up. There are some flaws though, I cant program my volume up and down for my tv on the phone. It doesn't work for some reason but it's not a biggie.The placement of the IR blaster/power/sleep button is weird but you'll get use to it. It's like brushing your teeth with your right hand until you damage it. You have to learn to brush with your other left. It's not normal but eventually you'll adjust.The capacitive buttons are now just back and home. I wished it had all 3 buttons because I hate how some apps have that menu bar which takes up space it really doesn't need to on the screen. I used Android when it had 4 (menu, search, back and home) and then they have you get use to (back, home, and recent) with HTC giving you the option on Sense 4 to use the recent key (when long press) to be the menu. HTC, PLEASE, give us an update to bring this minor feature back. (I don't want to root my phone and wait for a dev to implement this feature).Throwing in earbuds with the phone is a nice plus. Better than average I must say and they actually fit in my ear. Thanks!!!Almost a week now and I am absolutely in love with this phone. I don't even want to use a case but I know I am going to have to down the line since I can be clumsy.Push updates out in a timely manner and I'm hoping 6 months down the line, I don't see an HTC One+.",5.0,1366848000,"04 25, 2013",HTC ONE M7 32GB 4G LTE Android Smartphone (Unlocked) - Sliver,418.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51OD4eeWeeL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3933},HTC,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0

The flip feature works nicely, as you can prop up the phone and watch videos hands-free. I do have a couple of complaints though. The front part of the case that covers the screen initially closes right on top of the phone. But I've been using for only 2 days and now since I've opened and closed the cover several times, the front flap no longer rests right on top of the phone right away. I thinks it's too lightweight of a material. I'm not sure how the similar cases for the Galaxy or iPhone are, but I would think they could insert some small weights into the edges so that the flap closes snugly each time. Also, at the point where the case bends for the flip feature, creases have started to appear. I think the core of the case if probably made of cardboard, and I'm concerned that if I use the flip enough, it may eventually tear. There are also noticeable gaps between the plastic top and bottom of the case that snaps onto the phone and the rest of the panels. I have noticed some dirt can get in there, and I worry this would cause scratches on the phone. I have to make a habit out of taking the case off every few days and removing any debris from the interior of the case to prevent this.

One from my Palm Pixi, one from my Nexus 4, one from my Nook, one from my Blackberry, one from my Logitech keyboard, many others, and one from my HTC Droid Incredible 2. Of all the cables, HTC's was the best. It's the perfect length, at around 4 feet. Apple's cables are a tad too short, 6 foot cables are too long. 4 feet is a great balance. The material of the cabling on HTC's cable is similar to Apple's in comfort, but a little stronger feeling - a welcome change. The plug ends of the cable feel well made, not likely to break. They're nicely grippy, too. HTC has a good design with their cables.At the cheap price these are sold at, and the number of vendors, I recommend buying a few cables from different sellers. Buying ""OEM"" ones doesn't always mean you're getting a HTC-made one, they're often knockoffs. I got lucky with my first purchase, the second one wasn't as nice. Still not a bad cable, just not as nice as the first.

B00J3554KE,A2E1OU9011O1KE,Steve H.,"[5, 5]","I got the HTC One M7 about a year ago and was hesitant to upgrade to the M8.  After all, the M7 is still a fast phone, is beautiful, and is still a sexy phone.  Well, I got the chance to get a unit from HTC to review, test, demo, etc. and I can say whole-heartedly:  It IS worth the upgrade.Sound:  HTC switched from Beats Audio to their own Boomsound software to enhance sound.  It's hard to say if one is better than the other as they both have advantages in certain scenarios, but one thing is clear:  this phone is MUCH louder than the M7 and still sounds great!  I cannot impress upon you how much everyone is impressed when I share a video with friends around the table.  The headphone jack on this one gets a touch louder than the previous version as well.The display is beautiful.  I have to say that it's really hard to tell a difference from the already great M7 display except for two things:  1.  It's bigger.  2. the auto-brightness works better (the M7 wanted to go a touch brighter than I wanted it and was slower to adjust than the M8.  The M8 is faster to adjust, stays at a better level indoors and gets to the super-bright I need in direct sunlight.Design:  When the photos of this phone came out, I didn't think it looked as nice as the previous version.  Once I saw the new one in person, I have to say that pictures do not do it justice.  It looks better than the previous one.  The tolerances and seams are so much tighter than last year's (which was awesome to begin with and put competitors to shame).  The finish looks really expensive and, contrary to many comments, is not slippery at all (feels noticeably less slippery than a phone from a larger competitor that my employer issued to me).  The glass layer over the speakers grills is a really nice touch.Camera:  The camera is really great.  It gets better white balance than the previous version and is super fast.  I can get great pictures of food in a dim bar and it gets the colors right on top of that without noise or grain! Example in a dark restaurant:[...]I'm very fond of the UFocus feature which lends a really nice bokeh effect thanks to the second ""depth of field"" camera on the back.  Amazingly, the selfie-cam is 5MP which really takes awesome shots worth keeping!  Seriously...have you ever seen a front facing shot that was worthing keeping or in which you didn't kick yourself for using the front camera?!  People complain of lack of detail...look at this picture and notice the subtle veins on the flower! [...]I've used this phone side by side with a larger competitors phone and this one is noticeably faster.  Really...go into a store and try it.  You'll be amazed and won't be able to go back.Something I really, really love with this phone:  with either the Dot View case or the standard flip cover case (I've used both extensively), the phone sleeps or unlocks with an open or close of the case without having to swipe to unlock.  I really like this touch!Finally...Blinkfeed:  I really, really love this!  If you've ever used Flipboard, Google Currents, or other news aggregators, you'll wonder how they got it so wrong once you try Blinkfeed for a week.  It has everything I want in a pretty format (like Flipboard) but way, way faster.Do yourself a favor and get this phone.

Everyday I learn something new about the phone and it surprises me. The fast processor loads programs in a flash then multitasking is amazing.The so called bad crappy is not of an issue to me since im not a big camera fanatic and it shouldnt be a big judgement on the phone. Personally, I find myself having so much fun with the camera from the 3D dimensions to the unfocusing and stickers.  The front speakers are really amazing sounds like concert coming from the phone. The 5 inch 1080p display is amazing to watch videos and just gaze at your phone. The slim design makes comfortable in one hand. The catches other iOS users to analyze my phone consider actually buying it. Its great phone and I would recommend to everyone. Never worry about space with the extra MicroSD slot.Pros:-Sleek & Elegant.-Front Speakers-Camera Effects(find your self becoming a photographer)-Face Recognition unlocking-4.4.2 Kit Kat-Motion Launch-MicroSD(Up 128GB)-Ultra Fast load times.- Control your TVCons:-UltraPixel Camera(sometime you can notice it, not a big concern)-Not waterproofPersonally to me no real cons.Good phone to transfer over to if your a iOS user.",5.0,1397174400,"04 11, 2014",HTC One M8 - Factory Unlocked 32GB - US Warranty (Gunmetal Grey),630.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510p0WeVhaL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1309},HTC,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0
