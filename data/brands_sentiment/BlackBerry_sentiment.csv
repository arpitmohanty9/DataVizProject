B000FFEH04,AEJAGHLC675A7,John Williamson,"[6, 6]","Made a decision early this year to pick up a newBlackBerry Curve 8330as a better method of communicating with clients and family. Had seen reviews that averaged 4.4 out of 5, so it seemed to be a decent choice. This turned out to be one of the best decisions made this year, as the BlackBerry turned out to be far better than expected... it was faster than my previous phone, reliable, versatile and rugged, and there were few dropped calls. But the phone had one simple problem: it's a battery eater!Went to my cell phone provider to see about getting an extra battery, and was surprised to find that the standard 1000 mAh OEM Lithium Ion battery cost was almost $45.00. That seemed a bit steep, so I began searching here on Amazon.com and found this Blackberry Li-Ion [OEM] C-S2 Battery. Was cautious because of the extreme price difference, but figured that if it was truly an OEM C-S2 battery, it was worth the gamble.Examined it when it arrived, and found that it not only had the original BlackBerry logo, but was marked C-S2 on the face, the correct version for my phone (and many other BlackBerry models). The back listed it as a Lithium Ion Battery, 3.7V, with a capacity of 1150mAh 4.3Wh... identical to my original battery. So it was charged overnight, as had done when the phone was first received with the original battery.It was good choice, as the battery has been a perfect backup to my original. It has function just the same as the original C-S2 battery, and there seems to be no difference. Went on to buy a second backup, just because it seemed to be a good idea for those ""better safe than sorry"" situations. Must admit that I do use the built-in GPS quite a bit, and that along with frequent 'Net access, probably accounts for my need of extra battery power. Might note that I picked up anExternal Battery Charger For Blackberry 8300 8320 8330, which has been the perfect compliment to these batteries.One might note that the prices on the BlackBerry C-S2 OEM batteries seem to vary quite a bit here, but most seem to come in well under $7.00... far less that what the cell phone retailers are charging. Do your searching here on Amazon.com and you'll find some excellent prices on these.If your battery seems to not last as long as the original specs for the BlackBerry stated, you can argue with the retailer... or waste far less time and get one of these C-S2 OEM batteries here.

While this battery at first glance has the same label (quite easy to fake, of course), it is actually marked ""Made in China."" Another subtle difference is that the OEM battery that came with my Blackberry listed its milliamps (if I recall, 1400 mA). This battery has no designation at all of its amp rating. Now considering that the real thing costs $40-$50 at most cellular retail stores, and this item was one-seventh the price, what can I expect? Still, there is the little matter of false advertising...they are calling this genuine OEM.

B000ROGDNM,ADLVFFE4VBT8,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[0, 0]","This has been my longest lasting holster for a Blackberry, so far. Over 2 years and counting.To me, 'wearing' a Blackberry is second-nature, having had one attached to may waist for more than 10 years now, so I may be as good as getting my Blackberry in an out if its holster as a gunslinger is with his gun. There's a lot I like about this holster and here I'm putting it down in a list:- makes it easy to get the Blackberry out or lock it in quickly- professional-looking black leather- the rubberized sides make it hold the BB tight- strong magnetic locking - VERY strong, really- swivel is okay, makes it easier to clip/unclip the holster- solid, strong build - like I said, I've been wearing this one almost daily for more than 2 years and it doesn't show signs of breaking or cracking yetTwo so-so or interesting remarks. First, I agree with another reviewer that it's not so friendly to love handles. I can't say that I have them but, in the summer, when my employer (thank you employer) allows me to dress very casually, the clip sometimes presses into my skin. This is not a problem at all during other seasons because I have something tucked in my pants then so the clip does not touch the skin directly. Secondly, it's the magnetic lock. It's so strong, it will pick up small metallic objects such as paperclips and even larger ones if they happen to be near.Overall, I am happy with this holster and I'm likely to be using it for a while longer. It's a 5-star.",5.0,1251331200,"08 27, 2009","Blackberry Swivel Holster for Blackberry 8300, 8310, 8320, 8330 (Pitch Black)",12.7,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41n6-PzH5SL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 118446},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]",1.0
B000ROGDNM,AIFLY2HF8NS8U,Andre Lawrence,"[0, 0]","I just upgraded my Blackberry from the 7100 to the Curve Titanium (TMO).  I wanted to protect this investment and, as usual, I like to get critical feedback from people whom actually have the product and can attest to its value.After purchasing the swivel case and screen protector, here's my initial observation for the past two weeks.Excellent.  The case was a better cover that the one supplied by Blackberry.  The magnet encased arm snaps and hold the phone snuggly in place.  Some times, I twirl the phone around in my hand, just to see where gaps would form.  The combination of the magnetic strap and the elastic sides keeps the phone in place securely.I had to resolve an annoying problem that evident with the phone itself and not with the accessories: slippage.  With the 7100, the design had a loop at the bottom of the phone where you could (and I did!) rig a wrist strap.  I looped the wrist strap into the old 7100 case and it never fell out.  That's part of the reason I had the 7100 for 4 years.However, there is no place to put a wrist strap on the Curve so, I bought a skin.  Well, how does the skin work with the holster and screen guard?Perfectly!  The black skin and the black leather holster really enhances the look and the feel of the phone (too bad it's not 3G!.)  With regard to earlier commentators dislike for it-- I found the phone to fit more snuggly.  The difference between having and not having the skin on in the holster is negligible at best.  In fact, it's an added benefit because if you put the phone down and it falls off the table on to whatever surface--think the concrete surface outdoor-- if that phone falls diagonally, you will see a dent or a crack in the phone.  Having the skin on prevents that.About the belt clip being useless--NONSENSE!  It has a very strong spring. You want it to be tight so the phone and the holster itself won't spring off when you bump against something or someone.  Taking mass transit here in Miami, I can attest to phone clips popping off while rushing in and out of trains.This leather holster is a good deal whether you buy other accessories for the Curve or not.",5.0,1231718400,"01 12, 2009","Blackberry Swivel Holster for Blackberry 8300, 8310, 8320, 8330 (Pitch Black)",12.7,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41n6-PzH5SL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 118446},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]",1.0

If you buy it off amazon it can cost you anywhere from $5 to $10 which really isn't that much for a leather case.  If you're just looking for something to put your phone in, then this case probably won't disappoint for the price.However, If you're looking for something a bit better (and really, you wouldn't have to look that far), then the price will come up, but quality will greatly increase too.My dad just got a Blackberry 8800 and got two cases by accident and gave me one.

My cell phone comes with a MICRO USB plug for charging and syncing.  I wanted to eliminate a cable during travel.This unit operates off a MINI USB plug.  This means I cannot operate it from my cell phone's charger, which is what I anticipated when I bought the unit.  However, read on.The MINI USB input is the typical one you find on a camera, card reader, or older phone.  So it's easy to pick one up or find one laying around the house.The GOOD thing is there is a USB output.  Therefore, I can charge both my extra battery AND my phone from one USB outlet.  I use a MINI usb cable to this unit.  Then I use the MICRO USB sync cable that came from my phone to go from the output of this charger to my phone.  I'll add a picture to show how I use it.The LED light is moderately useful.  OTHER chargers have a clear transition from charging (blinking orange color) to finished (not blinking, green).  THIS CHARGER glows solid yellow while charging and SLOWLY goes to a solid green color at full charge.  I never feel you've charged the whole way, and I wonder whether I'm really seeing yellow or green because the color is very similar.I almost want to discount one star because of these issues, but for the price this device has excellent utility and fits my needs.Note: I tried charging both the battery and my phone at the same time off my PC USB, and I got an error on my phone that there is not enough power to charge the battery.

There is a good reason this is included with the original phone, it has important functions that will increase not only your phone's life, but your battery life as well. The magnet in the case (make sure the phone is facing so that you can see the front through the little notch) puts the phone in sleep mode. Without that, the phone will constantly be being activated when you move around, and the battery goes pretty quick. In addition to this, you can set a custom ring tone profile for when it's in its holster.The snug fit and sturdy construction protect the phone - I gave my old 8300 to my son with a cool-looking (and expensive) Body Glove pouch (BIG mistake!) and within a month the screen was cracked.

Until recently, I had to compromise by getting my sister's discarded 7100 kept that plugged in and swapping batteries every night when I came home-- because her 7100 had a different malfunction that made her phone inoperable.I just upgraded to the Curve in December and didn't want to go to the hassles of having that piece fall out again.  RIM finally came to their senses and added an additional port to charge the phone.  By way of the two (2) copper strips just beneath the battery cover.I bought the charge pod and have been using it for more than a month now and I can say it works great.  It's designed for the Curve, but the width of the opening is, strangely enough, wider that the phone.  So much so, that the phone slides from side to side.  I suspect that the Bold may also have a been a consideration when designing this pod.The charge pod does not come with the charge plug/ wire.  You need to have the one supplied with the BB or else the charge pod is useless.  Roughly about 2.5 inches in length about 1 inch high and 2 inches in width.Otherwise, a fine purchase that saves on the wear and tear of charging by the side outlet.",5.0,1234915200,"02 18, 2009",RIM Charging Pod - 5V DC - USB,3.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21bgUmSlRcL.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 120618},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Cell Phone Docks']]",-1.0

I can't comment on whether or not it will sync, I'm going out on a limb & saying it won't because it's only making contact with the battery connections, which is fine because it's exactly why I bought this, FOR CHARGING.  I was tired of having to plug in my BB & kept reading of people messing up theirs by repeatedly plugging it in so this has put my mind at ease.  I only sync my BB once a month so I'm not worried about any more.  A lot of people have commented that the BB symbol is really bright when it's plugged in & if you have this in your bedroom you won't be able to sleep.  I have this on my nightstand & have NO problem at all falling asleep, it doesn't seem bright to me at all, please note that I have one of those alarm clocks that projects the time on the wall so maybe I'm just used to it, but even plugged into a totally dark room, it just doesn't seem that bright, guess it's an individual thing.  The only thing that I'd improve about this charging pod is I think it would have been a lot cooler if the BB symbol would change colors when charging was complete.  It glows white when it's plugged in, plain & simple, whether your BB in it or not, I think a simple color change would cool but that's just me.  I have to take off my silicone cover to use this but that's not nearly a big enough pain to take off a star, it's worth it for me.  If you go with this, I don't think you'll be disappointed.

Moreover, a handy feature (controlled by options you can choose on the phone settings) can automatically shift the Bold to clock mode when it is charging.  So you drop it in the dock, and it become your night clock. Great.My problem is simple: after a couple of months, it stopped working reliably. I put it in the dock, but the phone does not charge. Or, it does charge, but then twenty minutes later it stops.  Easy to tell, because if it is not charging, it also does not shift into clock mode. So it sits in the pod, not charging. And because it isn't in clock mode it will ring if someone calls, not what you probably want in the middle of the night (especially if you are traveling and your caller does not realize the time zone you are in).  Somehow or another, the phone stopped connecting reliably to the dock.I am still using it, but instead of leaving the charger connected to the docking station, I plug and unplug the charger's cord from the phone itself each time, and use the docking station as just a stand. Still kind of works, but not the way it is supposed to and not so handy.  A disappointment.Perhaps I just got a bad one, as I don't notice this complaint from others.UPDATE:  The problem was the phone not the charging pod.  I replaced the phone on warranty on another issue, and discovered that the new phone charged just fine in this pod.

B001GJECR6,A2F3PPNCQXQCFH,Leo G.,"[1, 1]","I love this charging pod so much I purchased 3 more for friends after receiving the first (and they love theirs too).You cannot tell from the picture, but the inside of the pod has charging pins that protrude slightly and when the Blackberry is placed into the pod the pins touch charging contacts on both sides of your Blackberry which enables charging. The Blackberry sits upright and displays the clock while charging (at least the BB Bold 9000 does). The charger pod does not come with an AC cord but you just plug your original Blackberry AC cord into the back of the pod and from then on just drop the BB into the pod and it begins charging immediately. No buttons to push. Very simple and I have to say it looks great too, matching my BB very nicely.If you use your BB extensively as I do, you might want to purchase two pods (and one additional AC cord) so that you can have one pod at work and one at home. It sure makes it nice to just drop my BB in and not have to fumble trying to plug or unplug the AC cord into the BB every night. The pod prices can very slightly, however, the shipping charges are what make the difference in the final cost.

However, I purchased 2 of them, one for home and another for work. I use them both daily.Prior to purchasing the charger/sync pods I had purchased an extended battery that lasted so long it never came close to running out of juice during the day, no matter what I used my Blackberry for. Unfortunately, the ""door"" for the back of the Storm that was included with the battery was so flimsy that it didn't last very long -- maybe 6 months or so. My only option was to purchase another extended battery (which I didn't need) just to get another flimsy door. I decided instead to reinsert my original (non-extended) battery with original (non-flimsy) door and get the 2 pods for easy recharge.I work in IT so the one at work just sits there at my desk. I keep the one at home on my nightstand by my alarm clock. So now, I keep my Storm easily recharged by inserting the phone into the pods when not in use. And I keep it in ""bedside"" (or ""clock"") mode so I have a nice clock to look at. At home I have a backup alarm (which I was using it for already). I can also activate the photo ""slide"" feature and have my Blackberry display my photos like one of those electronic picture frames. And best of all, the battery stays charged as if I have an extended battery just as conveniently.The only negative is that I must carry an extra charger for the car, but that's not really a fault of the pod, of course.The very nice design and convenience of this pod or dock is well-worth the small cost for the unit. You do have to purchase an additional wall charger for it (one doesn't come with the pod). This is a little inconvenient, but they are fairly easy to find and also super-inexpensive.

B001LRPN0S,A2I18AO597DSDI,"David Pearlman ""sound fanatic""","[11, 11]","There are so many sketchy sellers selling phone chargers out there, that it can be a bit scary. The problem is that if the charger is poorly made, the output of the charger can be out of spec and can, in some cases, fry the phone you connect to it.For that reason, when it comes to phone chargers, you should stick to name brands. (They are all made in China, but the name brand ones are usually subject to stricter QA).When I found this charger on Amazon, SOLD BY AMAZON, I jumped on it. It's a MICRO USB charger, made for the Blackberry and sold under the Blackberry name, in retail packaging. The rated output is 5V and 700mA.This charger should work fine with most any phone that uses the MICRO USB connector. The key number to pay attention to is the second one, the rated amperage. This is the MAXIMUM amount of current that the phone can request from the charger. A typical USB port on a PC provides as little as 100mA, and few provide more than 500mA. So this charger should charge your phone faster than when it's connected to a PC. A few phones out now can use up to 1000mA. But that just means they CAN use that amount. If 700mA is provided, they'll still charge, just a bit more slowly.This is an excellent quality name brand travel micro USB charger at a price that beats the no-name junk from third party sellers.

Nice folding blades for travel packing.  Good cord.  Good connector.Now its output is rated at only 700mA compared to the charger that came with the MyTouch 4G which is 1000mA (1A), but I haven't done any scientific tests to see if it limits the charge rate on a very low battery.  These ratings are usually so conservative, and I can't see them setting an initial charge rate > 0.5C-0.7C.  On a 1400mAh cell, this comes out to 700mA-1000mA for the initial charge rate on a depleted battery, but that only lasts for about 15 minutes of the charge cycle anyway.  So from what I know about LiIon chargers and cells (I'm an Electrical Engineer who develops consumer products with LiIon batteries and chargers), I think this charger will keep up just fine with the MyTouch 4G.And that estimation bears out with the admittedly unscientific observations I've made -- it seems to charge about as fast on this charger as it does with the one that came with the phone.",5.0,1301961600,"04 5, 2011","BlackBerry Folding Blade Micro-USB Charger for BlackBerry 8900, Storm 9530, Tour 9630, and Torch 9800 - Black",0.51,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51eqJWWtDRL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2268},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Travel Chargers']]",1.0

It is really well made and will not tilt over since it feels solid.I was really pleased at the automatic bedside mode feature where the clock comes on when its in this cradle (It comes on when you plug in the blackberry the normal way as well, so its more of the Curve 8900's feature then the cradles) so it makes for a great bedside clock.  The light that's on this pod is also very useful when you want to place it on the cradle at night.Of course the only issue is that if you buy a crystal cover to protect your blackberry you can't really use this since you have to take the cover off every time you want to put it on this charging pod, so a silicone cover may be better if you want to use this since it can be slipped off easily.Your existing charger's USB connector plugs into this device.I enjoy using this especially with Slacker Radio, Flycast and other applications that can consume quite a bit of battery power, so it also works as my desktop radio, MP3 player etc.An overall comment on the 8900, its really an amazing device.

Why you ask?Simple....RIM decided to change the charging connector on the 8900 to Micro-USB....it is no longer Mini-USB.  To me it annoying to fiddle around with and get the connector in properly....its very thin and orientation is key.  I primarily use this dock in my bedroom and sometimes its dark in there....dark enough that I dont need to mess with wires and damage connectors..etc.  The doc makes it easy to drop the blackberry in for charging.You simply connect the micro-usb ac adapter to the dock....and drop your BB in for charging at any given time.  VOILA - works perfectly.5/5ps.  If you own a BOLD or you are planning on a BOLD - there is a dock available for that too.

B001OD2OAQ,A3DHS97DOBZDBW,Adriana V.,"[0, 0]","I made the leap into the smartphone world, coming off an old flip-LG phone that I *loved*.  I wasn't sure I'd even really like the BlackBerry, as it's a bar phone and I always chose flip models, but I love it.  Sure, the Javelin doesn't have 3G, but for most things, the EDGE network is perfectly fast and 3G isn't so much faster that I miss it for web browsing.Call Quality - in all honesty, I don't call much on the phone, but it gets plenty loud and I can usually hear calls just fine.  It doesn't drop calls unless my service sputters (ATT), but overall I have no complaints.Keypad - On this, I'm much pickier.  I love the QWERTY keyboard on this model.  My work phone is a BlackBerry World Edition 8830, whose keys are much more similar to the Bold and Tour.  I don't like those keypads as much.  There was, of course, a slight learning curve on the Javelin in typing time, but now typing is a breeze.  I type an awful lot on Gchat, via SMS, and via BlackBerry messenger, and I have no problem with the keys.  They're great, they're separated, and I don't often make a mistake on them.Trackball - I cannot praise this trackball enough.  RIM finally did away with the old recessed trackballs and created one that feels smooth and effortless.  I love it.Media player - I didn't actually expect to use this, but I lost my mp3 player.  I popped in an 8 gb microSDHC card (didn't have to remove the battery - nice feature), loaded up some music, and popped in earbuds.  Music doesn't sound so phenomenal that audiophiles would be happy with it, but to me it sounded perfectly acceptable.  Videos and pictures look spectacular on the display, and there's a playlist option for music.  All in all, pretty impressive for a phone meant for email.Display - Gorgeous.  Absolutely flawless.  Pictures look amazing, it's a pleasure to look at the screen.Connectivity - Again, no 3G on this device.  Unless you need to use data while talking on the phone, you won't miss it.Speaker - LOUD.  Not awesome sounding, but better than most mp3 players' built in speakers.Reasons why it gets 4 starts instead of 5 - MicroUSB, why?  Why remove the miniUSB that SO much of my other electronics have?  I hope I don't lose the charger . . . It can be a little laggy occasionally.  It's tough to find good accessories for this particular model.  It was $150 with a contract, why no accessories?  It should be much easier to find a good skin and screen protectors.All in all, the device is fantastic.  It's smaller than the Bold and the Tour, the screen is outrageously good, and it's a pleasure to type on.  I'd highly recommend it.",4.0,1261526400,"12 23, 2009","BlackBerry Curve 8900 Javelin Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, GPS Navigation, Stereo Bluetooth, and MicroSD Slot--US Version with No Warranty (Black)",89.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41A0geDs8PL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 25531},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0

B001OD2OAQ,A2WLNSZ9U0T1S3,"Tarun Chachra ""Tarun Chachra""","[137, 143]","HI All.I have used a blackberry for over 10 years now...give or take. I have always been impressed by the devices they have created in the past and the current line of devices. Since I like to be on the bleeding edge of tech, I just had to get a 8900.Most of you know by now what the new feature sets are of blackberries that are out today. The bold, the storm, and now this one The JAVELIN.I wont go into too much detail but I will give you my quick run down.The Javelin is perhaps the thinnest, lightest, small footprint blackberry that I have ever used. It sports a great look and the feel to the hands is awesome. It is after all the curve II. Screen comparison to the bold is that this unit has a higher resolution then the bold but a smaller physical screen. The higher resolution definitely adds some clarity to the screen...but it should be duly noted that the BOLD's screen is also beautiful. Yes I own both.The Javelin is a EDGE/Wi-FI device...it does not have 3G capabilities. Technically you only need 3G if you want to be on the phone and receive/send emails at the same time when using your mobile connections...I personally have never needed that functionality. However, please note that if you are connected to WI-FI you are able to be on a telephone call and receive/send email etc over wi-fi....works perfectly.The Javelin has a new processor which makes the device FLY. Yes the processor is slower then the one in the Bold, but one can hardly tell the difference....I have used both for weeks...and I can honestly say you will not notice the speed difference.I have a 8gb MicroSD card installed in the device and use the software available from blackberry to synchronize all of my DRM free music from iTunes to the Blackberry. A must buy if you want to carry one device that does it all. Amazon has great prices on micro-sd cards.....Here are what I consider to be the best features on the Javelin:1. AUTOFOCUS 3.2mp Camera - It is AWESOME. Picture taking, due to focus, is a bit slower....however, the clarity and quality of the picture make it all worthwhile.2. FOOTPRINT - Great looking device with a great size.3. High Resolution screen - Awesome clarity....4. The functionality of a blackberry has always been a pro..and this one makes it better with a faster processor and more zippy feel.The three BAD things:1. The speaker on this thing is so TINNY....that it hurts my ears with certain tones.....there is NO bass what so ever. That is to be expected in a device this small....so maybe some new tones need to be tested out.2. Micro-USB - Why take something like mini-usb and replace it with something new. Now I have to get all new chargers, travel chargers, etc.... Upsetting but bareable.3. The holster in the BOX is simply a pleather pouch of sorts...no belt clip etc... You will need to buy an aftermarket leather/plastic holster if you wish to attach to your belt. Not a deal breaker...but should be mentioned.I am posting some images for your review also.Overall this is a great 5 Star Device.",5.0,1234051200,"02 8, 2009","BlackBerry Curve 8900 Javelin Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, GPS Navigation, Stereo Bluetooth, and MicroSD Slot--US Version with No Warranty (Black)",89.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41A0geDs8PL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 25531},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0

I am an average size man and never thought I had small ears, so I was surprised that the smallest ear pieces fit best. I think that one of the problems people may be having is either not trying the smaller ear pieces or because even the smallest are still too large.I think that the sound is excellent. While I have not tried a very expensive set (Bose) I have used a lot of sets from various electronics and sets I have purchased independently. These are by far the best pair of earphones I have used in terms of sound quality and comfort.

Bought this because my original C-S2 battery and a backup of the same were failing.The original that came with the phone is listed at 1150mAh, and is supposed to have a talk time of three hours, with a standby time of 1 days. When my talk time had hit under an hour and standby time was less than a day, it was time to replace it. Since the BlackBerry C-S2 battery has a cryptographic chip to ensure you're using the right one for the particular BlackBerry smartphone you have, it should either work or be a dud.And when I received this battery, it was a dud.But going back to the original documentation for these, the BlackBerry C-S2 battery requires a full 8-hour or longer charge before it can be used, so I charged this one. That did the trick... to some degree.This replacement has never been quite up to the talk time of the original when it was new, but at about 2 hours, it wasn't worth sending back, so I've kept it. This one is better than another that I picked up here from another vendor, so it was better to hold onto one that worked as opposed to one that didn't.Your experiences may be different, and from some of the reviews posted here, that seems to be the case. If I planned on keeping my 9330 Curve for a few more years, I might have complained, but there are other smartphones that get better life (and performance) today, so this one is at least a solution that keeps it going for now.If you get one of theseBlackberry Standard Lithium-ion Replacement Battery C-S2packs here, my only suggestion is that you charge it for 8-12 hours before you use it.

I've only been using my first set for about six hours, and most of that has been getting ""quality opinions"" from those that I trust while using them on my Incredible in several situations that I encounter regularly.Everyone I called, without exception, literally raved about the quality of my ""sound"", and several compared it to the very best land-line connection they've experienced.  On the receive end, the default volume setting when I plugged them in was almost to the point of pain; I had to turn the volume nearly off for comfortable listening, so there would be absolutely no problem using these in very noisy places (at least on my end).  I like the fact that without the silicone earbud option, they're still comfortable for extended wear, but you have nearly normal hearing when they're set at a reasonable level, so driving safety is not hampered.  If I wanted to block out any other sounds, I'd use my expensive noise canceling headphones, but my intent for these was mostly hand-free phone use; being able to hear traffic, sirens, etc can be a huge safety bonus!If there is a flaw to this ridiculously-cheap headset, it's the fact that the microphone is not noise canceling. My work van is noisy at highway speeds, and I did get reports of hearing a ""roar"" in the background (but that listener did point out that there was no problem with him to be able to understand me perfectly; it was just that the background noise was ""distracting"" when I wasn't talking.  I did slow down to about 35 mph as a test, and that background noise ""went away"".Although my Incredible, until the new software update that's coming soon, doesn't support voice dialing, it does have a ""voice search"" feature with one button push on the ""Car Panel""...  ...I've found that the extra-clear audio of this headset resulted in perfect, mistake-free name recognition with that program, and error-free dialing in at least a half-dozen test calls.After the great reports I've gotten during my full evening of ""testing"", I'm parking my Bluetooth for most applications; so far, I haven't found the cord to be a problem when my phone's in it's holster or in the windshield mount. (I could possibly change my mind about that after a few weeks of use, but the superior quality achieved with this headset is worth a little extra hassle with a cord.)When contact after contact kept telling me that they've never had a better, clearer, telephone conversation (and far superior to my Incredible when ""hand held"" in its normal mode, I plan to place every call I can with this headset!By the way, the music quality is also very good with this headset, way superior to anything within $25 or so of this price.Can you tell I'm excited and enthused? :-)I've had so many truly ""rotten"" conversation with people on cell phones during the past 40 years; ""if I were King"", I'd mandate that everyone who called me used this product.",5.0,1276560000,"06 15, 2010",BlackBerry 3.5mm Stereo Headset - (OEM) - HDW-14322-001,4.89,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41X%2BNlO6DoL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 197127},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Wired Headsets']]",1.0

B001UC9NOQ,ADLVFFE4VBT8,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[178, 179]","This is a generic 'Type A to Micro B' USB cable and it's in no way Blackberry specific but, YES, it WILL work with a BB Bold or Storm. I needed one of these to connect one camera to the computer because I lost the original when someone 'found' my camera case. It works.On this specific cable, everything is done right, including the price. It is USB 2.0 certified, meaning that it supports data transfer rates of up to 480Mbps and, if your device accepts a Micro-B plug, this is the cable to get. Maybe the 2-meter length (6+ ft.) is a little bit too much but it does not bother me a lot and there may come a time when a cable this long may come in handy.I am awarding this item 5 stars for price, quality and, especially, for the very good presentation on Amazon's page.______________________________________________Notes:Anyone in the market for a USB cable should be very careful because there are at least 6 kinds of USB connectors. If you are buying a cable that connects 'something' to your computer or laptop, the computer end of the cable will always be a USB-A or 'Type A' connector. At the other end, you may have a USB-B/Type B - a nearly square shaped connector used mostly to deliver power to a device but this is rare. Most likely, you will have a Mini-B or a Micro-B. The difference between the 2 is that the Micro-B is half as thick while the width is the same - Mini-B is 3x7mm while Micro-B is 1.5x7mm.If your device (phone, PDA, camera) is a 'new' one and it's using USB, chances are that they will need a Micro-B connector because the industry seems to be adopting the 'Micro' form factor as its standard. If the above sounds simple, you should keep in mind that some devices require Mini-AB or Micro-AB connectors, also known as USB OTG (OnTheGo) devices.My advice: before ordering any cable, make sure that you clearly understand what type of cable you need. This Amazon listing and most Cables Unlimited listings are most helpful because the Amazon page gives you a visual of what the connectors look like. Whenever in doubt, do some more research.",5.0,1258416000,"11 17, 2009","BlackBerry USB DataSync and Charging Cable with Micro USB for BlackBerry 8900, 9500, and 8220",2.58,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41OMIQ-LmcL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 14989},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Data Cables']]",1.0

Namely, that some have used it for Blackberries.  That being said, I decided that a couple of bucks was nothing much to lose with my experiment.  On a Samsung Intercept, you'll notice that the micro usb area on the phone is covered by what seems like a flimsy tied on piece of rubber that folds down flat when not using the plug.  When you try to push the micro usb charger or sync plug into the phone, it is a very tight fit and really can't be done (by me) in full dark.

I tried it out immediately by plugging it into the USB port on my PC at my desk at work, then into my BlackBerry Style 9670.  The USB Port/PC instantly recognized the phone as a ""BlackBerry Device"" and began charging it, same as my OEM cable.  I'm not going to use it as a data sync cable, but only as a back-up charger, and it works perfectly so far.  It's a bit of a thinner gauge compared to the original OEM cable that came with my phone, but at the same time is much more flexible and pliable.  It is NOT BlackBerry branded (but wasn't expected to be based on the description), and is quite a bit shorter than described.  Amazon states 3.9 feet.  I don't have a tape measure with me, but placed side by side with the OEM cable, it's about 18 inches shorter.  No problem for me.  That actually works out better because I only need maybe 2 feet to charge my phone at work.  If you're looking for a longer cable, you might want to look into a different one though.

Though the label on the battery says it is for the Storm, both the Bold and the Storm uses the same battery, so no worries.  It shipped in a small plastic bag (with two other batteries I purchased for other phones), and the batteries were in a padded larger envelope.  At first, I was not sure what to expect from this battery.  However, I was not dissapointed.  After charging overnight, the battery held a charge under a normal day's use using the phone for calls, texting, music, and data-intensive web browsing and email.  The battery indicator showed I only used half the battery's charge (which is on par with the original battery).  I switched batteries when the charge ran empty, and after using it for several weeks (alternating batteries after complete discharge) I cannot tell which battery was the original and which is the backup.  I labelled the backup battery (this review) with ""OEM"" to discern the difference.A colleague lent me herBlackBerry Micro USB Extra Battery Charger (D-Series), which is a great add-on to charge (and carry) a spare battery.  It seems highly recommended to completely discharge a battery prior to recharging (though this can be debated).  Having this spare charger will allow me to use up all the battery power of one battery, pop on the fully-charged battery, and charge the spent battery.I did not encounter any problems reported by other reviewers.  The vendor is BTO, Inc.  For 25% (or less) the cost of retail, I would buy this battery and other batteries from this seller again.(BTW, the other two batteries were also functional and able to hold a charge.  I replaced the original batteries of two other phones that could not even hold a charge for half a day.

The complaints that I have with this headphones is mostly the lack of bass and that the lapel clip keeps coming off.  Before this I was using the Sony h.ear earphones with my Bold 9700 to listen to the music stored which which to me was not a high baseline of comparison.  The call quality is ok but I wish RIM fixes the ringing issue on all their Blackberry devices when using any headset and not just mutes the music if an incoming call comes in which causes miscalls.The other accessories are a plus especially the case but I haven't had the need to swap out the other parts that came with it.  The right-angle connector is again a plus but feels that it sticks out farther than I'm accustomed to.  The gun-metal highlights on the headphones are a plus.

Giving up the music, podcasts, podiobooks and handsfree phone use is NOT an option - I work outside with horses several hours a day - gotta have my media! The set of earbuds that came with the phone worked well, but my ears a tad small and they were just too big. Plus the hard metal & plastic literally caused a painful bruise on one ear. After tons of research I decided on these for several reasons. As it turns out these are very good both with regard to sound and actual daily functionality.They are a Blackberry product thus compatible with my phone. They have a microphone and a remote control with the volume, skip and pause on the cord - no need to remove the phone from your holster or pocket! All these buttons worked properly as soon as the headset was plugged into my phone. (No learning curve or difficulty with the new Blackberry OS.6) One note on the remote control - there is a 2 second delay from the time you initiate a command before the phone reacts. If you have voice dialing set up on your Torch it can work with this headset and that is very nice. Sound quality is good with simple voice narration from an audio book. The sound is very good with actual music - in fact this headset is louder than the original, which means I no longer have to keep the volume at it's highest level. Additionally, if you click the options in the BB menu on your phone, you can adjust the sound to reflect the type of music you're listening to and this headset does reflect the change. The carrying case is hard and fits well in a purse or the center console of the car. But most importantly the ear buds are size adjustable with the three different size tips included. The multiple options are easy to change out and since one of my ears is slightly smaller than the other I can put a small tip on the left and a medium tip on the right side - NO MORE PAIN!!I like these so much I am considering buying another set for travel.*************Jan 2012 UPDATE ***********************After almost a full year of regular use, these headphones are working just fine with no issues at all.

The sides wrap slightly around the front and makes using the keyboard a challenge, especially when trying to use the bottom corner keys like enter or shift (Look at the picture carefully, you'll see it's cut out to get as close as possible to the keys, I didn't notice that when before I purchased, but the picture is accurate). The cut outs are right where they need to be for the side buttons and charger/headphone jacks though, and this does what it's supposed to do as far as protecting the device. However, I use the keyboard much too often to continue with this cover. I'm buying a replacement after 2 days of use of this cover.

Other skins/cases look a little bit like an eye sore. Only problem I had was not being able to charge it on my cradle with the skin on. I had to make my own cut outs to make it work. I have to squeeze in to the cradle to make sure it comes in contact with the charging ends. Before I had to remove the skin but now with my own cutouts everything works.

I am happy Blackberry designed a simple, sleek and resonably priced charging cradle. It uses your esisting wall charger, which plugs into the back and it has contacts that connect to the blackberry so there's no cord to plug into the side. It's made of plastic but seems reasonably study and is just heavy enough so that it grips the desk and doesn't slide all over the desk if the cord is moved.My only complaint is that it could hold the blackberry a little more firmly. If you touch the blackberry or try to use it while in the cradle, it will move on and off the contacts. Each time it makes contact again it goes into 'clock mode' so this makes it pretty impossible to use it while its in the cradle. You have to take it completely out of the cradle to use it.

B002HJ9RRY,A3NEAETOSXDBOM,Stephen M. Charme,"[1, 1]","This product looks nice and is a very easy way for me to keep my BlackBerry Tour charged all the time at work and home (I bought two). It takes up very little space on my desk, and provides easy access to my Tour since it lifts right out of the Pod. This is so much more convenient than attaching my Tour to the included charging cable, then detaching it to use it, then re-attaching it after I am done, and then repeating the process all over again the next time that I use it.The Pod charges the Tour by plugging a charger into the base of the Pod, and then having the metal contacts on the back of the Tour come into contact with the contacts on the Pod. There is nothing to connect, such as when you dock an iPod and have to make sure the port on the bottom attaches to the pin connector on the dock. Therefore it's very quick and simple to take my Tour out of the Pod to answer a call or check an email, and then replace it.Note: 1. Since you cannot dock your Tour in the Pod without removing any case, it is not practical to use a wraparound case. I use a pocket case which, unlike a wraparound case, can be quickly and easily removed.2. To use the BlackBerry desktop software on a PC, you need to remove the Tour from the Pod and connect it to the PC with a USB cable. As another review notes, the Pod does not connect the Tour to your PC.

Its sleek and easy to navigate..Before I had this one I had the 8120, ah--big difference the charge on 8520 last longer and takes a little time to charge up, but its worth it. Also, the keys I wished lighted up a bit brighter, BUT like I said once you have it after a few days you get used to it.

The 2gb memory card that comes with it I took out and put in my 4gb from my 8120 in it. I read somewhere it can go to 16gb and pretty soon it will go 34gb...its in the works now.I will say the quality in web browsing is GREAT and I have had no problems with dropped calls, lost signal, or getting frustrated with where are the keys for texting; all the numbers are on the left side..feels weird but after a day or so, it works better than my other blkberry which was the 8120.Also there's a dictionary to while your texting, a firewall..it is just way better than I expected.

B002YDZSQM,A27XZ2EQ8VUT7Y,AAlt,"[44, 46]","I have been using this phone for about a week now. And while this device beats previous bold 9000 in many aspects there is still much to be improved. So let me first say things that I do like about the phone. Of course the greatest improvement was the addition of the trackpad, at first it was kind of unusual to navigate with it but I got accustomed to it very quickly. Second thing is the screen resolution, it was improved from the old bold by 480x360 vs 480x320 pixels. The screen is really crisp and bright and sunlight legibility is very decent. The camera also experienced an improvement and while I was taking pictures outside on a bright day and later comparing them to the previous bold, there is a very noticeable change, pictures look somewhat close to my wife's 10 megapixel canon camera. I was also surprised by the improved quality of the videos this device shoots. Much better and less pixelated  than the original bold! Now for the things that I don't like or wished to be improved. Despite of the fact that everyone raves about ""amazing"" battery life on this device, I must say I am disappointed. At best, the battery lasts me a day and a half but not two day as many reviewers say. Perhaps I do extensive web browsing and chatting via instant messaging. I usually like to read various blogs and news on opera mini 5 browser and I noticed that this application along with IM+ drains battery like crazy! Of course at least now I don't have to carry a spare battery with me like it was with the previous bold since I am sure this one will last me for the full day.  But most often I still have to charge it every night. Which is kind of a disappointment and not what I expected after reading various reviews. Now about the browser: It sucks.... It simply sucks so much that any other smartphone's browser will put it to shame. But another annoying problem now that I noticed is that I can't get to mobile version of citibank online at all! No matter how I would reconfigure the browser... So it means no banking online for me as I used to do on my previous bold. Very annoying... The browser is still slow as hell  and only the fact that I have opera on this phone doesn't make it a deal breaker. I must say though that I am running a latest .405 version of the software and perhaps the issue with banking online maybe be fixed in later versions. Which I again, doubt very much. Now another disappointment is the absence of many supported languages. For example there is no Russian support whatsoever. But than again, it may be released in the later versions. I hope so. And now last but not least is the speaker quality. In the first day of use I noticed that the speaker has been  downgraded. Instead of the three speakers which previous bold had, this device has only one and when you bring the volume all the way up you can hear a rattling noise. Not a very nice experience... Overall I like the device especially it's size, I was skeptical about it as I liked the bold 9000 big screen. But this one seems to be slim and looks more eye appealing. Also I like the battery cover design, you can not accidentally open it and whole device seems sturdy and has a look of a professional tool. Hopefully with next updates there will be support for more languages. But as of now I am giving it only 3 stars.UPDATE:Couple of weeks ago I noticed that phone would randomly delete data, but today was the worst: In the morning I discovered that all my contacts were completely wiped out!!! by itself! And when I tried to restore them from the backup file it would not do that saying that the file is read only. I tried this file in my old curve 8310 and it worked flawlessly. So I suspect that there are serious bugs in the OS 5.0 and AT&T; is not coming up with any updates as of yet. In a mean time I am lowering score for this phone because I am very disappointed by the poor implementationUPDATE 2:As five months passed since I got this phone, I must admit I like it much more than I did before. True, I still have some issues with it, but these issues are just too minor comparing to lots of useful features that this device delivers. Previously I wrote that it deleted all my contacts from the phone book, and last week it just happened again but I noticed that it happened after I added an another gmail account to the phone. So after I gooogled a bit I found out that gmail actually will sync your contacts with your gmail account but for some unknown reason remove them from the phone book. So basically all you have to do is to download google sync on your phone and transfer contacts back to the phone book. So I tend to believe that this issue has more to do with google gmail setup rather than the phone itself. Also the issue with the Citibank mobile site have resolved mysteriously, and now I am able to do banking through the native browser (which still sucks by the way in many aspects) I am also looking forward to the release of OS 6.0 which should include webkit browser with flash support and other new and exciting features. So I must say that ever since I got this phone it never crashed or restarted on me, not even a single time. So I must increase the rating of the phone to 4 stars as it's been a really great tool which I certainly can rely on in terms of usability and trust.",4.0,1263945600,"01 20, 2010",BlackBerry Bold 9700 - Smartphone - 3G - WCDMA (UMTS) / GSM - QWERTY - BlackBerry OS - black,121.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZvTxZd4wL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 24240},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0
B002YDZSQM,ADLVFFE4VBT8,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[3, 3]","Any current Blackberry user should be happy and possibly happier with the 9700 if upgrading from a previous model. When it comes to new users, it's a crowded marketplace out there. Those who prefer great physical keyboards may want to look into the current Blackberries. I got this company-issued Bold a couple of months ago through my employer to replace my old 8830. As a Blackberry user for more than 10 years now, I am quite happy with what I got and I see many improvements over what used to be a standard-issue Blackberry some 2-3 years ago.First, the good things about the 9700 Bold:- IT'S STILL A BLACKBERRY - This is important to the many BB users who want their Blackberry to change only slightly from one generation to another, at least as far as the physical form and the user interface is concerned. While Blackberries evolved from the little 'wheel' to the track ball to the current touch-sensitive square that's replacing it, they are still recognizable and I bet that if a time traveler from, let's say, 2002, popped up in 2010, he/she should be able to use the 9700 in no time. All buttons are at the familiar locations and, at least when comparing it with the previous generation, the 9700 responds very much in the same way.- IT'S SMALLER, LIGHTER - While the screen appears to be (very slightly) larger on the 9700, it's bulk is significantly reduced. The 9700 is thinner and it weighs a lot less than its predecessor. Not everyone may appreciate this in the beginning and I was one of those but I got used with the lighter device quickly and I would consider it an improvement now.- IMPROVED PICTURE QUALITY - While not the best screen in business, the picture on the 9700 is significantly better as far as resolution when compared to previous models. I would not use the Bold to watch movies or read books with the Kindle application but... this is a Blackberry and it's good at doing what Blackberries are expected to do: email, voice, enterprise integration. Everything else I see as 'extras'.- EXTRAS - Of course, you get a camera which I'm not likely to use but it's good to know it's there, you can get video for free or subscribe to some pay service, have the ability to store various media and so on. It's good to have them but I'm not likely to spend much time with the 'extras' except maybe for the Web browser.- IMPROVED WEB BROWSER - This is good news. The built-in browser is not quite as good as, let's say, Opera but it's coming pretty close and it's a major improvement over what Blackberry used to offer. And you can always install Opera or some other browser.- 3G - Of course. EDGE is still available as the fall back service but, whenever 3G is detected, the 9700 will take advantage of it.- BLUETOOTH, WI-FI - they work great and pairing with a Bluetooth device can be done literally in seconds.In addition to the above, on the 'the same' or not necessarily 'improvements' category, I noticed no significant change as far as battery life is concerned. The 9700 needs (and comes with a) MICRO USB power adapter so the old MINI USBs won't work on this model. You also get the official Blackberry black leather case with a belt clip.On the not-so-good or 'really annoying' side, I really hated the abundance of bloatware - I call it 'crapware' - that seems to have invaded the Blackberry world. There is an abundance of little pre-installed apps and services that, shortly after you click on and go to the trouble of activating them, it turns out that they are 'pay' things, ranging from Pac-Man to TV services, and it's either impossible or very difficult to remove - I didn't have the time to waste so I was able to quickly hide them but... there SO MANY of them. If Research in Motion is listening, they should know that I do NOT love Blackberry more for turning the BB desktop into some apps and services peddling space.Still on the 'not-so-good' but this could be only an isolated instance, my first 9700 was dead on arrival but I was able to get a replacement quickly and this one works well.When it comes to rating the Bold 9700, within the context of Blackberries, it's probably one of the best. It's lighter, brighter, sharper, faster and provides more functionality than previous models so it's a five-star.",5.0,1278979200,"07 13, 2010",BlackBerry Bold 9700 - Smartphone - 3G - WCDMA (UMTS) / GSM - QWERTY - BlackBerry OS - black,121.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZvTxZd4wL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 24240},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0

B002YDZSQM,A307MXMO2ER64W,"Honest ""Truthful""","[3, 10]","I bought this phone unlocked so I wouldn't have to pay the monthly data plan to my carrier, however, I noticed that just by using the wifi to connect to the internet I was having few critical problems that my iPhone didn't have.  Here's what I encountered, some of the web pages weren't being opened and others did.  The ones that weren't being opened just gave me a blank page and stalled then I tried going to Yahoo site and it opened to that page without any problems??!!  You might think it was just a fluke or that page I tried opening was a non-active site but I can assure you that I tried with many other sites and it also gave me that same problems.  And then there were other sites that would open but only uses half of the screen so that it made it difficult to read due to the smallness of the images. This problem didn't exist with the other older model wide screen Blackberry with track ball.  Another critical flaw is that the email accounts doesn't work and it wouldn't allow you to create any email accounts.  I believe this is due to the fact that since Blackberry has their own server for the emails and if you have no data plan the Blackberry somehow doesn't allow you to connect to their site.  So the only way you can check your email is by using wifi to access your email account website such as Yahoo, Gmail, Hotmail and etc.  But then again you would encounter the site either it's going to open up or not as I mentioned from above, so it becomes hit or a miss every time you are trying to access some website.  I have an older iPhone and so I wanted to get a newer smart phone and wanted to try out Blackberry since I heard so much about how great their emails and such but if you can't access it then it becomes no better than a dumb phone.  So to pay all that money to get this phone was a waste.  My only suggestion is that if you want to get this phone then make sure you have a data plan otherwise you'll be having all problems I mentioned.  But then again, there are sites I mentioned that it would only uses half of the screen so it would be difficult in trying to read the words or viewing the images.  I would just stay away from this phone completely because there are so many other unlocked smart phones without all these problems I mentioned and probably costs much less than this one.",1.0,1264464000,"01 26, 2010",BlackBerry Bold 9700 - Smartphone - 3G - WCDMA (UMTS) / GSM - QWERTY - BlackBerry OS - black,121.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZvTxZd4wL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 24240},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",-1.0

B002YDZSQM,AMLDT3RMN9BS8,"Quentin Gerlach ""IT Guy""","[141, 146]","Alright, let me just say off the bat that as a former Bold 9000 user, I've been looking forward to the new Bold 2 for months since pictures were leaked on the internet. Since I get my phones through my company, I've had the phone since Nov. 18, when it was released on AT&T;'s network for Premier people.  Unfortunately, my friend decided that after playing around with my phone, they wanted one, so I bought them an unlocked one.The new Bold 9700 is a sleek phone - no doubt about it. RIM apparently has decided, though, to somewhat standardize their phones' look, a direction that bothers me to a great extent. One of the things I loved about the Bold was that it was different - you saw any other phone, and then you saw the Bold - and you thought ""Wow, that phone IS bold!!"" Size I couldn't care less about - as long as it looked good, and worked awesomely, what else matters? And the Bold 9000 fit those well. So when I got the new 9700, and I compared it to my coworker's Tour (for Verizon), I was quite surprised at how similar they were. It's actually somewhat hard to tell them apart (the 9700 is a bit smaller, and also has the trackpad). Just an observation....Alright - to the review:Pros:Trackpad - this is definitely a most welcome upgrade. RIM outdid themselves on this part - I thought the trackball was good, this trackpad is great! The older Bold's trackball was great, as long as you kept dirt and dust out of it. Which turned out to be somewhat difficult, since there was a depression surrounding the trackball, and so if too much dust or dirt got in, the ball needed to be replaced. Also, if you used it too much, the ball would lose its grip, and become less responsive, also - once again - needing to be replaced. Both those problems are now gone with this new trackpad. For former trackball users, it may take a little use to get to know it, but once you do, trust me - you'll never go back.Speaker - the speakers on the Bold are nothing less than stunning. My friend has an IPhone, and my speakers for playing music and speakerphone blow his out of this century. Not only can they get very loud, but they also are quite clear and crisp, for the volume you can put them to. And, if that wasn't good enough, RIM includes AudioBoost - for when you hook your Bold up to your car or stereo system, which bumps the output sound even higher. Excellent....OS - the new BlackBerry 5 OS, which comes preloaded on the phone, is a major improvement over the 4.6 version in most other phones. It's snappier, and quite more responsive.Camera - RIM upgraded the camera from a 2 MP in the older Bold to a 3.2 MP in the Bold 9700. The pictures that the phone takes are quite good, even in poor light conditions. Of course, if you try to take pictures in the club with it - prepare to be somewhat disappointed. Ha. But for regular, everyday camera uses, that ""quick shot"", the Bold 9700 actually takes decent pictures. Nice for when you forget to bring that digital camera with you.There's a couple other pros I can think of, but they're more along the lines of business users, or based on networks (you could get 3G speeds on AT&T;'s network since the first Bold - T-Mobile just got their first 3G BlackBerry with this phone). If you're interested in them, drop me a comment, and I'll get back to you.Now, for the cons:Battery - battery life is still somewhat bad, although it definitely is an improvement over the older Bold. I normally use Pandora - an App that plays Internet Radio, trust me, this should be one of the first apps you download, it's free - the other is Google Maps, also free - anyway, back to the review, so I normally use Pandora, and I can get about 6 hours out of the battery, with small breaks in-between receiving phone calls. So, in normal use, you could probably get about a day out of the battery, which isn't terrible, but also is somewhat worse than comparable phones out there.Hardware - this is probably my biggest negative I had. Normally, when they say upgrade, you would think they would put better hardware in the thing, right?? Well, think again. With the exception of the upgraded camera and trackpad, there is NO difference in hardware between this and the older Bold.Zero.Nada.I would've liked some upgraded hardware in the phone. But again - this is just my thing. You may not care.My last negative is more hit and miss - some people have been reporting that BlackBerry Maps - the app that RIM ships with the phone for navigation, doesn't work on the 9700. Myself included. This appears to be at random, but it just irks me.  It may be dependent on the network you're on. Fortunately, there's a workaround - get Google Maps.So - overall, the phone is a nice update. It works, takes nice pictures, looks sleek, and can be used as your new boombox when you want to blast ""What is Love?"" by Haddaway. (Kidding on the last one) I would completely recommend this phone, even with some of its faults, since they don't really take away from the experience with the phone.I'll update this review from time to time, as I continue to use this, so if there's any questions, please feel free to ask.UPDATE:  As of today - 8/3/2010 - RIM has announced that their new BlackBerry OS - 6 - WILL be compatible with the 9700.  So if you are looking at this phone, but aren't necessarily a fan of OS 5, or weren't sure if updates would be released for it - fear no more.UPDATE 2:  Today, 1/26/2011 - RIM has still not released the OS 6 for this phone yet, which is just BS.  I included a link for those of you who are feeling dangerous and don't mind using beta software, so here you go - [...]  Remember - it is a beta, so some things might be different, but I didn't notice any less functionality.",4.0,1260230400,"12 8, 2009",BlackBerry Bold 9700 - Smartphone - 3G - WCDMA (UMTS) / GSM - QWERTY - BlackBerry OS - black,121.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZvTxZd4wL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 24240},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0

B0030T0UHQ,A1YAWI5760ZHNU,Doug,"[0, 0]","Though I am leaving the BlackBerry ecosystem in a few months (after having a BB for the last 7+ years), my almost two year old BB Bold 9650 was resetting by itself ALL the time. If I rebooted the phone (when it locked up on me), the battery would be dead (or 2% left) when the phone came back up. Browsing Twitter or news-feeds or email or any program, always resulted in the phone resetting by itself (and a dead phone). I had, at the most, 20 minutes of talk time, before my phone died on me. This became downright embarrassing. I simply could not use the phone. So, needing a phone that worked for two months, before I jumped the Blackberry ship, I figured I would try this battery.No more automatic resets. I can view my news-feeds for as long as I like, and talk time is no longer a problem. This is all I wanted -- a workable phone to get me to the end of my contract. Too bad RIM dragged their feet so long with BlackBerry 10. RIM lost me as a customer because of their inability to get a quality and competitive phone to the market (in a reasonable amount of time).UPDATE: November 16, 2012I purchased this battery 60 days ago and though it worked just fine for me when I purchased it from Amazon, I'm lucky if I get two (maybe three) hours out a single charge now.

B003XKJ47E,ADLVFFE4VBT8,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[0, 0]","The new design for a Blackberry charger is small and it looks pretty but it has one notable design/functional flaw which should be considered when shopping for an additional Blackberry (or generic) USB charger.Briefly, the slot where the USB cable plugs in is on the side rather than on top - like the official Kindle USB charger - or in front. Therefore, if you want to plug it into a power strip it's mandatory that it's plugged on the last outlet, either on the left or on the right because there would be no room for the USB cable otherwise. Another issue - don't know if it's a problem - is that the plug is not grounded (2-pronged plug) but the makers of Blackberry apparently have concluded that this should be okay and my Blackberries and everything else I charged on it survived so far.Anyone who can live with the above should find the adapter as good as any other USB charger. Here are its good features, besides 'pretty':- Compact - up until recently, chargers used to be extra-wide and sometimes prevented the use of outlets to their left or right on a power strip. This one is the right size, for as long as it's the last one on the left or on the right.- Generic (universal) - it can be used to charge just about any Blackberry and many other gadgets that charge through a Micro or a Mini USB port - I am using it with a Kindle and a couple of Bluetooth headsets and MP3 players. Note that the reverse is also true. I am routinely charging my Blackberries (currently have a Bold and a Torch) off the Kindle charger and everything else can be charged with the Bold's 'old school' big charger.- Modular - like Kindle's charger, this one will work with any Type A male to Micro-B or Mini USB male cable.- Inexpensive - for a 'branded' charger. There are lots of one-dollar generic USB chargers around but you always take a gamble with those and Kindle's own is a little more expensive.To conclude, if one concern is 'power strip clutter' and price doesn't matter, the best USB charger is Kindle's. If price and quality are the main concerns, this may very well be 'the one' to get. Or, if you have some older charger lying around and you don't mind 'older' you may not need this at all.Remember, you will probably need to supply your own USB cable or look for the version that comes with the cable included.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;",4.0,1309996800,"07 7, 2011",RIM USB Power Plug - Charger - Retail Packaging - Black,5.63,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41vkfMuvbWL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 104196},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Travel Chargers']]",1.0

B003YHOXFY,A2Y4N0IFVNNP46,"R Rated ""Keeping it real""","[4, 6]","I have the need for two cell phones, one for business, the other for personal use.  As a result, I can compare the Blackberry Storm 2 from Verizon and the Blackberry Bold 9700 from T-Mobile.  Similar phones in many respects with shared capabilities in the main but one is far more user friendly than the other in my opionion.  The Bold is the friendlier one by far.  As an aside, I am impressed by the level of service and follow-up by Verizon and the Storm 2 over T-Mobile but that's another issue for another time.The Storm 2 is quirky.  Maybe the same can be said of all touch screen devices but it tends to lock up, accept the wrong commands and is tough to navigate with those smallish querty keyboard symbols.  And you have to toggle between screens to add numerical data and certain punctuation marks to your text.  The Bold, in comparison, is not like typing on a regular keyboard either but it does allow for easy fixing of typos and with its chicklet fixed keyboard makes navigating a far easier task.And that's the main difference between the Bold and Storm 2:  Ease of navigation.  It's sort of like going from the original version of Windows (Storm 2) to Windows 7 (Bold 9700) if you follow my drift? The Storm 2 does have an advantage in the user being able to go from portrait to landscape mode which helps a little on typing text but even then, the keyboard is not forgiving.  The Storm 2 now has four sensor modules under the screen to help on the commands which is a step up over the ONE from the original Storm but stability is hardly the order of the day.Sending a text requires an additional menu call-up on the Storm 2 as opposed to the Bold. Also, on the Storm 2, one has to dig into the media icon to access the video camera.  Not so on the Bold.  More examples outlining the differences between the two phones.  In summation, I like both phones but the Bold would be my choice if I could only have one phone.  I think the Storm 2 has another generational change ahead of it before it can lay claim to being a true iphone alternative.You have to think the people at RIM and Blackberry are acutely aware of the Storm 2's issues because the phone is just short of being an all around excellent choice.  Right now the Storm 2 is a GOOD choice and I'll leave it there.UPDATE:  After many dropped calls in spite of good wi-fi or antenna 3G strength indicated, and having the Storm lock up on me after taking it from the charger, I couldn't continue and got out of it and the contract.  I'm beginning to think the folks at Blackberry and RIM have been not only passed but left in the dust by the competition.  To be fair, the Bold 9700 has been and still is a solid unit which I have no desire to replace.

This is because, unlike BlackBerry cases made before 2010, it is not all leather. Rather, it consists of layers of cardboard with a very thin, embossed leather shell attached on the outside and a microfiber lining attached on the inside.When I say ""attached"" I mean that it can also become ""unattached"" -- and indeed it does. If you use this on a daily basis, I guarantee that within six months (tops), you will see the layers of that cardboard interior as the leather and/or lining peel away.The top stitching (either the red stitch or the top of the black stitching on the other side) also develops a loose thread look.I originally bought one of these for the 9800, and kept using it despite the interior coming apart. I bought a second one when I purchased the 9810 in August 2011. Now, less than six months later -- just like the first one -- it's coming apart. And the red stitch has developed the loose thread look (I had the same problem with the black and cauterized it with the judicious application of a lighter flame, but I'm not sure I want to do that with the red stitching).I've lightly applied glue to the cardboard inside, but that stiffens the case up. I probably should have tried a spray microadhesive or the like, but for not much more than the cost of buying such a spray, I could get a new one of these.Which I will probably do.

B00474VU72,ADLVFFE4VBT8,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[0, 0]","The new design for a Blackberry charger is small and it looks pretty but it has one notable design/functional flaw which should be considered when shopping for an additional Blackberry (or generic) USB charger.Briefly, the slot where the USB cable plugs in is on the side rather than on top - like the official Kindle USB charger - or in front. Therefore, if you want to plug it into a power strip it's mandatory that it's plugged on the last outlet, either on the left or on the right because there would be no room for the USB cable otherwise. Another issue - don't know if it's a problem - is that the plug is not grounded (2-pronged plug) but the makers of Blackberry apparently have concluded that this should be okay and my Blackberries and everything else I charged on it survived so far.Anyone who can live with the above should find the adapter as good as any other USB charger. Here are its good features, besides 'pretty':- Small - up until recently, chargers used to be extra-wide and sometimes prevented the use of outlets to their left or right on a power strip. This one is the right size, for as long as it's the last one on the left or on the right.- Generic (universal) - it can be used to charge just about any Blackberry and many other gadgets that charge through a Micro or a Mini USB port - I am using it with a Kindle and a couple of Bluetooth headsets and MP3 players. Note that the reverse is also true. I am routinely charging my Blackberries (currently have a Bold and a Torch) off the Kindle charger and everything else can be charged with the Bold's 'old school' big charger.- Modular - like Kindle's charger, this one will work with any Type A male to Micro-B or Mini USB male cable.- Inexpensive - for a 'branded' charger. There are lots of one-dollar generic USB chargers around but you always take a gamble with those and Kindle's own is a little more expensive.To conclude, if one concern is 'power strip clutter' and price doesn't matter, the best USB charger is Kindle's. If price and quality are the main concerns, this may very well be 'the one' to get. Or, if you have some older charger lying around and you don't mind 'older' you may not need this at all.Remember, you will need to supply your own USB cable or look for the version that comes with the cable included.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;",4.0,1309996800,"07 7, 2011",Blackberry USB AC Charger Adapter Power Plug for Blackberry Torch 9800 Bold 9700 Style 9670 Bold 9650 Tour 9630 Storm2 9550 9520 Storm 9500 9530,4.85,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BV1sByVFL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 53042},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Travel Chargers']]",1.0

But he never listened to music so he never took them out of the box. About a month before I finally got my smartphone (Galaxy S3!) I was looking at the box and found these. They are pretty sweet headphones. The listening quality is pretty solid, although a true audiophile might find them to be slightly lacking. I listen to a lot of music, primarily Rap and R&B;, but I didn't find any issue with the sound. These are great at staying in my ears and they don't really fall out unless they're yanked or something like that.I only have 2 issues.1.) These don't have a volume button. It has a pause button, but no volume buttons. That does bug me a lot. I'd prefer to be able to adjust the volume from the headphones instead of having to take out my phone and adjust the volume from the side.2.) After about 2-3 months of usage, these headphones became stuck in my phone. I was scared about taking them out of my new phone for the fear of damaging it, so I left them in there for about a week. It was getting really annoying, so I decided to use pliers to forcefully take them out. It worked, and there appears to not be any damage to my phone. Crisis averted. It was the adhesive at the end of the headphone jack that wore off, so when it became stuck, it was impossible to remove by hand. Problem is now that when using the headphones, I have to adjust the headphone jack angle so that both earbuds have sound come out.

I am delighted that it worked with AT&T; 3G bands.I must say that I missed the keypad and it's been a wonder and huge relief to have physical feel on the typing, certain very assuring feel.  Also Blackberry 6 is definitely a nice update (device not supported by Blackberry 7) and a huge difference from my old Curve back in Feb  2009 when I last had it.  The menus and executions are fast and the aesthetics of the OS are polished--pleasing if that is what others would say although I didn't load it up with tons of apps as it is only a temporary device.  It has Vlingo - Siri's BB counterpart, not as intelligent as Siri but does the job.  I don't do socials very much so I didn't care about FB, Tweeter and social feeds although its got a unified social feed status.The track pad is very responsive, unless your finger is wet or oily, then you need more skin traction.The Blackberry Desktop for Mac is one that i love very much.  My Mac address book (not icloud, local address book), and calendar entries synced without a glitch.Keypad is still here to stay I guess.Just some thoughts about setting up BIS and for those with $30 Data Unlimited iPhone Plan:I initially had problem setting up the BIS because the device is not recognized by the network as this unit from Amazon is unlocked.  I called AT&T; and reported the IMEI and PIN of the device, rebooted and everything went well, including setting up my AOL email account on the BIS from the phone (does not allow you to setup BIS through your Mac or PC browser--very strange).  My $30 Data Unlimited iPhone plan which I had since Feb 2009 was converted to same $30 Data Unlimited Blackberry plan.

I had originally purchased the charger to charge a device that needed 1+ amp to work properly but have not been using it recently. I dedicated the charger for use with my Galaxy S3 over the stock charger supplied with the phone. The higher charge rate, though not considerably faster, certainly charges the phone in about 3/4 the time the stock charger does.Surprisingly, the attached cord is a welcome change from the now standard 2 piece usb cord setup. The cord is longer and thinner than every usb to micro usb cable I own and the build quality is great. The micro usb plug fits tight inside the phone but does not take excessive force to remove. The only con that one may see in this charger is the size of the plug however if you are used to any normal wall wart this will fit right in with the others.The folding portion seems sturdy and has come in handy when travelling.

I remember using it for my BlackBerry smartphone too just because it made my life easier.Now I'm ordering again but for my Kindle Fire HD this time because I know this thing works and I'm not exactly trying to pay for that powerfast kindle charger.Update 2013-01-21:I've been using it for a bit now and it still lives up to my expectations. It charges fast and it actually works pretty well for my Kindle Fire HD. A regular charger wouldn't even work on charging my Kindle Fire HD, but this one works. Also, I like how it came with the authentic BlackBerry packaging, so I didn't have to worry about it being fake or what not. One thing I should mention, however, is that the first few times I plugged in the charger to any microUSB charging port (BlackBerry Bold 9900, Kindle Fire HD 8.9), it felt a little tight and required a little more push to get it inside; but, after a few days, the charger or the ports seem to have got used to it and now it slips in easier. Also, when taking the charger anywhere, the fact that you can fold the charger makes it easier to carry in a bag or backpack without worrying that it will scratch something. Anyway, VERY FAST charger for smartphones and a good charger for tablets.

B004OZMWUS,A1WEJZEUI3S3EV,John,"[1, 1]","I tested a bunch of chargers with my Samsung Galaxy S3 and the best chargers were the following in this order:#1)  HP Touchpad charger#2)  Blackberry Playbook charger#3)  Asus Nexus 7 charger#4)  Samsung cube charger 1 amp#5)  Samsung oblong charger .7 amps#6)  New Trent wall charger with premium Amazonbasics cord-  This one was the absolute worst and only good for overnight charging.I only measured about a 10% improvement in charger time over the Oblong charger that came with the phone.  However, there are other advantages to the Blackberry Playbook charger which are a six foot cord and the usb cord cannot be detached from the plug.  The fact that it cannot be detached is an advantage because oftentimes the cord and plug separate while traveling/handling.Out of all the chargers I tested I made the HP Touchpad charger my home always in the wall charger.  However, the Blackberry charger goes into my computer bag while I travel.  That extra foot or so on the cord is invaluable and since the cord cannot separate from the base there is no issues with a lost plug or cord.  Oftentimes, one or the other gets lost from handling and traveling around.  That wont happen with this plug.Please note all phones are different and so you may get different results with your particular device.

B0058GWR8O,ADLVFFE4VBT8,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[20, 24]","I will state right in the beginning my view that Blackberries continue to be the leaders when it comes to security, data efficiency, reliability and and practicality. My company-issued Blackberry does not do games very well and I'm not using it to play movies (I prefer the 73"" screen in the living room for that) but it's amazingly good when it comes to getting my email and quickly composing new messages or replying to the incoming. Also great at integrating the enterprise email with any Web email services I'm using, Bluetooth-paired devices and the phone features be they 4G or Wi-Fi.Current Bold users should be happy and almost certainly happier with the 9930 because this is very much the 'old' Bold only sleeker, faster or, in other words... bolder. When it comes to new users, it's a crowded marketplace out there. Those who prefer great physical keyboards may want to look into this Bold because you could hardly find a better 'phone' keyboard anywhere and that includes other Blackberries. I am currently a Torch user but I've been given the opportunity to try out a couple of the newer models: this new Bold and the new Torch 9810. The Torch has a slightly larger screen but, in fairness, few phones come close to the new Bold when the factors considered are elegance, the quality of the build and, naturally, the keyboard.First, the good things:- IT'S STILL A BLACKBERRY - This is important to the many BB users who want their Blackberry to change only slightly from one generation to another, at least as far as the physical form and the user interface is concerned. While Blackberries evolved from the little 'wheel' to the track ball to the current touch-sensitive pad to touch screens, they are still recognizable and I bet that if a time traveler from, let's say, 2002, popped up in 2011, he/she should be able to use the 9930 in no time. All buttons are at the familiar locations and, at least when comparing it with the previous generation, the 9930 responds very much in the same way with 'touch' added if needed but never mandatory to accomplish anything. I find myself using a combination of touch, buttons and sometimes to track pad to operate it.- IT'S SMALLER, LIGHTER - While the screen appears to be (very slightly) larger on the 9930, its bulk is significantly reduced. This model is thinner and it appears to weigh less than its predecessor. Not everyone may appreciate this in the beginning and I was one of those but I got used with the lighter device quickly and I would consider it an improvement now.- TOUCH - Not the first Blackberry with the feature and it's not as good as iPhone's but, for what I'm using it, it's just right. The new Blackberry OS allows me to 'touch' just about anything on the screen and trigger... something. Gestures are also supported including 'pinch-zoom' in and out. And, related...- BUTTONS - Maybe this should have been at the top of the list. This Blackberry does not force me to do everything by touching the screen. Just about everything can be done by either pushing/clicking a button and controlling the cursor with the little trackpad or by interacting directly with the screen (tap virtual buttons) or a combination. Most of the time it's 'a combination' for me and it's always the way I feel most comfortable about doing things. I appreciate the ability to use physical buttons when I want it.- IMPROVED PICTURE QUALITY - Very much on par with what's current 'best in the business', the picture is significantly better as far as brightness and resolution.  I would not use the Bold to watch movies or read books with the Kindle app but this is because I don't use Blackberries that way. I could if I wanted to. To me Blackberries are expected to do: email, voice, enterprise integration. Everything else is 'extras' - my employer wouldn't like to see me watch movies, play games or update my Facebook wall on the company 'phone'.- BETTER KEYBOARD - Believe it or not, this Bold's keyboard is even a better design that the predecessor's. The keys are slightly larger because keys now stretch from edge thus gaining maybe an extra 1/8 of an inch to distribute among the 10 or so keys on each row. I noticed the difference immediately.- EXTRAS - Of course, you get cameras with geolocation which I'm not likely to use a lot but it's good to know it's there, you can get video for free or subscribe to some pay services, have the ability to store various media and so on. It's good to have them but I'm not likely to spend much time with the 'extras' except maybe with the Web browser which, by the way, is very good at handling HTML5.- IMPROVED WEB BROWSER - This is good news. The built-in browser may not be as good as, let's say, Opera but it's coming pretty close and it's a major improvement over what Blackberry used to offer. This one is, of course, touch enabled.- Bluetooth, WI-FI - they work great and pairing with a Bluetooth device can be done literally in seconds.In addition to the above, on the 'the same' or not necessarily 'improvements' category, I noticed no significant change as far as battery life is concerned. Hard to measure it but I would recharge it every couple of days if used for phone/email only and at least daily if a lot of web browsing or video is involved.On the not-so-good or 'really annoying' side, I really hated the abundance of bloatware - I call it 'crapware' - that seems to have invaded the Blackberry world. There is an abundance of little pre-installed apps and services that, shortly after you click on and go to the trouble of activating them, it turns out that they are 'pay' things, ranging from Pac-Man to TV services, and it's either impossible or very difficult to remove - I didn't have the time to waste so I was able to quickly hide them but... there SO MANY of them. If RIM is listening, they should know that I do NOT love Blackberry more for turning the BB desktop into some apps and services peddling space. Blackberry's app store continues to be difficult to navigate, overpriced and quite unattractive.When it comes to rating this new Bold, within the context of Blackberries, it's probably one of the best and I am now hesitating between this and the Torch. It's lighter, brighter, sharper, faster and provides more functionality than previous models so it's a five-star.And, yes. The Blackberry is not an iPhone or an Android. And the reverse happens to be true: iPhones and Androids are not Blackberries. I'm using a Honeycomb tablet for personal entertainment and there is an iPad in our household but what I've been using a Blackberry for 'business' quick, efficient and reliable communications for the past 10+ years.

There are two: While all of them support worldwide GSM bands (900/850/1900/1800), on UTMS (3G) they are dual band, meaning each one will support only 1900 OR 2100Mhz only.T-Mobile works under 2100Mhz. AT&T; branded phones will work on 1900Mhz. This is crucial.  You need to check with your local carriers for a compatible band, THEN buy.All southamerica but Brazil and Venezuela (I think?) support the 1900Mhz frequency, so a t-mobile branded phone wil not work on 3G. You won't have any problems on the 2G band (slower EDGE speeds).The phone is getting a bad reputation because of the seller shipping different phone versions.

Either way, the next thing I left perfectly clear to the buyer was that I needed my cellphone to work on AT&T; 3G+ kind of networks, they assured me it did... What was my second surprise when I start the phone? The darn thing was a T-Mobile branded cellphone, meaning I'm stuck with EDGE in places where I don't have WIFI coverage, and not to mention the signal reception on this thing is TERRIBLE... your signal ends up dropping everywhere you go with medium to low reception, you'll get familiar with the SOS sign on the screen, if you know what I mean.Now back on topic, the cellphone is pretty nice, I'm specially digging the fact that you can have a DUAL-EXPERIENCE (physical keyboard and touch screen). In my own personal case I use it as a secondary cellphone (main is a Samsung Galaxy S4) Though if you are using it as a main cellphone I would recommend getting something with a better value for your money, honestly you are better off with anything else out there on the market.If you plan on buying this cellphone anyway, make extremely sure you don't get it from &#34;Ross Cellular&#34; as they are nothing but a rip off.",1.0,1369785600,"05 29, 2013",BlackBerry Bold 9900 GSM Factory Unlocked Phone - No Warranty (Black),174.89,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51k4e8OPJ5L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3183},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0

Brown,"[0, 0]","Blackberry 9930 Blackberry Bold Touch 9930Definitely the best BlackBerry I have used since 2002 - previously 3 physical keyboard models, and a Storm I and II.  The oldest models were a little too wide; another had keys too close together; and the two Storms were difficult to type on one-handed while walking (offset with the use of Dragon voice).The screen is beautiful and clear, but most news websites are difficult to read without using the zoom feature; and that means more touching to read side-to-side.  I have a BB Playbook, so the website connections are typically handled on that device.  Email and apps work and view perfectly, however.I have downloaded a lot of apps that I find useful, and I am a heavy user of the phone during the day.  So far, the processor and memory have been great and handled the load, and  I have not experienced any crashes or delays in screen turnover.  The Bridge feature, used with the Playbook, has also been great, as the phone can be used as a touchpad and keyboard, which is very handy on train / plane commuting.All of my calls have been clear and reception has been excellent.The ONLY downside is that the battery completely drains before the end of a workday (with bluetooth and wireless active).  Accordingly, I carry an extra battery and a battery charger (7800 mAh), which is more than adequate to get through a day, and the charger covers extended travel by plane for all of my devices.

B005HYU1YE,AS4CM6IQHKUC6,Cougar Alex,"[0, 2]","I currently have this phone and I HATE it. I am waiting for the day that I can upgrade to the new iPhone or android. If you are young, and you don't have a job, or lifestyle that requires you to be constantly sending and or receiving emails, and that only, this is not the phone for you.  On the other hand, if you do need a phone solely for business, and it is more high tech than the old blackberries, than this is the phone for you!What I hate about this phone is that, compared to the androids and iPhone's, there are not many social media outlets, and when I get bored there are no games that I can play. Yes, I am young, and I would like to play a game or two in the middle of a lecture.Games and social Medias are not the only horrible thing about the apps; all of the apps that are compatible with blackberries do not work very well. I once bought a map app, and it was horrible. The connection was slow, and unreliable, and I got lost in a neighborhood. After getting that app I just got the two social media's that I wanted, Twitter and Facebook, which are still very slow, and never returned to the blackberry app store. I can never trust any app to come out of there.Another Con of the phone would be that when you take video's, you cannot send them in any type of message, such as email and text, only straight onto YouTube, which is a horrible setting because you may not have a YouTube account, or may not want your videos to be on the internet.The keyboard. Yes, sure, there is a touch screen, but there is not a keyboard on that touchscreen, and the keyboard that is built onto the phone is tiny. But when trying to type on this; it took me months to learn how to hold the phone correctly. The buttons were made for babies, they are too small, and the only way to get a message to another person is to use the very tip of your thumb nail. If you want a phone that is easier to type, and not have to twist your mind and body to try and send a simple message out, do not get this phone.Another con of this horrible phone is that the internet connection also is horrible. You may have the best connection in the world, and it still won't upload the page, or information you need from the internet because it takes 5 minutes for everything to load. And once everything is loaded and the phone knows what it is doing, the checkers pop up on the screen, which means that the phone is still trying to upload more information from the website. The Wi-Fi connection is horrible. It may speed up some of the internet searching, but ultimately it still take a few minutes, instead of moments for the website to fully upload.Sure, the phone can be great if you are a business person, who only needs a smart phone to send emails quickly and efficiently, but other than that this phone is a piece of crap, and I do not recommend any person to get this phone.",1.0,1359936000,"02 4, 2013","Blackberry Bold Touch 9930 Verizon CDMA GSM Unlocked Phone with Touch Screen, 5MP Camera and Blackberry OS 7 - Unlocked Phone - No Warranty - Black",126.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VwDoPYemL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2935},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",-1.0
B005HYU1YE,A2RFU2WEK9DXMR,Daniel J. Kinem,"[27, 30]","It was contract renewal time, so visions of new phones for myself and my family danced through my head. I'd been pouring over every detail of the droid phones and the iPhone. My 14 year old son asked...""Aren't they running out of things for phones to do?"" I laughed, but then I thought about his question.It's a loaded question and I knew what he was getting at. The silliness of the phone 'pissing contest' with all the youtube videos comparing one to another. The giant screens. Useless gimmicks like `Siri'I decided to stop, take a breath, and decide what I truly needed in a PHONE. I had 160 apps on my Droid and I literally used about 10-15 of those. The rest were part of the 'pissing contest' (""Hey, do you see what my phone can do!? Bro-stache! Voice warping software! 3D games!"")I needed 100% accuracy in texts and emails. Clear phone calls. At least a workdays worth of battery life (10 hours of heavy usage). Contacts and calendar sync with gmail. `To do' list. The ability to handle multiple email accounts, including Exchange. A simple, decent camera. Medical apps like Epocrates. Music apps like Pandora, Shazaam, Slacker radio. Utilities like Evernote, Dropbox. You get the idea. Mostly as a functioning phone, a real phone with organizing tools, but with a few entertainment things.First let me say that it is truly a beautiful phone. Slim, sleek, stunning design. One of the best LOOKING phones ever. The touch screen is vivid, crisp, and clear.Now, about my `needs' from my PHONE.Accuracy. I am a physican at a busy hospital and we communicate with each other EXTENSIVELY via text throughout the day. The main problem I'd had with my Droid Incredible was the virtual keyboard. If I spent an hour a day texting, literally 15 minutes of that time would be erasing incorrect 'auto corrections'. My thumbs will never get smaller, I will always hit the wrong keys on a virtual keyboard. I had several keyboards on the Droid with very sophisticated prediction software, learning the words I used most, etc. It will never be good enough. iPhone keyboard is far worse, with absolutely horrid options for customization. Blackberry 9930 keyboard is the best thing I've ever typed on. I've never used a BB before but I took to it instantly.Instead of BB's stupid Bold commercial showing bicyclists with glow-in-the-dark wheels driving around, they need to show me at the hospital smashing my virtual keyboard phone against the wall....then cut away to me smiling as I discover what typing on a phone can be like. Stunning. If texting, emailing, and accuracy are important to you, don't underestimate this keyboard as it truly separates this phone from anything else available.Clear, loud phone calls. EXCELLENT noise reduction. People hear me and I hear them. Perfect.Battery is decent. BB users are not thrilled because they are spoiled with 2 days of use in their old, slow, no feature phones. This thing is fast, with a brilliant screen, and it needs juice. I am thrilled with it because I come from the land of Droid where you have to charge the phone multiple times per day. It gets me through long days. I bought the extra battery with dual charger from Amazon, but I have not had to use the second battery yet. There's a HUGE extended battery available, but it makes it look nuts. Some people don't mind, but I love the sleek look, so I will never get that.Syncs with gmail, contacts, calendar. Not as smoothly/thoroughly as Droid devices, of course, but it works very well.Multiple email accounts no problem. POP, IMAP, Exchange.LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the camera! It doesn't have `auto focus' it has some sort of way to focus on everything at the same time. Forget what they call it? IT DOES NOT TAKE CLOSE-UP PICTURES WELL! So, if you are buying your phone with a need for close-up photos, this phone will not suit you. The dedicated camera key is soooo convenient. Why is this not on every phone? Fast, clear, fun to take pictures.BB app world has an atrocious set up. It's confusing, some apps are not represented in BB app world, you have to go to the developer web site to get many programs, app world constantly signs you out when you are browsing on the computer, etc. But most of the major apps are available, and they work fine. Everything I need is available. You too will be fine with apps, it will just take a little digging. App world needs some work.OH, one of the things I love the absolute most about this phone is the INSTANT UNIVERSAL SEARCH! Start typing and the phone starts searching your apps, your texts/emails, contacts, etc for matches. You can set it up so it searches just the things you want it to search. It's amazing and it's INSTANT. It's better than iPhone's swipe (that's already an extra step), and type (on the virtual keyboard that sucks), and it includes INSTANT WEB SEARCHES AS YOU TYPE VIA BING!! Amazing. (As an aside, I love google search and I think you can set it to that, but I'm finding Bing's TV commercials are pretty accurate. I'm getting too much irrelevant information on google. Bing is pretty impressive.)I suggest you sit down and write out what you need from your phone. This BB will NEVER beat iPhone and the latest Droids for speed, apps, screen size, gaming. But, it doesn't need to because it's a better PHONE.Love this phone. My wife got the Galaxy Nexus as did one of my sons. My other boy got an iPhone 4S. I feel that my choice is a better actual functioning phone. I LOVE IT. However, I won't win the `pissing contest' as they are downloading the latest 3D Magic 8-ball app.",5.0,1330732800,"03 3, 2012","Blackberry Bold Touch 9930 Verizon CDMA GSM Unlocked Phone with Touch Screen, 5MP Camera and Blackberry OS 7 - Unlocked Phone - No Warranty - Black",126.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VwDoPYemL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2935},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0

I had the Android for two weeks before I couldn't stand it anymore and returned it for this Blackberry. People bash Blackberries all the time but almost none of those people have actually owned a Blackberry. No, Blackberries are not great for web browsing or apps, this is true. BUT they are great for email, which is 90% of what I do on my phone. I can't imagine a better keyboard than the BB. Features like holding down a letter to capitalize, shortcut keys to find a particular email, sound profiles so only one or two email boxes vibrate/ring while the others stay silent.... these are so fantastic and not to be found on any other device.I'm giving this phone 4 stars instead of 5 because it's become a battery suck (unlike previous versions so I imagine it has something to do with the ridiculous touch screen) and it's physically bigger than previous models.

I've had a Galaxy S4, Galaxy S3, Iphone 5 and Iphone 4S this year. While the 9930 does not have the specs of those phones, the Blackberry OS7  integrates so well with the phone hardware that you won't notice any lags in performance. You're not going to be able to play Infinity Gauntlet or any of the higher-powered games, but chances are you don't really care about that if you're looking at a Blackberry 9930.

B005HYU1YE,AMLDT3RMN9BS8,"Quentin Gerlach ""IT Guy""","[51, 55]","I feel for you Verizon customers who have been waiting to upgrade your Blackberries - especially if you wanted a touchscreen BB.  Since RIM never released the Torch 9800 for CDMA users, you guys never got to experience that goodness.  Surprising since the Torch is (was now, with the release of the Torch 2 and the new 9850 for Verizon) one of the few decent releases from RIM in the past couple of years.  Anywho - with the 9930 Bold, those who were left out finally have a reason to upgrade their phones.For those of you who are wondering - this is NOT the Monaco phone that RIM plans on releasing soon.  That phone is fully touchscreen - designed to replace the much hated Storm and not too much better Storm 2.Ok, so some list of changes that RIM brought about:- With the release of this Bold, RIM decided to nicely go back to the old style Bold 9000 keyboard.  The keys are a bit bigger, so for those of you whose fingers might have been too big for the Bold 2 that was released for Verizon, I urge you to give this phone's keyboard a try - you'll be pleased.  Some of you may notice the dimensions of the 9930 and the 9700 are very close, so you might wonder how they got the keyboard bigger.  Well, they did it by getting rid of the plastic lining around the sides of the phone.  Yes - both the keyboard and screen are now flush with the edge of the phone.  I'm not sure I'm a fan of this, as it makes it a whole lot easier to crack/break something important, but it seems to be a direction most phone manufacturers are moving in, so we'll see....- This phone is the first to have the new 7 OS - which is nice, but I think I'd rather have the QNX OS, thank you very much...  Haha - but it is a good OS - for those who are interested, it takes up less space than 6.  If my calculations are correct - about 15% less.  This OS also supports NFC (near-field communication), so it'll be interesting to see what kind of apps developers create to take advantage of it. (For those who remember it - NFC is how Google Wallet works) Voice search also works particularly well with this OS, and two new business apps are included, called BlackBerry Protect and Balance. Protect allows your business to remotely monitor, configure and wipe, if necessary, a remote smartphone so when the phone disappears, your whole business life doesn't disappear along with it. And Balance separates business tasks from personal stuff on a BlackBerry, which helps avoid the possibility of confidential data accidentally being sent to all those shady contacts.....- Yes, the screen is touch capable.  It's actually pretty slick - especially considering how small the screen is, comparatively speaking, so it is usable in day to day operations.  It especially works well with the browser - for all those times you need to move the page around, or zoom in on something, or zoom out to get a better view of the entire page.  Are you going to play games with it??  Most likely not.  But it is a start.- ""Liquid Graphics Technology"": there's been alot of talk about this, and what exactly does RIM mean by it.  Here's what I can tell you, from my research and usage of the phone:  RIM basically put a separate graphics processor into the phone, which means that any of the graphics stuff should be a whole lot smoother and cleaner, since there's a distinct chip handling all of it.  From what I've seen, it is pretty fluid, but it still does get hung up at times - especially when it comes to certain web pages.  But overall, definitely an improvement.  I heard it's also designed to support 3D animations and games...Alright - enough of that.  Time for the good stuff - is it worth it??Short answer - absolutely.Pros:1) Battery life rocks.  I feel for all of you iPhone and Android users whose phones die in like a day.  This phone still keeps kicking after 2 days - without plugging it in once.  Add to that the ability to actually change your battery, and that I tend to carry a spare just in case, and I can go practically a week without having to charge my phone.  Incredible....2) Faster processor.  Thank you RIM, for finally adopting a processor that breaks the 1 GHz marker in a phone!  Actually RIM upgraded a bunch of hardware - like the memory, along with the ability to do NFC communications.  Thank you for reaching the 21st century RIM - we're happy to have you!3) Global phone - this phone supports both the GSM and CDMA networks, so it can be used internationally - a big plus for our corporate employees.  If you happen to travel internationally alot - don't worry, this phone's got you covered.4) Hotspot capable - this phone I believe is the first BB to natively support hotspots.  Yes, there are apps you can download for the other phones, but you usually have to pay a decent amount (the cheapest I can remember is around 35 - 40 bucks)  This supports personal hotspot right out the box, and it does support N-type speeds.Cons:1) Apps.  Actually - it's not what you think.  It's not about the amount of apps - it's that quite a few don't work with OS 7 right now.  Though this will be corrected as the OS matures and becomes more available.2) Screen resolution - which still comes in at 640x480 pixels and 287 dpi.  It's not bad - but I was hoping to get a qHD screen on a BB soon....3) No 4G - this does annoy me greatly.  4G, especially on Verizon, is starting to get decent, and to not have that ability on this phone??  I get the fact that it's a battery hog, but with BB battery life's so good as it is, I can't imagine it detracting from it that much.Honestly - what's been holding RIM back is their lack of upgrading the hardware.  They always seem to be a year behind the phones of the present.  They finally do some catching up with the 9930.I'll update this review as I use the phone more - feel free to ask questions or correct me, since I'm sure I forgot something!!",4.0,1314748800,"08 31, 2011","Blackberry Bold Touch 9930 Verizon CDMA GSM Unlocked Phone with Touch Screen, 5MP Camera and Blackberry OS 7 - Unlocked Phone - No Warranty - Black",126.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VwDoPYemL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2935},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0

B005HYU1YE,A236DPJ22YMKHP,Skitch,"[2, 2]","My first Blackberry was a 9650 back in 2010 on Verizon. While even at the time it wasn't the 'in' thing it was definitely a solid phone that did what it was made for really well. This one is no exception and it does it all even better.Caution. Phone carrier rant ahead: Anyone with half a brain knows that the large phone companies are completely screwing us over with the price of using a phone. You know how much it costs them for you to send a text? ZERO. You know how much it costs  them for you to send 5000 texts? ZERO. I promise you it doesn't require $30 a month for them to keep your 2GB or less of data running either. I bought this phone partially because I wanted to switch to Straight Talk but I still had a couple months left on my Verizon contract that they rape you for if you cancel early. With this unlocked phone I was able to stay on Verizon's CDMA network until my contract was up then easily switch it over to Straight Talk (which is basically the AT&T; GSM network) by putting in the SIM card and just switching the system on the phone to GSM. For anyone interested, Straight Talk is a pay as you go plan that's $45 a month and it's unlimited everything. No contracts, etc. It worked without a hitch. End Rant.The phone itself I think is very underrated and under priced for such a high quality product. It's basically the same build quality as the iphone 4s or iphone 5. It's plenty fast and does what you like without any lag. For anyone having issues setting up email or accessing the web on the data connection, you have to activate the phone and wait for your carrier to basically tell the phone that it's okay for it to connect with them. This can take up to 24 hours after activating your phone. If it doesn't, call your carrier and they should be able to get you up and running. My only problem with the hardware of this phone is the battery. Compared to other basic phones and other blackberries it doesn't last as long due to the faster processor.

B005IDWIMM,ADLVFFE4VBT8,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[13, 13]","Blackberries may no longer be the top 'smart phones' because they don't do everything well but for what I consider their 'core' features - email and phone, in that order - they are still up there at the top. And the Torch and the Bold are the current top Blackberries. As a 'business phone', the Torch combines the best features of previous generation Blackberries with one of the best  highly graphical, 'touch' interface for its screen size. If anyone is looking for a 'phone and entertainment' device, there should be better alternatives but when it comes to email/phone productivity, the BBs are still tops.I do not plan to discuss the Torch long list of features and capabilities. They are all listed at RIM's and 100 other different sites. I will only talk about why I currently prefer the Torch vs. almost anything else (still not decided between a Torch and a Bold) as a 'business' phone even now when my employer would allow me to use other brands if I wanted to.THE TORCH ADVANTAGE- Physical keyboard - The most visible Torch feature is the sliding keyboard. This allows for a larger display when compared to, let's say, the Bold, without resulting into a larger phone. The illuminated keyboard seems to be the exact same size of a Bold's, only it becomes available when needed. This is not the only phone with a sliding keyboard but this is probably the best engineered. Sliding the keyboard in and out is quick, near-effortless and it quickly becomes second nature.- Touch screen - Not the first Blackberry with the feature but this seems to be the best on a BB so far. Yes, it's not as good as iPhone's but, for what I'm using it, it's just right. There is an on-screen keyboard which adapts itself to portrait/landscape but that's the least advantage the touch screen offers. The new Blackberry OS allows me to 'touch' just about anything on the screen and trigger... something. Gestures are also supported including 'pinch-zoom' in and out. And, related...- Buttons - Maybe this should have been at the top of the list. This Blackberry does not force me to do everything by touching the screen. Almost everything can be done by either pushing/clicking a button and controlling the cursor with the little trackpad or by interacting directly with the screen (tap virtual buttons) or a combination. Most of the time it's 'a combination' for me and it's always the way I feel most comfortable about doing things. I appreciate the ability to use physical buttons when I want it.- Email integration - This is a 'soft' feature. The Torch can integrate several email accounts, including the 'enterprise' email into one 'consolidated' mailbox while still giving me the ability to view them separately if I chose to do so.- Wi-Fi - The Wi-Fi ability saves money. My employer encouraged me to pick a plan that charges by the call. Unless it's a VoIP. Therefore, while at home or in the office, the Torch makes calls the Wi-Fi way at no cost to my employer.THE LETDOWNS[Some of the comments below may or may not apply, depending on the carrier you're using.]- The App Store - Not so good, not too many selections and a lot of 'premium' apps doing things that lots of free apps or significantly less expensive apps would do in an Android or Apple environment.-  Paid GPS and other services. GPS does not need 3G or any connection to the phone company to do what GPS does. My in-car GPS takes me from here to there, updates its maps (for free) whenever I connect it to my laptop and it gives me real-time traffic updates. And I don't pay one dime in subscriptions. GPS should be free.- Many More 'premium' Services - I understand that phone companies want to make as much money as they possibly can but competition is tough and I found no incentive to take advance of paid 'radio' or similar offers.- The Battery - Without watching movies, just a little bit of Web browsing and regular phone and mail, the Torch would need daily recharges. It would go for 2-3 days with phone and email (no browsing) only. A longer battery life would have been nice.MY RATING (4.5 stars)I will round this up to 5 stars because I am really happy with my Torch. There are some real issues when it comes to 'apps' and services other than phone and mail but, from my point of view, they don't matter to me much. Yes, the battery is a concern and at time I worried about running out of juice in a place where a recharge was no possible, but all the other 'weak' features I don't miss because I don't use them. The Torch is my 'business' phone and just about everything that impacts my business is done well.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;",5.0,1318377600,"10 12, 2011","Blackberry Torch 2 9810 Unlocked Phone with 1.2GHz Processor, GPS, 5 MP Camera and HD Video - Unlocked Phone - No Warranty - Grey",129.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UfKiKLI1L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 53204},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0
B005IDWIMM,A18MBO1U4DPY20,Harkanwar Anand,"[3, 3]","I decided to use my dad's phone because he wasn't too keen on a Blackberry, his first smartphone. So well, let me take this point by point, the torch 2 is an interesting phone, the design is good and so on, let me break this down for you.Features -a) 5 Megapixel Camera, a fast processor, some inbuilt memory, OS 7.0 and camera with flashb) A very stable battery life, possibly the best I've had since the original Blackberry Curvec) A ""fair at best"" speakerphoned) Call Quality was average, a step below all Blackberries I've used, signal is kinda choppy but that could be the network.e) The slide out qwerty keyboard gives you access to the standard blackberry keyboard. This is flimsy and opens easily.f) Light weight, easy on the eyes, nice big LED, thank god for the trackpad, the touchscreen isn't all thatPROS -a) If I were to change to an Android phone tomorrow, the first thing I would miss the EXCELLENT battery life of this Blackberry. Sometimes the phone lasted me a day and half with regular usage. It takes very little time to charge. The most annoying thing about the iPhone 4S was that the battery life (despite the software updates) kept dying for me within 14 hours irrespective of usage.b) GPS works good, I was actually very surprised but the Google Maps worked very good on this phone. Initially I found the multi-tasking easy but I like to maximise battery so I close apps that are not running and i suggest you do the same especially applications such as CAMERA, GOOGLE MAPS and BLACKBERRY APP WORLD are BATTERY-HOGGERS.c) While I have used Blackberries with better keyboards, the design of the phone makes it just about adequate for people who don't text every minute of the day. I wish the keys felt better but the manufacturer had little room to manuever with this design so they did a fairly good job.d) OS 7.0  -  Although it is a bit of a hit and miss, the OS is good until it crashes (tbc)e) Sturdy - Even though I had to go invest in a new BACK PIECE, it must have been something I did.CONS -a) This is meant to be a touchscreen phone but I would seldom use that feature because it is sub-par at best. The typing on the screen is ridiculously bad using the onscreen keyboard. sometimes things wouldn't click, sometimes while browsing I would hit the wrong button. The touchscreen is HALF BAKED.b) Tinny - earphone speaker volume - not very clear ... The Blackberry bolds have far better voice clarity.c) After about 45 days of using this phone, the software just crashed on me this morning and I didn't have a recent backup so I've lost my recent notes, recent contacts and call history including BBM.Obviously, this will make me once again consider going back to the HTC EVO or upgrading to the HTC Sensation XL.d) Limited multimedia experience. Blackberry has been unable to convert the phone into a multimedia warehouse like Apple or Google. Granted the target audience doesn't care about such things but it is very annoying for someone who wants a one stop device for all features. I've used Androids and the Apple. Apple undoubtedly has the best music player.e) I'm not an App freak but the Apps on Blackberries are a joke and Blackberry ID is very annoying. RIM is not very app focused, Palm wasn't either, maybe it's time for an Android integration?f) The menu is not as easy to scroll and configure as Android or Apple.g) The browsing experience is very average, the phone is slow, googling seems high laborious.h) Horrid Camera. Possibly the worst camera I've used among recent phones. I go through a lot of phones and the camera is bad unless the lighting is very good. I'd give the camera a 5.5/10. The 9780 has a much better lens. The various settings mode are useless. Changing the RESOLUTION makes no difference. The camera is at par with the camera on the BLACKBERRY TOUR or Curve 2 (the one with the trackball)BUYER'S DECISION MAKING  -If you are an Android or iPhone user and hate it so much for the battery life, you will like this phone but read my review again so you know what you're getting into. Everyone in India seems to have the Blackberry which is why I stuck with mine for 7 weeks but I think I'm going to do some research and invest in an HTC Android.If you are a current Blackberry user and have a trackball based device - you will like this phone.If you are a current BB user who has a blackberry curve with trackpad - Look into the Androids or the iPhoneFor me, overall, the torch 2 is more good than bad. My software crashed last night and I got the ERROR 102. This has really upset me because I lost a lot of my data. I know it is my mistake that I did not back up the data but I thought the OS 7.0 would be a step above OS 5.X and OS 6.X so I never bothered.This was my first touchscreen Blackberry but the slider always keeps opening when it's in my pocket. I am somehow not comfortable with the design and feel the blues when I hold the 9780.Perhaps you should check the 9780 / 9790 if you need to keep a blackberry. The Bolds are always the most stable BLACKBERRIES I am now noticing.",3.0,1325980800,"01 8, 2012","Blackberry Torch 2 9810 Unlocked Phone with 1.2GHz Processor, GPS, 5 MP Camera and HD Video - Unlocked Phone - No Warranty - Grey",129.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UfKiKLI1L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 53204},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",-1.0
B005IDWIMM,A1IAZWSDQPJ4E7,"Menno Aartsen ""MEA""","[0, 0]","(while this review was written about the T-Mobile version of this phone, I do not believe that are differences between the two carrier versions, with the exception of UMA, a.k.a. WiFi Calling, only supported by T-Mobile)Update 5/8/2014: It is still going strong, but I've just relegated this Torch to ""backup Blackberry"", and replaced it with a (refurbished) T-Mobile Blackberry Z10.Original review:I love my new Torch, beginning with the slide-under keyboard - the keyboard in my Bold 9700 eventually wore out because I slid it in and out of its belt holster a dozen times a day, from December 2009 through April 2012, it was my primary phone all that time. It traveled around the world with me several times in that period, when I discovered that Blackberry handsets even let you roam 3G in Japan - not something any other handset commonly available from an American carrier could do, in 2010, when I first turned it on at Tokyo Narita Airport. But with that, the slide-under keyboard, and the larger touch screen, I am very happy with this Torch. It is very sturdy, too, due to its metal casing and sliding mechanism. Because the sliding keyboard will never rub up against anything, this Blackberry is the best thing since sliced bread, for Blackberry aficionados. If you've never used a Blackberry before, perhaps this is one you should try, since it has the touch screen keyboard as well, so you never need to use the slide if you don't want to, or if you just want to sit in Starbuck$ looking like you know what you're doing.Most carriers will let you exchange the handset for another if you do that within the week, should you decide you don't like it. And there really is not a huge difference between the AT&T; Wireless 9810 and the T-Mobile 9810, except for T-Mobile's ""WiFi Calling"", known to us techies as ""UMA"", which lets you make calls and use data over a WiFi connection, when you're inside a building where service is blocked, or at home, or in locales where there is no cellular service, if you subscribe to this it gives you free minutes and data. Not new, UMA has been available in the US since 2007. I use it all over the world, free WiFi is everywhere these days, from Starbucks in Beijing to your bed 'n breakfast in Patagonia.As I've said, reviewing phones, in terms of comparing them, is increasingly impossible. They simply have too much functionality, too many capabilities, for a comparison by a reviewer who has played with the thing for a week to be meaningful. In that respect, the user reviews at carrier and vendor sites are more useful. Even there, though, there is a lot of reading between the lines to be done, and as is the case with most phones and computers, weeding out the ""reviews"" from many users that don't run the basic setup and update routines prior to use is a necessity. Reading up on reviews of the Torch 9810 at the AT&T; Wireless site, it looks to me at least half the reviewers are in the ""self inflicted"" category, and remember that are ""reviewers"" that have never actually used what they describe. Weird, I know, but that's your internet.So all I am doing here is tell you about my experiences with the Torch, with perhaps some comparison with my old Blackberry Bold, and my other phone, a Nokia C7. Why do I have multiple phones? In a nutshell, I need my ""old"" East Coast mobile number to continue, but needed a local Seattle number as well. It isn't a luxury, and in fact, I tend to think that much as we have progressed to one number per person from one number per home, technology allows us to progress to one number per purpose per person - work, home, Ebay, Gramps, you name it. Dual SIM phones are available, and we can even have numbers (see Google Voice) that don't need their own handset. Something that impressed the heck out of me was the restoration of my Blackberry backup - while available for other brands of handsets, the Blackberry recovery was seamless, a Bold 9700 backup restored to a Torch 9810, without so much as a hiccup, this after the Blackberry Desktop I was using already updated the Torch OS automagically.Some other stuff I really like: Blackberry Protect, which will let me locate and wipe the handset remotely, and I just connected the Blackberry Bluetooth modem to my Sony Vaio desktop, and found, much to my surprise, that the dialup modem settings I have always had to manually set for T-Mobile aren't necessary any more, on the Torch. Why, I don't yet know, but all this with non-custom drivers is quite astonishing, although I may be in nerd territory with this, I don't really know.Highly confusing, to me, is that T-Mobile is pushing (we're talking May 2012 here) the expensive Blackberry Bold 9900, when they have the Blackberry Torch 9810 still available. Both support 4G and have a touch screen as well as the ubiquitous Blackberry keyboard, but the Torch, which is cheaper, has the slide-under keyboard and a larger touch screen than does the Bold. Other specifications, down to Blackberry's ""new"" 7.1 operating system, appear to be the same for both. I can only imagine that the 9810, sold by AT&T; Wireless under the same type designation, was manufactured specifically to support the AT&T; Wireless / TMO merger, shot dead in November of last year by the Federal Communications Commission. That means the phone would be able to work on both the AT&T; Wireless and T-Mobile GSM networks, which share frequencies for GSM and EDGE connectivity, but use different frequencies for 3G and 4G high speed data connections. I know T-Mobile introduced phones that have the capability, my Nokia C7, which TMO calls the ""Astound"", is capable of running 3G on both networks, so I'll test whether the Torch does that too - I haven't yet tested that, although T-Mobile did make a carrier unlock available to me.",4.0,1340496000,"06 24, 2012","Blackberry Torch 2 9810 Unlocked Phone with 1.2GHz Processor, GPS, 5 MP Camera and HD Video - Unlocked Phone - No Warranty - Grey",129.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UfKiKLI1L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 53204},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0
B005IDWIMM,AMLDT3RMN9BS8,"Quentin Gerlach ""IT Guy""","[43, 45]","For most people, the Torch 9800 was the first decent touchscreen phone RIM brought to the market.  None of that SurePress nonsense, and the screen was actually responsive enough to be of use when you didn't necessarily want to use the trackpad/keyboard.For all intents and purposes - the Torch 9810 looks NO different than the 9800. If you put them side-by-side, I'm not sure if anyone would be able to tell which is which.  That's alright though, since RIM focused on what's really important, and that's the hardware of the phone.Updates:- The processor in the 9810 has been upgraded, same one that's in the Bold 9930 - Qualcomm Snapdragon 1.2 GHz.  There's no multi-core functionality or anything like that, but the processor upgrade definitely helps makes the Torch 2 a snappier phone.- ""Liquid Graphics Technology"" - the Torch 9810 is touted as having this feature too, along with most of the OS 7 phones.  Basically RIM put in a separate graphics processor to handle all the visual stuff, which again, does help make the phone seem more fluid and responsive - but don't think that means you won't see the all-too familiar hourglass.  You will at times, just not as often.- Screen resolution has been bumped up.  It used to be 480 x 360, but they've increased it to 640 x 480.  I was hoping RIM would jump on the qHD wagon and get some phones with that kind of screen resolution, but it looks like we'll have to wait a bit longer.- Updated camera software: the camera is still 5 MP, but the zoom was extended from 2X to 4X, and face detection was added to the Torch 2.  There is no front-facing camera, so doesn't look like Video Chat will be working anytime soon on a BB phone....- OS 7: nice OS, browser is once again improved.  The amount of space it takes up in memory seems to have shrunk as well - about 15% less than OS 6.  Two new business apps are included, called BlackBerry Protect and Balance. Protect allows your business to remotely monitor, configure and wipe, if necessary, a remote smartphone so when the phone disappears, your whole business life doesn't disappear along with it. And Balance separates business from personal stuff on a BlackBerry, which helps avoid the possibility of confidential data accidentally being sent to all those shady contacts.....Alright - so is it worth it??This one is honestly a judgement call - so I'll say it like this:  if you have the original Torch, you might not like it, since it feels like this is what the Torch 9800 should've been all along.  If you have an older Blackberry - you will like this.Pros:1) The upgraded hardware really helps make the phone a pleasure to use.  With the faster processor and the increased RAM size, the phone's no powerhouse - but it becomes somewhat competitive with what's out on the market today.2) Battery life gets a nice improvement:  I believe this was an OS issue as much as a hardware issue on the Torch 9800, but it seems that RIM corrected the OS part with the new OS 7 - battery usually lasts me a day, even with Pandora going.  Nice job RIM. (Good note to make: the old Torch's battery is compatible with the new Torch)3) Phone calls - hey, let's face it, the Torch is a PHONE.  It can do a whole lot of other stuff - but at the end of the day, it's a PHONE, and I should be able to make PHONE CALLS.  Never had a dropped call yet - especially in NYC.  Something I hated about the iPhone was that - especially in the city - I would lose a bunch of calls.  Never happened with this Torch.  Not yet anyway....4) 4G - RIM's first 4G phone right here.  I only experienced the speed once - near NYC.  I got around 4 MB/s down - it was beautiful.  4G service is very spotty though - at the moment, especially with AT&T.;  Should get better as time goes on.Cons:1) Battery cover: GOD, I really hate the back that RIM put on this Torch.  I don't know what they were thinking, but I trashed it as soon as I saw it.  I'll use the old Torch's cover, thank you very much....2) Same old, same old: RIM tends to get stuck in a rut when it comes to taking some chances with designs.  I was hoping the Torch 2 might have some design improvements - or at least some visual improvements, but instead, it's just more of the same.  I hope RIM gets willing to take some risk in this field soon....3) Top buttons way too sensitive: this was a problem on the first Torch too.  It was way too easy to lock your phone.  RIM, in keeping with the same design elements, also migrated this problem to the Torch 2.Bottom line: the Torch 2 is a good phone, really what the Torch 1 should've been.  If you're okay with it looking like the original Torch, then by all means - jump on this.  For the rest of you - you may want to try another Blackberry, such as the new Bold 9930 - or the Monaco, which should be coming out sometime this month.I'll update this as I use the phone more, but feel free to leave a comment or question below.  I'm here to educate, so if I got something wrong, let me know....",4.0,1314921600,"09 2, 2011","Blackberry Torch 2 9810 Unlocked Phone with 1.2GHz Processor, GPS, 5 MP Camera and HD Video - Unlocked Phone - No Warranty - Grey",129.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UfKiKLI1L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 53204},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0

B005LSS3L4,A18MBO1U4DPY20,Harkanwar Anand,"[37, 40]","Pros -1. Good screen size, good graphics while browsing, the phone has a very sleek built and looks attractive to hold, there is a lock mechanism on top of the phone.2. Despite being a touchscreen phone the blackberry has a scroll trackpad for those who may miss it or may need it, this is required to ensure pinpoint accuracy for those who haven't mastered the touchscreen immediately.3. Great camera, super fast. Picture a friend looking to get out of the image before you click, too late, the camera is super fast. It does have a flash too.4. Call quality is strong and you get reception everywhere. OS 7.0 isn't very different from the previous Operating System. Some say it should have been called 6.5 to show the lack of technological advancement since the previous operating system.Cons -1. While the phone is sleek, the on screen keyboard will take some time getting used to and there aren't many options for changing it.2. Compared to an Android the screen doesn't have that kind of wooing ability.3. The phone is a blackberry without a keyboard and for those who stick to the blackberry for features such as BBM, this is an immediate departure.4. While this is a great phone, it is missing a keyboard and therefore pitted directly against Android phones and that is where it is truly beaten black and blue. As an entertainment device it isn't very loud.For a very long time, Blackberry was formulaic and introduced little changes to their phones because their known formula was working. I used to respect them for that but in this day and age when you are competing with the likes of Apple and Android, most people who use the Blackberry as their sole device are dropping it and looking for other things. There are many cross platform chat softwares which work three quarters as good as the Blackberry like say Whatsapp (instead of the famous BBM).If you are considering getting this phone, do look at a store model I would strongly suggest. Voice clarity is good, design is good, the basics are fine. People coming from old Samsung Instincts would like this phone. So would people who have a Blackberry Style. Someone coming to this phone from an Android like Samsung Epic or HTC Evo won't be able to use it without complaining once in a way. The battery life is poor because they are now making their phone slimmer and the touchscreens bigger. From Blackberry I would like a better browsing experience and maybe a better onscreen keyboard.

B005QCUWBO,ADLVFFE4VBT8,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[0, 0]","The new design for a Blackberry charger is small and it looks pretty but it has one notable design/functional flaw which should be considered when shopping for an additional Blackberry (or generic) USB charger.Briefly, the slot where the USB cable plugs in is on the side rather than on top - like the official Kindle USB charger - or in front. Therefore, if you want to plug it into a power strip it's mandatory that it's plugged on the last outlet, either on the left or on the right of the strip because there would be no room for the USB cable otherwise. Another issue - don't know if it's a problem - is that the plug is not grounded (2-pronged plug) but the makers of Blackberry apparently have concluded that this should be okay and my Blackberries survived so far.Anyone who can live with the above should find the adapter as good as any other USB charger. Here are its good features, besides 'pretty':- Small - up until recently, chargers used to be extra-wide and sometimes prevented the use of outlets to their left or right on a power strip. This one is the right size, for as long as it's the last one on the left or on the right.- Generic (universal) - it can be used to charge just about any Blackberry and many other gadgets that charge through a MicroUSB port (or a Mini USB if you supply the cable) - Besides the Blackberry Torch, I am using it with a Kindle and a couple of Bluetooth headsets and MP3 players. Note that the reverse is also true. I am routinely charging my Blackberries (currently have a Bold and a Torch) off the Kindle charger and everything else can be charged with the Bold's 'old school' big charger.- Modular - like Kindle's charger, this one will work with any Type A male to Micro-B or Mini USB male cable so, if the original cable stops working or is lost, any USB cable replacement will do.- Inexpensive - for a 'branded' charger. There are lots of one-dollar generic USB chargers around but you always take a gamble with those and Kindle's own is a little more expensive.To conclude, if one concern is 'power strip clutter' and price doesn't matter, the best USB charger is Kindle's. If price and quality are the main concerns, this may very well be 'the one' to get. Or, if you have some older charger lying around and you don't mind 'older' you may not need this at all.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;",4.0,1307836800,"06 12, 2011",Blackberry USB AC Charger Adapter Power Plug with Micro USB Cable for Blackberry,4.25,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41TpqJSZ9VL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3984},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Travel Chargers']]",1.0

B00B90KCNU,A1NX2X9SKM65BF,Mike Fernandez,"[27, 31]","I know that in today's world almost everyone believes that Blackberries are doomed to extinction. Two years ago when my old Blackberry Bold died for no reason, I was one of them. I thought they &#34;lost their magic&#34; and my girlfriend got me an iPod, an iPad, and I got myself two android phones. My first one was a Motorola XT316, that was a steaming pile of crap. My second one was a Samsung Galaxy Y, and it was okay.I was happy with them. The Apple devices were soo cool. And the Samsung phone worked okay. But I sorely missed on the one thing Blackberries excelled at: e-mail. E-mail, contacts, appointments and so on are a critical part of my job. Blackberry focused on that so much that before long they were no longer with the cool crowd. But communication is what the phones are for, right? Or so I thought. I was happy with all the apps. But no app came even close for e-mail as it was on the blackberry.Anyway, I was really torn between this and an iPhone. They are in about the same price range. It took me two months to finally bite the bullet and spend $650 on this thing. And it has been amazing from day one. My dear e-mail is organized as it should, my contacts, my appointments, everything. I'm in love with the HUB. It has all the cool features the apple/android devices have. Not exactly a carbon copy, but somehow very similar. The gestures work really, really well. And the thing that knocked my socks off is the word autocompletion. I can write a fully worded, well spelled, grammatically perfect e-mail in about 20 seconds. And it's no longer just e-mail... facebook, whatsapp, twitter, everything is in one place, fully integrated, and well organized.Blackberry always had something nobody else has. I agree that the old BB devices where ugly, that their naming convention was confusing (and silly), their camera sucked and they tended to die for no reason. If Android or iOS had some of the e-mail features & security blackberries have, right now I would've been reviewing their phones.In short, this is Blackberry &#34;hail mary pass&#34; and it is a resounding touchdown all around. Truth to be told, there are not all that many &#34;crush the sweets&#34; apps for it, but I believe that that's what my Playstation is for. I may be in a different wavelenght that the rest of the market, I'm not an expert or anything.

B00B90KCNU,A15CVOWCUQV39L,RDS,"[4, 29]","Update 08/13/2013  Blackberry the company, is FOR SALE as very few like to buy their new Smartphone's like Z10, Q10 !!! as stated Monday Aug 13, they are looking for an easy way out and is selling....I am thinking there may not be a buyer for they should have done this quietly cause this will make their customers nervous about blackberry's future...Analyst saying Blackberry may go private but this is a very very bad sign, meaning Blackberry may want to die quietly without any press coverage while it is disposing all its valuable asset..Yuckkkkkk.... For those who did not listened to me you might as well trade your blackberry Z10 Q10 Q5 with iphone, Samsung or nokia Smartphone's while it still has some value left on it. You don't want to have a piece of junk  months from now cause THERE WILL BE LESS AND LESS APP'S AVAILABLE FOR THIS SMARTPHONE and expect more BUG'S because app's developers might become lazy in updating their existing app's running on BB10 knowing that this company may go under in the future. Besides blackberry employee are for sure very demoralize as they see their future dwindling and many maybe looking for other jobs. I was thinking talented employee's of blackberry many of them maybe leaving or looking for other job. So my friends and co-consumer BE WISE and save your hard earned monies. My belief is there will only be 3 major Smartphone OS in the future and they are Apple OS, ANDROID AND WINDOWS. So if you like your investment in technology and knowledge relevant in the future just concentrate on these 3 Smartphone OS and I am pretty sure your investment will not put to waste.Tried this many times but the problem is there are very few good Apps for this blackberry new operating system, Most Apps are google apps emulated softwares design primarily for android so future updates and performance is an issue. Developers has anemic support for this new Blackberry operating system so I don't see future development of popular apps for this smartphone, I don't see any reason to spend so much money for a smartphone like BB10 if only you will use it for text messaging, voice and few apps. Some functionality are also buggy (With bugs), battery is not good enough to last if you browse a lot. Maybe be if they lower the price below $100 as compare to other smartphone with the same feature as this I may consider, I think paying more than $600 dollars for this phone is a waste of monies . Buyer beware cause this operating system may not last just like other new smartphone operating system without application developers support. Companies are starting pilot testing to convert from Blackberry to Iphone and Android smartphone so I think it is better to invest in the future and learn new technologies than stick with this new operating system that don't have support of major developers and popular tech companies like Microsoft, Netflix, facebook, google etc. Take note that if you buy this smartphone facebook, Netflix and other popular apps is not supporting and developing apps for this smartphone so you may regret spending a whooping $600 plus for smartphone like this.Buyer specially current user of blackberry should also realize that this new blackberry is totally different from the old blackberry phone they have before, this one has new operating system, functionality and features, so effort in learning how to use this is similar to learning how to use the much popular smartphone like iphone, android and even windows phone. Iphone, android and even windows are tested and with strong big hi-tech company support and application developers support, so why not spend your effort in learning popular and tested smartphone instead of spending so much money for this new blackberry smartphone that I for sure will be gone in the future. Without developers and big hi tech company support this new blackberry operating system will be gone in next couple of years.I hate it when consumers are being reap off, if you buy this phone for close to $700 including taxes what you get is a phone good for texting, browsing the internet and emails, very few popular apps are available for this phone yes they have 100,000 apps but most of the popular one are android apps, if the underlying android apps where updated user of this phone will have problem using them unless they manually upgrades. If you buy apple, android and windows phone after two years you can sell them and get some money back or you can even trade them to get new phone, this blackberry phone, theres nothing you can do with this phone after two years it maybe gone and there is not enough senior citizen to buy this phone in the future.

B00BC0WNUC,A2RFU2WEK9DXMR,Daniel J. Kinem,"[178, 213]","I've owned and used Droid Incredible, Note 1, S3, iPhone 4s, multiple Windows phones. But, I don't have to use every phone ever made to know that Z10 is the best phone available.I'm so thoroughly enamored with BB10 after only one week of using it. I have an S3 through Verizon, but I bought a Z10 from Canada because I couldn't wait any longer. When I have to use my S3, I find it clumsy and slow and I'm not talking processor speed. I'm talking about the user interface (UI) I am constantly phantom swiping, then I realize I have to look for buttons/keys, etc. Why should I have to look around click the 'back' arrow a dozen times to get out of an app? Swipe up, it's minimized. Tap the 'X' if I've the urge, to close the app. I have 4, 6, 8 open at times with NO performance penalty.And how could I have possibly tolerated such an archaic method of communication as Android? I used to excitedly show my iPhone friends the notification center, and the tweeks of the notification center. Hahaha! Who, after using a BB10 device for a week or two, will ever accept anything less than the Hub? Here's my life to this point...closing the app I am in, opening the app that has the communication interaction (text, FB, LinkedIn, etc), responding in that app, closing that app, then finding and reopening the original app I was in? Serious? How much better is the Hub than anything else available? Infinitely better. Swipe up and over, respond without opening any other apps or closing the app you were in, return. Never again will I settle for anything less efficient.The virtual keyboard? Wow...I never thought I would love something as much as my brief encounter with the Bold 9930 physical keyboard, but this is nothing short of amazing. Stunning in look, feel, accuracy. It's beautiful and efficient and I love it. It even sounds amazing. I'm so fast and accurate and it has to be because of BB, because my fat thumbs aren't any more nimble when I use the S3.The browser? It SMOKES my S3's browser. I don't even understand how it can be as fast as it is? Why are Android and iPhone browsers so slow? And they have the address bar inconveniently located at the top?  Compare it to any browser on any platform. The videos are out there to PROVE it, but actually using it yourself is spectacular.Yes, every week another droid comes out with great specs and more cores, but it's the same thing over and over. It's the same clumsy, slow, inefficient UI. NO security. SPECS DON'T MAKE IT A BETTER PHONE! All it does is makes an impressive stat sheet. Do stat sheets make your day better? Does it make your life easier to have more cores? Is that what you begged for in your next phone?Yes, BB doesn't have all the apps yet. They will build them.  But, it's OS is something none of the others will have...ever.Google and Apple know they are behind now. Their browser and keyboard are woeful in comparison.  And they have NOTHING EVEN CLOSE TO 'Hub' and 'Balance.' Who would like to argue that? The the gesture based UI? I guess, that is a personal preference, and you could argue it, but try it for a couple weeks and then pick up the others. Wow, could they be any less elegant?Android and iOS will have to steal the 'Hub' and 'Balance'. They will have to patch sloppy hack code onto an OS that was built to play apps. For BB10 the OS was built with those things at it's heart. Security, communication, separation of work/play were afterthoughts for them. If Android and iOS have to copy many key components of BB10 OS....who is behind who? What is a better phone? A list of specs meant to 'wow' the geeks, or one that makes your day better and more efficient...a few seconds at a time, hundreds of times per day....",5.0,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",BlackBerry Z10 16Gb Black WiFi Touchscreen Unlocked GSM QuadBand Cell Phone,203.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nDWGd81VL._SY300_.jpg,,BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0

Without developers and big hi tech company support this new blackberry operating system will be gone in next couple of years.I am updating this review for I already decided which smartphone I will buy please read:No blackberry home button. Many are complaining that Z10 Freezes a lot, especially when using AppsAs I am evaluating Smartphone cause I am planning to upgrade from my old iphone 3gs (almost 4 years old) I am evaluating Smartphone based in blackberry, iphone, android and windows 8. That is why due to hype about this device, I initially considering buying BB10 Z10 tried many times to test it and see its worth. My budget is between 500 to 800 dollars. As I am reading reviews, trying the product myself and even went to blackberry website about Z10 complaints well there is a lot of them mostly operating system, hardware and software related. One thing that's get my attention is the blackberry Z10 having no home screen button, this is important because since many of blackberry apps are not develop and optimize for its operating system but is originally for android if the apps freezes (Due to bugs or outdated software) there Is no way for a user to go back to the home screen but to reset the Z10. Since this is most likely to happen a lot of times as the apps really not optimize for new blackberry operating system resetting devises and waiting for it to boot is very stressing. The maps for Z10 is useless my wife has the old BB7 and she hated it, her company provides it so she has no choice, but this year her company is pilot testing iphone so maybe this year or next year they will convert. I think blackberry should lower the prize of Z10 to less than $100 for the consumer to get fair price since you can most likely use Z10 or Q10 for texting, instant messaging, voice and internet browsing. Close to $700 for Z10 is very expensive considering that you can buy old iphone and android phone with the same capability plus good ecosystem, good popular apps are available and gadgets integration for less than $100. Do you know that you can get iphone 4 and 4s for free if you sign a two year contract with the carrier? This is much better than paying $200 for Z10 with poor selection of apps, close to isolated ecosystem, face with a lot of bugs since it has the new operating system and softwares, dismal apps developers support etc. One more thing, this blackberry phone same as the old one is difficult to dispose cause you can't sell them or give it to your kids they will not accept it and you will end up throwing wasting monies, this may holds true with this Z10, no apps developers support, no big hi tech company backing/supporting it most likely this new operating system will be gone just like the others. My research is over and will buy the new iphone or Samsung galaxy S4. My son is more than willing to get my old iphone 3gs but I am thinking about just using my old iphone as navigational device with Magellan apps for iphone (take note many good apps for navigation is not available for blackberry). I am sharing my review and research so that others will not waste money buying expensive smartphone. For now I believe considering the future direction of modern technologies like good ecosystem, integration, device manufacturers support it is better to buy smartphone based in apple IOS, google android and Microsoft windows 8. Don't waste your hard earn monies buying other smartphone cause they may be gone in the future, if the price is less than $100 go ahead cause that is just like buying a regular good cellphone for texting and voice.",1.0,1365379200,"04 8, 2013",BlackBerry Z10 16Gb Black WiFi Touchscreen Unlocked GSM QuadBand Cell Phone,203.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nDWGd81VL._SY300_.jpg,,BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0

B00C1DIGRI,A4PNSCLT6G6P1,A. Schmitt,"[9, 19]","I received my Q10 on 6/21 and after getting through all the activation issues, I'm still having some very basic, elementary lagging issues with my texting/BB Hub. We all know that texting is important and that it should be something that is very quick, especially nowadays, should be immediate. The issue I have is NOT NOT NOT with my network connection as it does this throughout the state and is solely within the OS. When I send a text, it takes about 30 seconds to actually show up in the conversation. I'm not referring to the time it takes to actually send, which would be fine, but physically show up in the conversation. On top of that, I can't send a text and then continue to my next text in that conversation until after the last text shows up. And all on top of that, I can't quickly move back and forth between conversations as it will keep going back to the last message I sent until the last message appears. I have spoken with AT&T; Tech Support and they couldn't do anything, now I'm going to have to do a full system restore and see if that kicks out any bugs in the OS. If that doesn't work, I'm taking it back to AT&T; and trying another Q10. If that still has the problems, I'm going to get a Samsung Galaxy S4.Please be aware that this is not just a personal issue, but blogs such as Blackberry and Crackberry, people all over are having this same issue and no OS update or resolution have been able to fix this problem. I will update if necessary, but if I don't, I've finally gone with a full touchscreen as I love the physical QWERTY keyboard. Its a disappointing problem as Blackberry was so confident with its marketing of the new 10s and multitasking through the new Hub software. Fingers are crossed for now that my issue somehow becomes resolved. Please heed this warning however because it may happen to you.***Update 6/25: I took the Q10 into AT&T; and they were as dumbfounded as I was. While there, I changed my mind about swapping for a new device and went with the Samsung Galaxy S4. I was hesitant to not only get a new device as I was worried it would occur in the future, but also with getting a full touchscreen keyboard as I have been Blackberry loyal for 10 years. I loved being able to feel the keys as I typed and not having to look down at the screen, much like typing on a computer keyboard, so it was an end of an era for me. Fortunately, the S4 was so much better in so many ways (ie, the keyboard is easy to get comfortable with and prediction is spot on but doesn't screw up your messages, and the S4 is so much more user-friendly and customizable than the bare bones Q10 - it seems like you can't customize anything with the Q10 like you used to be able to with the older BBs, and there are so many more useful apps available with the S4 - Gmail and Google Maps for two examples). So, with that said, in my review, I would definitely recommend doing away with a Blackberry and going with a more modern phone and be happier in the end after making the switch. This whole process was a huge let down and disappointment for me as I have been a big supporter of BB over the years, but this time they just fell flat on their face and let a lot of us loyal customers down. Still no patch or fix for the lagging of texts on the forums, so be aware.",1.0,1372032000,"06 24, 2013","Blackberry Q10 Black 16GB Factory Unlocked, International Version - 4G / LTE 3, 7, 8, 20 (1800 / 2600 / 900 / 800 MHz)",252.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JF0j-5k1L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 673},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0
B00C1DIGRI,A19AGK07RP4KT4,Cellphonenut,"[10, 11]","The main reason I'm reviewing this q10 is the hope that Blackberry is taking notice of end costumer concerns.I picked up a q10 yesterday at AT&T;, my current carrier. It is awesome ! I've owned every top tier touch screen phone available.Nokia 920, LG Optimus G pro, GS4, BB z10, HTC One, Moto Droid Razr HD maxx, and of coarse all versions of the iPhone.The Windows OS, BB10 OS, iOS are the smoothest and most intuitive I've used as far touch screens go.But nothing compares to q10 running  BB10. I can't remember a phone that just flows so perfectly when you just need to get things done. The keyboard is just a delight to use.Also I may add that the call, reception, and sound quality on this q10 is 2nd to none. I can't count the number of dropped calls with Androids and iPhones.No restarts or battery pulls like BB's of old either  I'm now on my third week of use and still have not restated this q10 with the exception of one OTA update !I can't imagine using anything else now that I have the q10, with the exception of q10 with a LARGER DISPLAY !! Yes Blackberry. are you listening? Not a 5"" inch phablet, but com'n mein I know a manageable 4"" inch display could be designed into the q10 !!A larger display could have been crammed into this unit when you consider how large the bezel around it is . Blackberry you have a winner BUT PLEASE BUILD A LARGER DISPLAY VERSION OF THE Q10 BECAUSE THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS ONE SIZE FITS ALL.Wouldn't mind having da LCD screen ILU the Amoled also. The battery life as it stands gets 2 days. i'd be willing to sacrifice battery life for the super bright screen like on the z10. z10 is the only current phone that completely readable display in direct sunlight.Oh, and while your at it might as well start giving app developers some tools and incentives to create more and better apps.And fix the voice command, it sucks !!Although for me this is not as big an issue as display size.Thats it, the new q10 is just awesome yet the tiny display can be a bit frustrating at times.

B00C1DIGRI,A15CVOWCUQV39L,RDS,"[16, 206]","Update 08/13/2013  Blackberry the company, is FOR SALE as very few like to buy their new Smartphone's like Z10, Q10 !!! as stated Monday Aug 13, they are looking for an easy way out and is selling....I am thinking there may not be a buyer for they should have done this quietly cause this will make their customers nervous about blackberry's future...Analyst saying Blackberry may go private but this is a very very bad sign, meaning Blackberry may want to die quietly without any press coverage while it is disposing all its valuable asset..Yuckkkkkk.... For those who did not listened to me you might as well trade your blackberry Z10 Q10 Q5 with iphone, Samsung or nokia Smartphone's while it still has some value left on it. You don't want to have a piece of junk  months from now cause THERE WILL BE LESS AND LESS APP'S AVAILABLE FOR THIS SMARTPHONE and expect more BUG'S because app's developers might become lazy in updating their existing app's running on BB10 knowing that this company may go under in the future. Besides blackberry employee are for sure very demoralize as they see their future dwindling and many maybe looking for other jobs. I was thinking talented employee's of blackberry many of them maybe leaving or looking for other job. So my friends and co-consumer BE WISE and save your hard earned monies. My belief is there will only be 3 major Smartphone OS in the future and they are Apple OS, ANDROID AND WINDOWS. So if you like your investment in technology and knowledge relevant in the future just concentrate on these 3 Smartphone OS and I am pretty sure your investment will not put to waste.6/27/2013 update: My fellow consumer think twice before spending too much on this phone, recently I did my Costco shopping and was surprise to see that they markdown the upfront cost for a two year contract for the Z10 (same as Q10 except for the keyboard). Since last week  you can now get the Z10 for $50 with contract used to be you have to pay $200 2 months ago, I say this product is not really selling well in our great country USA a huge markdown of 150 dollars in just a period of less than 3 months. In comparison to apple ios 5 and Samsung galaxy the price of their phone is not going down and still expensive even after 1 year I say a great investment. As you can see the price of this Q10 phone started here beyond expensive at close to $1200, now going down to close to $600. To be realistic blackberry says before the launch of Q10 that they will offer this at the range of between 650 to 750 but still a markdown of close to $600 is not a good sign. Just recently since the Q10 is not really selling well Blackberry immediately release a lower price version of it they now called Q5 price starting they say at $400. I still think Q5 is expensive.The bottom line,  I still think that blackberry devices under its new OS BB10 will be gone in the future just like palm (there will only be 3 major smartphone OS THAT WILL DOMINATE THE MARKET Apple IOS, GOOGLE ANDROID and Microsoft windows 8), but if you really like blackberry wait a little bit longer and you may get these new devices for FREE with a two year contract. But I reminded you that your Blackberry financial investment and technical knowledge will be wasted as I see no hope for this company in the future as a device manufacturer.My original posting:This is what i call a punishment for those who stick with vintage smartphone keyboard tech. basically you can buy a phone like this with keyboard for less than a hundred dollars. Blackberry is desperate for profit so they are milking monies out of their loyal hard core blackberry users. i am rating this 1 star same as i rated the z10 because the only diff between the two is the vintage keyboard. Pricewise this product is 1 star. if you are a business owner buying this phone for your business is not a wise decision because there are much cheaper phone same functionalities as this one for less than a hundred dollars.Honestly if you are a business owner you don't want your employee representing your company to carry a phone line this, because this is a turn-Off especially for young clients like 50 years old below. Maybe if you are ready to retire, don't care about what others may think of you as being too vintage THIS PHONE IS GOOD FOR YOU, but still the price I think is too much. Sometimes I see guys carrying a phone like this with keyboard, and in the modern Smartphone world of app's and advance technologies, I can't help measuring a person's adept to modern technologies with the model of Smartphone he carries. I believe it is good for one person's advancement and good company reputation if they carry Smartphone impressive enough and in line with trend and future technological direction. Since this phone is good for texting, voice call, phone like this should only be sold for less than a 100 dollars. The screen not big enough, I don't see this phone good for app's, video and web browsing. Why pay too much for less functionality that you can use.If your really a hardcore blackberry user WAIT FOR THIS Q10 PHONE's price to go down to less than $200 just like other smartphone of this caliber, Take note you can save more monies if you wait a little bit longer cause you might get this for free with a two year contract, great possibility that this phones new OS will cease to exist or obsolete in a couple of years just like other smartphones new software and operating system.",1.0,1367884800,"05 7, 2013","Blackberry Q10 Black 16GB Factory Unlocked, International Version - 4G / LTE 3, 7, 8, 20 (1800 / 2600 / 900 / 800 MHz)",252.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JF0j-5k1L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 673},BlackBerry,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]",1.0
