B0002SYC5O,A1HTXSEDVJBXEM,Amazon Customer,"[25, 30]","I have had an LG-700 for a few years, and I love it.  But I get complaints from people about the microphone picking up extraneous noises when I am on the phone in a supermarket, or working in the kitchen, so when it started to wear out, I tried this one.  Well....this does have pretty good sound, BUT, the rigid frame for the ""yoke"" is a problem for this guy with a 17.5"" neck.  And the location of the on/off switch is annoying (on the back).  Plus, whereas the LG-700 has 6 buttons, this has 4, and the buttons are sorely missed for all of the needed functions of such a headset.  I often get the ""Equalization changed"" message when I am trying to get Siri to pop up...very annoying!  On the plus side, it does seem to connect to my iPhone quickly, and the signal seems pretty stable.All in all, it is nice...but misses in a few ways.****************Update:  After 3 weeks, I returned this to Amazon.

B0002SYC5O,AVPNQUVZWMDSX,"esanta ""esanta""","[4, 6]","I have been a fan of the LG HBS series since the amazingHBS-700and also own theHBS-730and the newHBS-800.With the SF500, Motorola has clearly taken a more than close look at the HBS series and attempted to improve on it. Here's how I find these two compare:- Battery life: Moto wins. This thing keeps on going, and lasts even longer than the already amazing HBS-730. Too bad the remaining battery life estimator is so inaccurate (it reports 4 hours remaining on a full charge, when it's much closer to 10)- Convenience and durability: Moto wins again. The Buds sit tight around your neck and don't bounce. The cords are not as fragile on the LGs, and the magnets holding the earbuds are much stronger on the Moto Buds. Unlike the HBS-730 and 800, the Buds do not report their power level to the Bluetooth host (the iPhone shows a little bar next to the bluetooth icon indicating the battery status when you use the LG headphones). That's funny since the older SF600 have the feature.- Ergonomy: LG wins big time. The button layout and functionality are intuitive and logical on the LG, and completely convoluted and inconvenient on the Buds; on the Buds, the same button is used for FF (one press) or REW (two presses); also, the power button on the LG is a sliding switch, whereas the Buds use an electronic switch which makes it much more difficult to find out if your headset is on or off.- Sound quality: I would rate the Buds somewhere between the 700 and the 730; mostly, they lack bass and presence.- Range: excellent, but the outlandish 150ft range advertised is only available when connected to a Bluetooth Class 1 device, and these are rare -- only featured on a few Motorola phones as far as I could tell. When connected to a Class 2 device (which most devices are) the range is 33ft like all other devices; I think Motorola is a little disingenuous when advertising this extended range.In conclusion... They're not bad, and if the LG series didn't exist they would deserve 5 stars. However, considering they're a blatant rip-off of a successful concept, it's disappointing that Motorola improved on some of the flaws of the HBS series (mostly the cord durability and the magnet strength) but failed to pick up on the ergonomy (button layout, power switch).Which one should you pick? in my opinion, the cheapest one you can find, unless you need to connect to two devices, in which case the Moto Buds or the HBS-800 are a must; and if you easily get irritated and confused by complicated controls, stay away from the Buds.Recommended, but they're not the LG HBS-series killer that Motorola probably designed them to be.",4.0,1397779200,"04 18, 2014",Motorola Buds SF500 Universal Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - White,57.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/310fzxDbttL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 13835},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B0002SYC5O,AEC0BTMNIZZSL,J. Sharp,"[46, 47]","Update: I've been asked how they hold up with sweat (see below). No problem working up a sweat on the treadmill, but I must stress that I've not put in a summer run. I also must say that I do not expect longevity from a non-sweatoroof product, and that the s11 headphones are designed with a sweatproof nano coating. HOWEVER, since you asked, they still sound and work excellent. They bounce around running, but it's not intolerable... Just not ideal.  BATTERY: I've used them every day since I got them, and often times days at the house studying all day and going to the gym.  They last from morning to night constantly connected.  I often forget I'm wearing them when I turn on my music and don't hear any sound from my phone/tablet.Edit: just for the record, the Motorola site says these are NOT for working out (under questions about product, it says not sweatproof and should be kept away from moisture). I'm going to work out in them anyway and I'll report back when they fail.=============================================================I bought the jaybird bluebuds x for my girlfriend, and I've used them several times, so that is my comparison point.These headphones have a very utilitarian, price conscious design. They don't sound as awesome as the $180 bluebuds, and they aren't as sleek as them (bluebuds are just a cord with tiny ear pieces). BUT, they are very easy to control, very light, and sound very good. I'm not taking away anything by saying they don't sound as good as the bluebuds... The bluebuds sound as good as Bose or klipsch wired models of similar cost (even MKBHD says they are amazing). The Motorola buds really sound great. I'd choose them based on sound over any of the cheaper wired sets I have (skull candy, JVC, etc.)The ear pieces, at first, I was worried about them. They didn't look like they would be very secure, but I was wrong. You can easily work out with them and they will stay in. And they swivel a bit at the ear pieces, so every time you move, you don't hear a bunch of thumping like many in-ear wired sets.And taking them out to hear the world around you is nice, because of the magnets. No flopping around.The built-in equalizer settings are nice, the controls are easy, and they stay around your neck when laying on your back.So you sacrifice some portability over the bluebuds, but you get a great ease of use, very good sound, and less than half the price.And truthfully, while they aren't super stylish... People are walking around with those giant beats studio headphones on. These look way less ridiculous than that, and really aren't that bad.

B0002SYC5O,A1ATWEANLT57YG,Van Lam,"[0, 0]","My LG HBS-730 that I use for bike rides with no problem.  Recently, the route I took has a lot of interference from the near by power lines and tower.  Music from LG glitches so much that I can't enjoy my music anymore.  I also have a Plantronics BackBeat Go 2.  This one is a little bit better, but my music still glitches and break up at the area with the most interference.  My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S4 Active and it's stored in my bike jersey back pocket, which is less than two feet from the headset.Before I try this unit, I went and try a LG HBS-750 (one user review said it has less interference).  HBS-750 was worst.  It started to break up even before I enter the interference area.I finally give this one a try.  Wow, I don't know what kind of power they use, I had three rides so far and I haven't experience one single glitch yet.  No music break up, no phone call conversation break up.  It's so nice to finally have some uninterrupted music.I problem I had was that once time, I receive a phone call and the party on the other side couldn't hear me.  I don't know if it's the other party or the headset.  The party calls me back and this time, when I press the pickup button, the headset doesn't respond with button push.The sound is very awesome as well.  I say the bass is better that the HBS-730.  The magnet is stronger as well.  I like it when I tuck the unit behind my shirt and when I am not using the ear plug and let it dangles, it naturally falls down and attached itself back to the magnet of the unit ... through my shirt.

B0002SYC5O,A360VP3RBMJFDL,Voyn238,"[41, 41]","SPOILER ALERT: this is a stupidly long review. I like to provide as much detail as possible when I write a review, because that&#8217;s the sort of thing I look for in other reviews. Buying things from online retailers is great and all, but it prevents us from getting any hands-on information until we&#8217;ve already shelled out our money. Detailed reviews are the best way to combat disappointment and buyers&#8217; remorse. So either get some popcorn and/or a coffee, or skip to the end, or skip this review entirely &#61514;  Seriously though, it&#8217;s a long review. Prepare yourself.This headset is about as close to ideal as I'm probably ever going to get, at least until headsets are implanted subdermally behind the ear, or when music and communications are beamed directly into the brain or something. It has great sound, features, fit, and looks. There are a few downsides which I'll get out of the way first, and then I can get back to gushing about this thing. First, I feel that the earbud cords are maybe .5 to .75 inches too short. I wear this mainly when I&#8217;m at work, underneath the collar of my polo shirt. The cords therefor have to dip down under the edge of the collar, and then make the trip back up to my ears. It's fine if I'm looking straight ahead, but if I turn my head too much it will tug on the 'outside' ear (if I look left, it tugs on my right ear and vice versa). I've gotten around this somewhat by removing the little silicone o-rings that are intended to manage the earbud cords. It releases a little more cord length so the tugging is less noticeable, but it is still there. The cords are a bit short for my taste even when wearing a t-shirt, but aren&#8217;t too bad. The next downside is that the headset does not support connection to two devices at once. I get that this &#8220;one device at a time&#8221; thing improves the handoff between music and calls, since this is easier when both services are provided by one phone/device, but I still wish I could listen to my personal phone's music collection while being able to take calls from my work phone. Other headsets like the Sony MW600 handle this with ease. I should clarify that the Buds can be PAIRED with multiple devices, but can only be connected to one device at a time. Currently, I&#8217;ve got them paired with my Android tablet and phone, my iPod, and my work iPhone. I can switch from one to another by manually disconnecting from one and connecting to another (via each device&#8217;s settings), so I don&#8217;t have to go through the pairing process every time I want to switch &#8211; pairing the Buds is not difficult at all, but that would get annoying real quick.Now that I've got that out of the way, I can talk about the stuff I like about the Buds, which is pretty much everything. First off, let me assure you that this headset DOES support Apt-X Bluetooth connections where available. Apt-X is a Bluetooth audio codec that is designed to provide sound quality equal to a wired headset. Other Bluetooth audio connections have to compress the audio, making it sound somewhat muddled and, well, bad. This happens regardless of the quality of your source audio file. Apt-X support is most commonly available in recent Samsung (including the Galaxy S3, S4, and S5) and HTC phones (including the One and M8), but there are others out there as well. If you&#8217;re interested, there is a ridiculously complete .xlsx spreadsheet available from jessebandersen dot com, but a simple Google search will also yield results. I found Jesse&#8217;s page by searching for &#8220;aptx enabled devices&#8221; &#8211; it was the first result in the list. Sadly Apt-X is not supported by Apple yet, and knowing them they'll come out with some proprietary alternative to it that only works with their own headsets (they bought Beats by Dre in the last week or so, so get ready). I almost passed on the Buds because Apt-X isn't listed anywhere in the specs or reviews that I saw here on Amazon. I had to go to Motorola's site and look up the user manual to find it. I was originally going to go with the LG Tone headset line (which also supports Apt-X), but didn't like the &#34;flat loop&#34; design that most of them have &#8211; it looks like a great fit&#8230; for a robot. In my opinion the Buds are designed for a better fit on an actual human: the front of the control stalks bend gently down, following the curve of the neck/shoulders/collarbones. The majority of the headset (including the very small weight of the battery pack) rests on the base of your neck, and the control stalks rest comfortably near the collarbones. The LG Tone can't do both at the same time since it is formed in a flat circle: the stalks aren&#8217;t angled relative to the neck band, and they carry all the weight of the battery so they&#8217;ll fall to your collarbones while the center section will be halfway up the back of your neck (the newer ones are curved like the Buds, but are $70 more expensive). I&#8217;m wearing the Buds headset right now, and can hardly feel it &#8211; a great improvement over traditional &#8220;earhugger&#8221; Bluetooth headsets. While I&#8217;m talking about fit, I should probably mention that I wear a 17.5&#8221; collar, and can&#8217;t stand having things touching my neck or throat. The Buds fit quite comfortably, and provide just the slightest reassuring touch on the front sides of my neck. They widest gap between the left and right control stalks measures just a hair under 5 inches.The Buds have a tidy control arrangement and are easy to navigate. Play/pause/answer/end/track-skip commands (as well as EQ settings and voice dial activation) are handled by a rocker switch on the left, and volume adjustments are handled by a rocker switch on the right. The microphone is underneath the rocker switch on the left, and the power switch is underneath the body (center section) of the headset, next to the charging port. Play/pause/answer/end is done by a single press of the forward half of the left rocker switch, which has a little bit of texture to it for identification/grip purposes. You can activate voice dialing (like Siri or Samsung&#8217;s S-Voice or Google voice search) by long-pressing this same button while no music is playing. Track-skip forward is done by a single press of the back half of the same switch, and track-skip back is done by a double press. I kind of wish skip forward/back were handled by separate buttons, but it&#8217;s easy enough to get used to. One thing to note about the mic being on the same stalk as the answer/end button: if you have to feel around for the end call button, the person on the other end is going to hear ALL OF IT since the microphone is right beneath it. Lots of loud rustling noises. Oops. Not enough for me to list as a full-on downside, but still... kind of annoying. They could have placed the mic on the right, which come to think of it is a whole lot less &#8220;busy&#8221; since it mostly only has volume control functions. Volume down is achieved by pressing the forward half of the right rocker switch, and volume up by pressing the back half. You can mute an active phonecall by pressing both portions of the volume rocker, and reject an incoming call by long-pressing either one of the volume buttons. EQ modes can be changed by a long-press of the &#8220;Play/Pause&#8221; switch on the left. There are 3 EQ modes, but there is no indication of which one you are in, or documentation of what the effects are supposed to be. There is a voice notification of &#8220;EQ mode changed!&#8221; but that&#8217;s it. You&#8217;re on your own to figure out exactly what that means. My best guess is that the modes are flat, treble boost, and bass boost. As a general &#8220;audiophile&#8221; rule, flat EQ response is best since it doesn&#8217;t meddle with the sound balance and you hear it as the artist intended. I can barely tell which EQ mode is bass boost, but can&#8217;t tell the difference between the other two. And if I can&#8217;t tell the difference, then I guess it doesn&#8217;t really matter. I&#8217;d recommend switching modes while listening to your general type of music, getting to an EQ setting you like, and then never changing it again. As is obvious from the pictures and literature, the earbuds are held magnetically to the ends of the control stalks when not in use. The magnets are pretty strong, and the earbuds have yet to bounce themselves loose. In fact, they are so strong that if I remove an earbud from my ear but don&#8217;t attach it to the end of the stalk, I&#8217;ll eventually find that it has connected itself at some point as I&#8217;ve been moving around. Needless to say, don&#8217;t get any of these parts too close to any of your credit cards.As far as sound quality goes, I&#8217;m really impressed. The earbuds are said to have &#8220;Premium HD speakers&#8221;, and whatever that truly means, they sound great and the Apt-X support really helps them shine. I should point out that the Buds will still sound great with non-Apt-X devices like Apple gadgets, and will certainly sound as good as all other Bluetooth headsets that don&#8217;t support it. As long as the earbuds are seated properly (which is critical with any in-ear earbuds) bass response is nice and solid, and everything just sort of sparkles. Not saying that &#8220;sparkle&#8221; is added in any way, but if the music has fine detail in it then you&#8217;ll hear a lot more of it. Speaking of having the earbuds seated properly, the documentation talks a bit about about &#8220;micro-adjustability&#8221;, and what this translates into is that the stem of each earbud can pivot a certain amount around a central axis in a sort of narrow cone shape, so the angle of the stem relative to the earbud&#8217;s body can change a bit to fit different peoples&#8217; ear structures. The earbuds seem to stay fairly well seated unless I get really sweaty. Speaking of sweat, I will also note that the Buds are not labelled as &#8220;sweat proof&#8221;, which does make me worry a little bit. I sweat easily, and do a lot of biking and walking, and my work is somewhat physical too. Hopefully this does not become an issue. There is a little rubber plug you have to partially remove to access the charging port, so make sure you place it back securely before getting sweaty. Anyways, back to audio quality: One important thing to note, which is true of all high quality sound delivery devices, is that the final output depends highly on good source material. You should know by now that low quality sources like 128Kbps .mp3 files or even some tracks on Pandora and other streaming services aren&#8217;t the best, and with these you will hear every little bit of their badness. Other headsets may mask this but they&#8217;re also masking the fine detail of better quality files, so in a way it&#8217;s actually a good thing. Call quality on both ends of the line is really good as well, and I&#8217;ve never had anyone ask &#8220;Are you using Bluetooth?&#8221; which I usually get when I use other headsets. In fact, I had one person stop me in mid-conversation and ask &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say you were going to put on your bluetooth headset?&#8221;, and almost didn&#8217;t believe me when I said I already had. One last thing about audio quality &#8211; if you listen to music via any app with preamp gain, you may want to be reduce that gain level to zero. I use PowerAmp on my Galaxy S4 and was dismayed at first to hear a ton of distortion, especially in the low end. I almost returned the headset because I could not get rid of it. I eventually found that the preamp gain (on PowerAmp&#8217;s EQ settings page) was set to about 75% of its capacity, and turning it down eliminated the distortion completely. You can get rid of the distortion at 25%, but why risk it? I keep it at zero now just to be sure. Doing so also reduced the overall volume, but since these things get plenty loud on their own, I don&#8217;t mind at all.Usually I hate the looks of most Bluetooth headsets: the obnoxious blinking blue lights and the giant blobs of techno-crud clamped to peoples&#8217; ears make them look like extras from bad 80&#8217;s sci-fi movies. I have to say that the Motorola Buds practically disappear, especially while wearing them under the collar of a polo shirt. They do have an indicator light, but it is nestled in between the power switch and charging port, so it&#8217;s not visible at all while they&#8217;re being worn. I have to say, at first I wasn&#8217;t too pleased with the fact that even the black headset has white bits on it (the undersides of the flat cords, the silicone ear pieces, and the forward/inside halves of the earbud shells). I have changed my mind and have very much come to enjoy the subtle high-contrast design. It looks nice and modern without looking like it&#8217;s trying too hard. As I said, it practically disappears under a polo collar &#8211; all you can see is the white silicone ear pieces and a touch of the white from the cord. When you&#8217;ve got an earbud inserted, the white flash from the undersides of the cords help make it a little more obvious to others that you&#8217;re either listening to music or talking on the phone. I say &#8220;a little&#8221; because people still give me weird looks when they walk into a room while I&#8217;m in mid conversation. I have to make the universal &#8220;I&#8217;m not a lunatic, I&#8217;m just on the phone&#8221; gesture to most folks, but the observant ones can figure it out for themselves more easily. I see these now come in blue, which makes me even more sad that they don&#8217;t come in red. You see, I have a sickness. A sickness which has yet to be defined (or even acknowledged) by Science, in which I have an overwhelming love (some, like my wife, would say &#8220;unhealthy obsession&#8221;) for black things with red trim, or red things with black trim, or&#8230;  well, you get the idea. If these came in red, I&#8217;d sell 4 of my 5 pints of blood (or at least my black/white Buds) to get a set. Maybe one day.Those are the main points I wanted to talk about. There are a few more things that don&#8217;t really fit in the review elsewhere, so I&#8217;ll stick them here. The specs say that the wireless range is up to 150 feet, but that is with a &#8220;Class 1 Bluetooth device&#8221;, which your phone probably isn&#8217;t. Realistic use is still around 30 to 40 feet, with minor barriers like walls and doors. I don&#8217;t even know where to find a true Class 1 Bluetooth device, so get that 150ft range spec out of your head. Battery life seems to be pretty good, and although I try to charge the headset every night, I&#8217;ve gone as far as 2 full workdays of mixed usage without running out of battery. They&#8217;re rated at &#8220;up to 12 hours&#8221; of playback, but it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess as to what that actually means. I talked about the silicone earpieces earlier, but forgot to mention that they come in 3 sizes &#8211; small, medium, and large. The Buds come with the small ones installed already, but I found that the mediums were best for me. The earpieces on most of my other earbuds (both wired and wireless) are 99% interchangeable, but these are slightly different. The posts on the ear stems are a slightly smaller diameter than standard, so earpieces from other sets are a bit loose. Swapping other earpieces to the Buds would result in more sound leakage and result in poorer sound quality and bass response, and also put you at a much higher risk of having one of the earpieces coming off the stem and sticking in your ear. Trust me, you don&#8217;t want that. Stick to the 3 sizes provided and find the one that best suits you. Use the biggest size you can stand, because a good seal is critical for good sound quality. Another thing I mentioned briefly was the Buds&#8217; voice notifications. The Buds have a set of pre-programmed voice notifications built in that you&#8217;ll hear as you turn the headset on and off, or change EQ settings, and maybe a few other commands. When you power it up, the headset plays a short musical tune and then a chipper female voice says &#8220;Welcome to the Motorola Buds!&#8221; When you connect to a phone or mp3 player, the same voice says &#8220;Device 1 connected!&#8221; The voice isn&#8217;t too bad, but it took me a while to get used to. When you receive a phone call, it will play another tune at you instead of mirroring your phone&#8217;s ringtone. I think it&#8217;s a riff on the first few notes of &#8220;Ride of the Valkyries&#8221; but I could be wrong. The Buds also play a soft &#8220;bloop&#8221; noise every time you play or pause or adjust the volume. Other than these &#8220;bloop&#8221; noises, there is really no indication of whether or not the unit is even powered up. I mention this because if the headset loses connection it will automatically power down after 5 minutes to save battery. If you pick the headset up after a while and don&#8217;t know what power state it&#8217;s in, hit a volume button and listen for the bloop. The headset has yet to drop Bluetooth connection on its own, which is a first for all the headsets I&#8217;ve owned and is kind of impressive. The very last thing I wanted to talk about (yeah, I made a list) is that there are very thin rubber strips that run up the undersides of each control stalk, which I think serve the purpose of covering the track the wires run through. A small section of one of these strips popped up after about a week and would not seat itself back down. I eventually decided that they are probably held in place by some sort of adhesive, since I could not get it to &#8220;pop back in&#8221;, so I placed the tiniest dab of Krazy Glue in there, wiped off the excess, and held it in place until it dried. This was about a month ago, and it has not popped back up yet.So that&#8217;s absolutely every observation about the Motorola Buds that I&#8217;ve made since I got them. If you&#8217;ve read through all that, I salute you. I probably owe you 20 minutes of your life back. Sorry about that. Now on to the summary, which I promised at the start:For the tl;dr crowd, I wholly approve of this headset. It&#8217;s the headset I&#8217;ve been waiting quite some time for, and it&#8217;s finally here. Features, fit, sound, and looks are all pretty much perfect, and it&#8217;s hard to come up with a list of serious disadvantages. As I write this, it&#8217;s available here for $58, which is quite a steal. The nearest competitor is the LG HBS-800, which normally goes for $130. Check these out &#8211; I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll be disappointed.",5.0,1401580800,"06 1, 2014",Motorola Buds SF500 Universal Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - White,57.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/310fzxDbttL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 13835},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

The phone I received from Amazon.com was made for the Hong Kong market, so it came with a outlet plug adapter for U.S. customers.  (The AC adapter itself is universal voltage, and the slim paper manual is in English.)  The phone is quadband and fully unlocked, so it can be used anywhere in the world.I really like the RAZR phone.  It's very solid and the voice quality is excellent.  Speak Out Wireless runs on AT&T; and T-Mobile networks so the reception quality can vary, but overall the RAZR does an excellent job in pulling in as much signal as possible.  As with other Moto phones, the brightness of the screen can be adjusted, and the ringer type and volume can be easily changed.  The metallic keypad takes a little getting used to, but is pretty comfy to use.The camera is only VGA but takes good-quality pictures when there's plenty of light.  Video capture is jerky and limited to 15 seconds, so that's probably the weakest feature for me.  Bluetooth linkup to a Sony Ericsson earpiece works fine.  Battery life is admirable; I don't use the phone much, maybe just 10 minutes a week, and I need to recharge it once every 8 days or so.Because I've owned many Moto's before so I like the RAZR's interface, since it feels familiar, but I can understand how it can confuse users new to the Moto scene.  Overall, though, I don't think it's harder to use than a Sony or Nokia.What really impresses me is the build quality of this phone.

Now this new battery I got to get a full week again after full charge, being unplugged for three hours after one five minute phone call if it was that, was in the red (battery dead).  Makes no sense charged it yesterday and haven't had any calls or made, and it still shows three bars (seventeen or so hours later)  contacted the company to let them know it dies quickly with just one call, they said they needed my phone number for more info (sent it).  Then checked the second email from them on the same day they were both sent, which said sorry, mass volume business, replacements already been sent. (don't know why they wanted my number, lol) they were on it so if this comes and works fine I'll say five for quality and five for customer service.  (note:sfplanets ipod replacement headphones for 1.99 have serious issues, both right sided, one side tinny, they couldn't send me a good pair twice, gave up for two bucks I'll ware a hat to keep in the rightees, and tiny one works just sounds funny on one side, anyway this is not them)  If it doesn't work or is the same as the one they sent, I'll give a two I guess just for the good quick customer service, and use my old battery at least it gets three good phone calls.  Remember got a cheap replacement phone just to get by is my only phone so it's needed and don't want to pay full retail for a new in factory plasic battery.  Plus I guess I've got the one phone call battery and the new one which well see what that is and despite inconvenience I may carry them as back up for certain scenarios, just to be able to make one last call so to say.  Hate doing that though, be nice if stuff just worked fine, first one ordered did.  Oh, I'm gonna talk to my dad and have him check his amazon records to find out who he bought it from and order one from them if this replacement doesn't work.

I think if I can find a long microphone wire to wire the microphone to somewhere facing the driver mouth and replace the speaker with a larger one, it might work well.  Of source I have to disable the internal 4V lithium ion battery to let car battery provide the power, so that when car power off, it will stop working. I need to insert a small delay circuit, so that when car powering on, it will turn on the T305.I wish Motorola making the modification for it, that will make people's life a lot easier:1) make the bluetooth car kit powering on when USB power is on and powering off when USB power is off;2) Make a microphone jack so that user can extend the microphone wire to somewhere they like microphone to be.For under $30, this is a very good device.

I was tempted to purchase a Sony Ericsson HCB-100 since I have a Sony Ericsson K790A, but opted not to because it was half-duplex and I would have to order it. I wanted a full duplex speakerphone that could be purchased from a brick and mortar store in case I wanted to return it because it sucked that bad.Despite reading the poor reviews here, I took a calculated risk in purchasing the T305 from a local Best Buy. Calculated as in I was banking on Motorola's reputation to not steer me wrong.It has been a day so far and I can say that I am satisfied. I can hear the caller clearly, vice versa. My girlfriend event commented how I sounded better than my Plantronics 640 headseat. It makes me wonder about the poor reviews in that regard. My SWAG is that the phone and bluetooth connection makes up 50% of the whole. If the phone is crappy or the bluetooth connection is flaky, then of course it is going to suck. Of course, it is also inevitable for lemons to get past manufacturing QA.The reason why I gave it a 4-stars and not a 5 is because of the other negatives that have been mentioned already:1- big blinking blue light, but that's trivial because I can tune it out like I tune out my girlfriend;2- no wall charger, but that's also trivial because I already have at least a couple mini-USB chargers from other devices I have;3- I can not get the voice dialing working, but that's ok because I bought the car kit to answer calls, not make them.It may seem like I am justifying the negatives, but ultimately they really do not bother me such that it is a deal breaker.

B000JKKE5M,A1N5FSCYN4796F,"Philip R. Heath ""Gadgets, Music, & Books""","[445, 448]","I was looking for a replacement for my bluetooth headset when I started looking at bluetooth speakerphones.  After doing some research, I was looking for the following:* No installation - I wanted to use it in multiple vehicles/locations* Reasonable price* Trusted brand* Good sound quality* Easy to useI am happy to report that the T305 does a good (sometimes great) job of satisfying my requirements.  Here's a look at how it has performed:Setup - Upon opening the box, there are really two things to do:  insert the visor clip which is easily secured and use the car charger that comes with the unit.  While the instructions said that charging could take up to two hours, my unit fully charged in about 30 minutes.  Once complete, simply power on the device, and it automatically enters pairing mode.  I was able to find it with my LG VX-9900 (see my review) with no problems at all.Use - Coming from a background of using headsets, I must say that I cannot imagine going back.  I really like not having anything hanging on my ear (and sometimes inserted in my ear depending on the headset).  This model also seems geared toward the people who use headsets because the operation is very similar.  One nice thing is that the power button is separate from the multi-function button.  With my 9900, I am able to initiate voice dialing from the speakerphone and with the 9900 set to auto-answer, calls are automatically transferred after 2 seconds.  The volume controls on the sides are easily accessible and operate similar to most headsets.  I never have to touch my phone at all so it truly is hands-free.Call Quality - All of the above is meaningless if the calls don't sound good, right?  Well, have no fear.  The call quality for both parties is better than any headset that I have ever used - and I've used six different ones over last 2 years.  Some of this has to do with positioning.  In the Texas heat, most people have their AC on a high setting.  Unfortunately, most headsets are positioned directly in line with the air flow.  However with a visor clip-on of this speakerphone, this is not the case.  Add to that the noise canceling technology, and the people on the other end hardly know that they are on speakerphone at all.  On my end, the volume is more than adequate.  It's really a simple matter of physics - the speaker is bigger here than it is on a headset.Cons - So what's the catch?  As I mentioned earlier, the device only ships with a car charger.  I ordered (rather cheaply) a wall charger to compensate for this.  While it was annoying, it wasn't the end of the world.  Others have mentioned the flashing blue light.  I have to admit that the first time I was driving in the dark, it was initially distracting.  However, I got used to it rather quickly, and I don't notice it anymore.  I would compare it to getting a new car that has a loud turn signal.  You notice it a lot at first, but you learn to tune it out.  Also, it does not have a display, but then again, neither do headsets.  Finally, I use it in a similar manner to a headset.  I take it with me when I get out of the car, and I power it off between uses.  It's not an integrated speakerphone so it isn't tied to your car's power supply like more sophisticated (and expensive) models.  None of these are deal-breakers for me.Bottom line - If you are looking for a good alternative to bluetooth headsets, and you intended use pattern will be similar to that of a headset, then this is what you are looking for.  It has great quality, and it's easy to use.",4.0,1192665600,"10 18, 2007",Motorola T305 Bluetooth Portable Car Speaker,60.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BZIkCoYfL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 51710},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Car Accessories', 'Car Speakerphones']]"

Basically perfect except for my cons..Cons:  Huge blinking blue light is annoying at night and invisible during the day.  Sometimes it take a second for it to answer a call when you click the answer button.  I guess the solution for that is probably to wait a few seconds after answering before saying ""hello"".  This flaw also demonstrates itself when using VZ Navigator, because it cuts off the first word of driving instructions.  This flaw might be from my MOTOKRZR phone and not from the T305, but I don't have any way to know which end causes it.Another reviewer stated that the ""on/off"" button is too small.  When I first read that, I didn't know why it matters.  I now know.  At least with a MOTOKRZR (and I'd assume other phones), the speaker on your phone will be inactive when it is connected via Bluetooth to your T305.  With 150 feet of range, it actually stays connected if you are 150 feet from your car.  Therefore you have to turn it off every time you get out of the car, or else you won't be able to hear calls you receive on your phone.  It isn't a huge deal, and something you can get used to, but Motorola should have either made the on/off button more accessible or cut the Bluetooth range down to about 15 feet.Overall the best handsfree solution for talking in the car.

B000JKKE5M,A3NEAETOSXDBOM,Stephen M. Charme,"[1, 1]","I was looking for a no frills car speaker to use with my BlackBerry Tour that was easily portable between different cars, easy to use, and had good sound quality for speaking and listening. The T305 did the trick.Pairing this with my Tour was quick and effortless. Using it is a breeze. I just hit the phone button to receive a call and my speed dial buttons to dial frequently called numbers. Voice activated calling also works, though I tend not to use that.This is a small unit that clips unobtrusively and easily to the visor for easy installation and removal. The people I call say that my voice is clearer than when I was using a headset. I can also hear them more clearly.Let me address some critiques mentioned in other reviews, none of which should deter you from buying this unit:1. There is no AC charger, only a cigarette lighter charger with a micro USB plug on one end. True, but there are lots of gadgets you can buy to power electronic gadgets via a USB cable and AC outlet (I own several; one of my favorites is the Tekkeon MP-1800, which I use for this unit as well as my iPod Touch, Tour, and Slacker G2).Also, if you have a USB 2.0 A-Male to Mini-B cable (which costs only a few dollars on Amazon) you can charge this unit via the USB port on your computer.2. The power switch is tiny. True, but it really is not difficult to turn this on and off (and it shuts off automatically after 30 minutes when not paired with your phone, which happens when you leave the car and get far enough away).3. There is a flashing blue light to indicate that the unit is connected to the phone (and my Tour also has a flashing blue light while it is connected to the speaker). True, but if it bothers you just put a piece of black electrical tape over it (though I would not cover it completely so that when you charge this unit, you can tell when the charging light turns from red to blue to indicate a full charge).4. The unit does not automatically turn on and sync with your phone when you get into the car. True, but it is not really a big deal to turn it on.Bottom line: This unit cost less than half the sale price of my fancy blue tooth headset and is both easier and clearer for me to use. In addition, since pairing with a phone is required only once, you can use this with multiple phones (though obviously not at the same time), which is handy when my wife wants to borrow it for occasional use. The only adjustment on this unit is the volume, but that is all that I was looking for. For a ""plain vanilla"" unit I recommend this.Update April 7, 2010: I now place this unit next to the center console so that I can connect it via a USB cable to a charging unit by my console that I use for my electronic gadgets, which keeps this unit charged all the time. The sound quality is still fine (I made a test call to my home answering machine). I also like not having this unit visible on my visor lest someone mistake it for a GPS and break into my car to steal it.",5.0,1268870400,"03 18, 2010",Motorola T305 Bluetooth Portable Car Speaker,60.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BZIkCoYfL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 51710},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Car Accessories', 'Car Speakerphones']]"

The only moving part is the push-switch that pushes out the mini-USB to plug into the charger port on the phone. The light appropriately glows when the unit is charging and charging a phone. It is too bulky to fit comfortably in a pocket for an extended period but perfect to keep in any small carrying bag. It would fit in a typical car ash-tray.Droid X and other micro-USB port owners MUST buy a miniUSB(F)-to-microUSB(M) adapter.The unit plugs into the adapter which plugs into the phone.

Once I confirmed that the unit will charge the battery enough for use, I did not see how long it took to charge, how many recharges I could get, or how long the unit will hold it's own charge.Now, with that all said, the only place to comfortably accomplish this is to leave the phone and unit sitting quietly on top of a desk or other surface.

The Motorola charges my phone pretty fast without over heating it even when I stream online radio through my car's Bluetooth and use GPS on the phone at the same time.

B000S5Q9CA,A2I18AO597DSDI,"David Pearlman ""sound fanatic""","[1656, 1693]","There are so many sketchy sellers selling phone chargers out there, that it can be a bit scary. The problem is that if the charger is poorly made, the output of the charger can be out of spec and can, in some cases, fry the phone you connect to it.For that reason, when it comes to phone chargers, you should stick to name brands. (They are all made in China, but the name brand ones are usually subject to stricter QA).When I found this charger on Amazon, SOLD BY AMAZON, I jumped on it. It's a MICRO USB car charger, made for Motorola and sold under the Motorola name, in retail packaging. The rated output is 4.75-5.25V and 950mA.This charger should work fine with most any phone that uses the MICRO USB connector. The key number to pay attention to is the second one, the rated amperage. This is the MAXIMUM amount of current that the phone can request from the charger. A typical USB port on a PC provides as little as 100mA, and few provide more than 500mA. So this charger should charge your phone faster than when it's connected to a PC. A few phones out now can use up to 1000mA. But that just means they CAN use that amount. If 950mA is provided, they'll still charge, just a bit more slowly.Note that the amperage (second number) merely tells you how much the charger CAN supply, if requested. The phone itself is responsible for asking for the current. That is to say, if this charger can provide 950mA, but your phone can only use 300mA--no problem. Your phone asks for 300mA and the charger provides all of what is requested. If, on the other hand, your phone can use 1000mA, this charger will provide all it can, which is 950mA--a wee bit less than the max asked for. That's also not a problem; it just means your phone will charge a little bit (not much in this case) more slowly. The rated voltage for this charger is presented in a range of 4.75-5.25V. The ""ideal"" voltage for a USB charger of any type if 5V. And most chargers for home use are rated right at 5V. But car chargers work in a noisier environment and thus you have the range. This is where a cheapo charger can really do damage, as some of them are poorly regulated and can provide voltages that are WAY out of spec. Again, when you can get a name brand charger from a seller you can trust (Amazon) for such a reasonable price, it's very foolish to consider the cheapo no-names.This is an excellent quality name brand travel micro USB charger at a price that beats the no-name junk from third party sellers. What's not to like?BE SURE TO ORDER IT FROM AMAZON AND NOT ONE OF THE THIRD PARTY SELLERS, as some of those have been known to make mistakes with respect to what they ship relative to the listing. I can confirm that Amazon is shipping the P513 /89143N charger, as pictured.",4.0,1276214400,"06 11, 2010",Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter micro-USB Rapid Rate Charger,8.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41noIKEcGGL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 148},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories']]"

B000S5Q9CA,A2V7EO331SFUF6,D.B. Spalding,"[2, 2]","I bought this direct from Amazon (Prime shipping, 2-day was free), and received the charger in OEM packaging (not retail packaging) the next day. (I love Prime!) The inner bag identifies it as a SPN5400A, part #11224-0817337; both numbers are on the charger, though the second is 11224-CC-0817337, and also has CHR-0291 imprinted on it. (Check the image gallery.) The outer bag carried the part #PVN1616, and a barcoded number, 760492-013772, I don't know what those are, stocking codes?As demonstrated in another buyer's video review, the MicroUSB plug has a holographic QA sticker (doesn't have Motorola logo, just a ""check mark"" graphic). The obverse of the plug has the Motorola ""M"" clearly and cleanly molded into it. The plug is molded as one, solid piece. The charger portion is okay, nothing fancy or super-solid, but it holds together. Part numbers are clearly printed on it. It also has a handy little clip on the cord (visible in the first product image) that lets you keep the cord together, either in storage or in use.Pardon the pun, but the proof is in the plug-in. As measured on my HTC Amaze 4G, this charger provides up to 800mA of charging current while plugged into an AC adapter, compared with 400mA from a similar Duracell car charger. In my car, the charger provides slightly less, but still sufficient to charge the phone while Waze is working (which uses the display, GPS receiver, and 4G network for maps). This is what I've been looking for, as other lesser chargers actually let the phone's battery drain down due to insufficient charging current. A charger that provides ~800mA - 900mA means the difference of an hour or so LESS to completely charge up, compared with a ~300mA - 400mA charger, if the phone is not in use.Because so many buyers of this and other chargers complain of counterfeit or substituted products for what are listed as OEM replacements, I urge you to buy only direct from Amazon. Ensure the transaction is covered by Amazon's usual product return guarantee, so that if you do get a substitution or fake, you can return it for a full refund, without paying for shipping. Until Amazon cracks down on sellers' misleading listings, you are really walking into the lion's den slathered with A-1 sauce when you take a chance on a third party seller, just to save a few dollars.",5.0,1333843200,"04 8, 2012",Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter micro-USB Rapid Rate Charger,8.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41noIKEcGGL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 148},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories']]"

Rather than spend the $30 Verizon wants for their branded chargers, I ordered this charger for under $6. It appears to be of pretty high quality and charges my Motorola Barrage and my wife's Motorola Droid with no problems. There are only two negatives. The body of the unit is fairly long and bulky, sticking much farther out of the dash than the Verizon charger. Also, the futuristic-looking blue illuminated Motorola logo is huge, and at night it is so bright it can be a little distracting. I have found that if I turn the charger 90 degrees to either side, I can no longer see the huge gleaming logo.UPDATE: I just ordered another of these chargers which are of impressive quality for the money. The first one lasted nearly three years and just recently stopped charging my phones. In addition to the phones mentioned above, it has also worked well with our Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX and our Blackberry Bold.

B000S5Q9CA,A3MPOPREPBPUR9,Good Times,"[1, 2]","This is an original Motorola charger. It will fit any phone with a Micro USB charging port. (HTC Evo, Droid Incredible, Droid X, etc.)This charger is a high output, rapid charger. It will deliver up to 950mA of power. Most of the newer smart phones can draw 1A of power, so this charger will work perfectly for them. It will show on your phone as an AC power charge. This will charge your phone quickly and easily, even with multiple apps running, including GPS navigation and 4G.If your phone charges at less than 1A, that is still fine. It will NOT overcharge your phone. The charger can deliver UP TO 950mA, which means it will only deliver what is asked of it. If your phone only pulls 500mA, then it will only deliver 500mA.The construction quality is great. It seems solid and well built. I fully expect this to last a long time. It is a very attractive design, with stylish blue lighting. I don't know the exact length, but the cord is longer than most, and supple. It will easily and comfortably reach anywhere on or around the front seat.My girlfriend and I both have this charger, and we've both used them extensively. I can personally attest to its ability to fully charge while using GPS navigation, 4G, and running multiple apps during an extended 7 hour drive across the state. Using both her Incredible, and my Evo.This is a great price for such a quality cable. You should not be paying 20.00 dollars or more from the major phone carriers. Buy this, and you will be more than satisfied in every way. This is a much bette cable than anything the carriers sell.I am completely thrilled with this cable, and will not hesitate to recommend them to anyone, and purchase them as needed for gifts for others.Hope that helps...",5.0,1295136000,"01 16, 2011",Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter micro-USB Rapid Rate Charger,8.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41noIKEcGGL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 148},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories']]"

Even with the standard factory car charger (which is 500 ma), the battery still drains while the phone is being used as a GPS.After doing some research I came across this charger (which supplies 950ma) and from the buzz online it seemed like it would do the trick for me.  Well, it's an improvement over the standard 500ma charger, though not perfect.I find that on full brightness - which is typical of what you'll need for daytime car GPS usage - the battery still drains even when using this charger.  Bummer.  To be fair, the drain is much lower than the standard 500ma charger, and drastically less than using no charger at all, but the battery still slowly drops nonetheless.  If you drop the screen brightness, or turn the screen off for extended highway drives, then the battery drop all but ceases.So that is only a minor drawback.  A bigger drawback for me is that on several occasions my phone has overheated and frozen while using this charger with my phone's GPS fuction.  This required me unplugging the charger and rebooting my phone to remedy.  This is a HUGE pain when you are behind the wheel and driving somewhere you are unfamiliar with.  Keep in mind the standard 500ma charger would have no such overheating problems.  Apparently the engineers at Samsung specified the 500ma current in order to maintain full functionality of the phone under all conditions - even car GPS usage.  Anything over that is not within spec and could cause the phone to overheat under certain circumstances.That said, I am still fairly happy with the charger.  So long as I am not doing anything intensive with the phone in the car, it charges my phone very rapidly with no problems what so ever.

It did seem to charge faster than other auto chargers I have used.  One minor issue is that the blue lighting produced by the charger is somewhat distracting while driving at night. It is bright and can produce glare in the driver's peripheral vision.  This is easily solved by either placing tape over the light source, or just turning it sideways.  The charger worked great hooked up to my Droid X auto mount for over a year, but recently started working only part of the time and needs to be jiggled to get it to work.

I've gone through a couple of off-brand chargers that seemed to break after a year of use that cost a few bucks more than this one.

After a longer period of time, while my comments on the durability / construction of the charger remain valid, the power output is pretty minimal and I am changing my rating from a 4 star to a 3 star: charging my Motorola phone takes a heck of a long time if the power level is less than 50% and, for example, when it isdown to 20% and plugged in during a two-hour drive, it consistently never gets above 50% charged.",3.0,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter micro-USB Rapid Rate Charger,8.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41noIKEcGGL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 148},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories']]"

So why should you pay top dollar when you know you'll only get enough use out of it until your next upgrade, generally two years at the most? But if you spend a few minutes doing your research, you'll find this car charger for your Droid Incredible. It's perfect! It has the Motorola branding and the price is about one-fifth what you'd pay at the Verizon store or in a Best Buy.It charges your Incredible pretty quickly. I recently was at 2% battery life. I hooked this charger up, went and did my 35 minute workout at the gym. When I returned to my car, the battery was at a 94% charge. Not bad.The Incredible is a great smart phone.

B000S5Q9CA,A3VS7IZZVC6337,Ted Pavlic,"[1, 1]","Note that I purchased this charger directly from Amazon and not from one of the other shippers. After being pleased with the first one, I tried to purchase 2 more, but Amazon limited me to 1. I purchased the third charger from another shipper, and I worry that it won't be authentic.I received this charger in a baggie containing a statement of Motorola warranty. On the underside of the charger, the input/output electrical specifications were given in Spanish. So I think this product comes from a Spanish Motorola inventory. The electrical specifications clearly state an output current of 950mA at 4.75--5.25V. There is a plastic clip (visible in the picture) on onside of the coil that lets the coil fold in two. That helps keep cable management clean in the car.On my way to work this morning, with my HTC Rezound smartphone initially charged to 90%, I turned on navigation and left the screen on. The sun was out, and so the phone became warm in its windshield mount. Nonetheless, I arrived at work with the phone at 94% and starting to pulse its current draw to reduce incoming current. So the charger did its job nicely.So I am very happy with this charger. For under $6, it's a high-rate charger from a recognizable source.The low price and the fact that Amazon limits the number a single buyer can purchase makes me think that this charger will soon not be available for sale. Get it while you can. Nice unit (if you get the real version from Moto). Hopefully it lasts for a while.SIDE NOTE: If you are looking for a dual-output charger suitable for tablets, I also have recently tried the ""Mediabridge High Output Dual USB Car Charger (3.1 Amp)"" and was pretty pleased with it.

Although Amazon LLC sells the item, it's over one-third more than other sellers. Before buying, I contacted Amazon customer service and they said I would get a full, no questions asked refund if the phone did not work with my SIM card if I used either Amazon or an Amazon Fulfillment seller. So I went for such a seller, less than Amazon LLC but not the rock-bottom cheapest.What I received appeared to be in brand new condition: the box was sealed, and so were all the bags inside. The charger has a US plug but can be used overseas. The battery appeared to be new too, and after being charged under three hours held it for over 36 hours.  The phone was unlocked, but T-Mobile branded. It worked with both my T-Mobile SIM and a UK (English) pay-as-you-go SIM.I wanted a quad band, unlocked GSM cell phone for overseas travel.  This phone fits the bill, and the aesthetics are nice.  Folded, the phone is quite pocketable.  Open, the size is easy enough to manage.  Both the exterior and huge interior screens are color.  The lighted keypad looks like ""Tron"" in its use of a blue florescent design.The owner's manual is quite skimpy and cheaply printed as other reviewers suggest. But I was able to download the full manual as a PDF from Motorola's web site.  The supplied manual is small enough to keep in a wallet while travelling, though.I didn't try sending an MMS, but received one or two of SMS advertisements, so text messaging works.  If you want a phone for overseas travel that will work in almost any country with a local SIM card, consider this one.  As long as you buy from Amazon LLC or use a seller with Amazon Fulfillment, you a) probably will not have any problems and b) will at least get a no questions asked refund with the seller paying return shipping if what you receive does not work as described.",5.0,1322006400,"11 23, 2011","Motorola RAZR V3 Unlocked Phone with Camera, and Video Player - U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",56.75,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41294T68YJL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 6314},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones'], ['Sports & Outdoors', 'Fan Shop', 'Cell Phone Accessories']]"

It cost just a little more for OEM and a quality charger, so why buy a cheap charger for your phone?",5.0,1315440000,"09 8, 2011",Motorola Wall Charger EMU/Mini USB Rapid Rate Charger,8.75,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418g568MJ8L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 37429},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Travel Chargers']]"

It's value decreased considerably if the price is much higher.This has about the same footprint as my iPhone.  It's about a fraction of it's weight.  Build quality is excellent.  The speaker contains a rechargeable battery and there is a clear indication of when it needs to be charged and when the charging has been completed.  More on the charger and that ""clear indication"" in a bit.Pairing with my iPhone was immediate right out of the box.  I turned on the speaker, went to the bluetooth discover screen on my phone, it picked up the unpaired device, I entered the super-secret code number (0000), and it was done.Sound quality is good (for this type of speaker).  The sound is clear, there is very little (but at least some) bass, and it doesn't sound tinny.  I bought it for playing background music on the deck and it's certainly clear enough and there's definitely enough volume for that.The description implied and it should be clearly stated that in addition to working as a speaker this also works as a speaker phone and can also pass voice commands to the phone.  In fact it works just like the Motorola S9 headset except that forward and reverse don't seem to work with my iPhone4 (and it's much more difficult to wear as a headset).The AC charger is universal (at one end); it accepts 100-240V at 50/60 Hz.Now for the minor issues:There's a very bright and annoying light that insists on flashing when music is playing. According to the (well written) manual it means there's either a call or music on standby.  Near as I can tell there isn't.  This can be easily ""fixed"" with electrical or duct tape.  :)If you want to charge the speaker from your laptop or USB charger you need to supply your own mini-USB (laptop/charger end) to micro-USB (speaker end) cable.Minor annoyances aside, this speaker is a good value.  You can share music from your mobile device at good volume and reasonable fidelity while keeping said mobile device on your person.  I haven't tried the wired connection and frankly if I was looking for that kind of speaker I'm sure there are plenty available that would cost less while providing the same sound quality.BTW, I feel that honest, effective reviews can take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping.

It works well and does have louder sound than the laptop speakers, but not quite enough for what I was looking for, so I experimented with it as a speaker phone for my DROID and that's where it really shines. Good value and great sound for a small group of three or four on a conference call and the noise canceling microphone works great. I carry it in my computer bag all the time to use for impromptu conference calling. But, I bout this for $29 and now I see it's listed at $50. I wouldn't have bought it for $50.Meantime, I'm still experimenting with a solution for the PowerPoint presentations.

B001CK5XEA,A6FIAB28IS79,Samuel Chell,"[0, 0]","This is a nicely designed, well-constructed, handy and effective wireless speaker, its built-in rechargeable battery adding to its usefulness.  I've mated it with an iPod Touch while listening to a downloaded audible text on long car trips.  Music is a wholly different story.  I'm no fan of the bass-heavy recordings, but I still appreciate being able to identify the pitches of an acoustic bass not to mention the touch and tone of individual players.  I'm afraid this little speaker is simply incapable of accessing the lower regions of the frequency range.Without moving too far out of this price range, the audible difference between the EQ5 and EQ7 is night and day when it comes to music.  In fact, the Motorola EQ7 is one of the most overlooked, underrated giants among personal wireless speakers.  Otherwise, the Logitech Z515 and Creative D100 are worthy, if notably larger sized, speakers.  Also, some speakers-- especially those made by Sprach and Tanqa--are not only wireless but produce more bass and at a lower price than the EQ5 (though you'll have difficulty finding one that has the pocket-sized compactness of the EQ5).",4.0,1290729600,"11 26, 2010",Motorola MOTOROKR EQ5 Bluetooth Portable Speaker,59.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41c6tCwBQnL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 165063},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Bluetooth Speakers']]"

B001CK5XEA,A2P66E1ULH1M9H,"ZBatia ""cyber teacher""","[0, 0]","I have spent about an hour researching what would be the best in-car speakerphone for my Samsung Captivate phone. Based on comments, I have decided to order one. After one week of using:Cons:1. Hey, it does a good job as soon as you synchronized your phone (easy process)2. The sound quality is good3. The sound volume is acceptable (I was able to clearly hear the voice while was driving in my SUV). When I played a music, I could regulate the volume on my phone, and it was amplified to a quite loud sound.4. To answer the phone - all you have to do is to press the button on the top of a speakerphone. If you listen the music (it was an audio book in my case), if somebody is calling, you can hear the beeps while the music volume is automatically goes down.5. When you have the sync, the green light is slowly blinking, so you know it's in the operating mode.6. Acceptable, compact size7. Lithium battery that can be recharged (I have also purchased the car adapter with compatible USB port)8. Price comparing to competitors' prices.Cons:1. For instance, today I had to turn on/off my unit two times until the green light started blinking (a sync problem or just a minor ""misunderstanding""?)2. The power button is shifted left-right to turn on and off, but the button itself is very thin,  and without fingernail it's difficult to change the switch position. It's annoying. I would prefer a touch-style.3. There is no clip to adjust it on your car visor. I believe, this device was designed more for playing music as an external speaker for bluetooth enabled devices. The audio input confirm this. I am not sure I will be using at all.Overall, I like the speakerphone as it does a job. In fact, I have ordered one more for my daughter.

The ones we received do charge the Droid fine, though at about half the rate of the OEM wall charger that Motorola included with the Droid.  Going from 25% to 100% takes about 4 hours, versus about 2 with the OEM charger.A couple things struck me about the charger compared to the OEM model.  The cable is very thin, though longer, which is nice for out of reach plugs.  The build quality is mediocore, and definitely below that of the OEM charger.My conclusion is the chargers work and are a good value compared with buying from the Verizon store.  If you are looking for a quicker charge, it probably is worth getting the OEM model that came with your Droid.  But for a backup charger it's hard to beat the value on this offering.One other suggestion.

The reason that I stick with Motorola is that they have been very dependable for me. These headphones are not up to par.I could easily snap these in half by stepping on them or if one of the kids were to get ahold of them, they'd be goners for sure. I would feel unsafe wearing these outside, around the pool, or even just in my car traveling with them to hotels and such. I will only use these at home due to the poor build.Step it up, Motorola. It is a common assumption that a full bluetooth headset should sound better than a one piece bluetooth. However, my Motorola Finiti has better sound quality than these. I would recommend looking elsewhere or try out the Motorola Finiti. Great sound quality for music and puts this product to shame.

B002BH3I9U,A32O98PFC3OP7K,A Gamer at Heart,"[0, 0]","I was looking for a wireless solution to listen to music at the gym with my Itouch because I grew weary of earbud wires getting tangled up.  Based on the reviews here, the S305's seemed like an economical solution to try.The headphones charge very quickly, in about two hours or so.  Pairing on my Itouch was very simple.  I simply turned on Bluetooth, searched for devices, and was easily paired with the heaphones.The sound quality is certainly decent.  I am not an audiophile, I am just looking for basic listening quality to get me through my workout.  The bass response of these headphones are pretty decent, and overall I think the music quality is higher than what I was getting with my Creative earbuds.  The headphones turn off and on via a small power switch on the right cup, and there are two volume controls, up and down.  The buttons are pretty small, so I use the Itouch to control volume.I didn't find these headphones as flimsy as some of the reviews here indicate.  They are light and flexible, and I wouldn't really want them any heavier than they are now because they wouldn't be comfortable.The only issue I have is the fact that it is difficult to know when they are powered on and off.  It is not a big deal, and something I am still getting used to, but the headset would benefit from a clear power on and power off light.  It's possible that it's there and I am missing it, but if so it's not very visible.With these headphones selling in the low thirty dollar range as of this writing, I can't find much to complain about.  They sound good, seem to be well built, and offer a decent wireless solution.  The range is also pretty good - I accidently forgot my Itouch on a machine at the gym and wandered a good 30 feet before realizing I had left it behind because the music was still playing.  I also like these around the house to also listen to music.  You can't underestimate how much more convenient it is to listen to music without annoying wires.In the end, these are a decent solution and I am pleased with the quality and the price I paid for them.",4.0,1291248000,"12 2, 2010",Motorola S305 Bluetooth Stereo Headset w/ Microphone (Black) - Retail Packaging,37.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ddVQeCpOL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 958},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

B002BH3I9U,AKOMCT01A2S0I,Amazon Addict,"[0, 0]","I got this headset to use primarily for walking and moderate workouts. I was a little skeptical to go with an over the ear style after being used to ear buds. I didn't think the sound would compare. I am very happy with the sound from this headset. Sound level is plenty loud. Good range of highs/lows. Bass quality will vary for me somewhat but that really is attributed to the original quality of the MP3 and not the headset. It never sounds bad, some songs just sound better.I paired this set with my Motorola Electrify. This would be a Motorola Photon to any of you Sprint customers out there. Pairing was simple. As long as I have Bluetooth turned on with my phone, the set connects automatically when turned on. My phone is compatible with the advanced track, pause, play features. This is AWESOME. I agree sometimes the volume button can be hard to figure out up or down by feel but you can tell by the pitch of the beeps which way you are going. If you are headed the wrong direction it's pretty easy to correct.For me, my right front pant pocket seems to be the best place for my phone. I experience the least amount of cut out here.  This seems to get worse if I turn my head one direction more then the other. Now depending on the material of my pants I may not have any cut out at all. Also if I simply hold the phone in my hand I don't have any cut out. Some may not mind that but I like hands free. Not sure if this is from my phone or the receiver on the set. I have my phone paired with my sound bar and I can venture around my house pretty well without cut out. But in the headsets defense I usually do not have the phone in a pocket here.I was not expecting very good call quality so when I ordered this it was strictly for music. To my surprise it has great call quality. I think the mic is pretty sensitive so I would agree in a loud scenario it won't filter out much. In a normal setting no one can tell I'm using a Bluetooth device. I was very impressed with this. The headset makes noise when you have an incoming call so you can hear that if it's on. What I like is my phone still rings like normal so I can just throw the headset on when I want it and don't have to worry about missing a call.So here are the things I don't like that holds this at 4 stars for me.-While this headset is very light, I would not wear this thing for an extended period of time, such as all day at work. My ears get sore if I wear this thing for hours at a time. I'm good for a couple hours at most. Maybe that's just me. I don't like wearing the simple over the ear hook style Bluetooth ear pieces in general for this reason. So it's not just this device.-If you are going to be doing a lot of laying down or resting your head back, this style of headset is going to make that more challenging. You can re-position the headset to overcome this but it takes a bit of adjusting.-Ear pads will probably become pretty gross over time. I've been using this thing for about a month now and it's had some pretty good sweaty workouts to deal with. The pads are still in great shape, not discolored and have no foul smell about them but I'm sure overtime this will change. They may be challenging to clean after extended use.Overall I am very happy with this headset. I love the ability to be hands-free and wireless. If this set is not your cup of tea I would recommend the LG ear bud style with the neck piece. That was my next purchase if I didn't like this unit. This one was a bit cheaper and the LG unit has wires running from the neck piece to the ears with the buds. Again I wanted wirless and and didn't want to deal with buds falling out. If you are an all day wearer though, I would take a look at that set over this one.",4.0,1341446400,"07 5, 2012",Motorola S305 Bluetooth Stereo Headset w/ Microphone (Black) - Retail Packaging,37.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ddVQeCpOL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 958},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

B002BH3I9U,A1X1KNGE1QRPP1,"Amazon Customer ""Fisher""","[1, 1]","I wanted to give this product 5 stars because even though there are a couple of respectable drawbacks I still use them a lot. 3.5 stars would be more accurate, I think...I listen to a lot of music and I listen to it most of the day while at work.  My tastes are mixed.  Everything from Motzart to Steve Roach (ambient) to Rush (progressive rock) to pop (tons of 80's 90's).  I wanted wireless music from my DroidX2 phone which is what I use.The Good:  The electronics work well.  Pretty darn good sound quality but I have a pair of $10 ear buds that have a better bass sound than these.  Even so, the sound quality is easily acceptable unless you are really into hearing the slightest instrumental nuances in your music.  I'm very happy with the sound.The ability to use this product for a phone headset is fantastic.  I mean it's really good.  Incoming voice is very clear and I have yet to hear a complaint about my transmitions.  I really like that the caller's voice is in both of my ears.  Absolutely no compaints as it does exactly what it is supposed to do.Works great with my laptop after using a Medialink - USB Bluetooth Adapter which fits right into my laptop's USB port.The bad:  The erganomics of these headphones are not as good as they should be.  It will hurt my head after while.  I can only assume that a smaller head would have less trouble.  I wear a 7 1/2 hat size which puts me at a med/small and I will get sore ears and/or a headache after wearing these for an hour or more.Having said that, it isn't so uncomfortable that I have to take them off until I've been at it for 3 or 4 hours.  I listen to them at work so that amount of time isn't always enough.  Of course ideally they wouldn't give me a headache at all.  ;-)The controls aren't so easy to use.  The raised + / - signs that indicate the up and down volumn buttons aren't very helpful.  I have just gotten used to 'knowing' where to press for volumn control.  The Skip Forward and Backward in playlist bottons don't seem to work with PowerAMP which is a very popular app I use on my Droid.Finally, the plastic loop that runs behind your neck and connects the two speakers WILL WARP IF LEFT IN THE SUN AND WILL NOT BEND BACK.  I left mine in the car for about an hour and the loop is now a bit more curved on one side than it should be making the headphones a tad less comfortable to wear.  I should have known but just didn't think about it.In conclusion I would recommend these headphones because they do what is advertised and aren't too uncomfortable to wear for my head size so long as it's not for more than 3 hours or so at a time.

B002BH3I9U,AVXMSC307NSL4,Andrew Koester,"[1, 1]","It seems that most Bluetooth headphones seem to suffer from the same problems, mainly signal strength and sound quality. I've purchased a no-name pair of bluetooth headphones before, and while I found the sound was alright, they were generally uncomfortable and just barely worked. So recently when I came across the Motorla S305 Bluetooth Stereo Headset on sale, I thought about Bluetooth support along with my new laptop and cell phone, both supporting A2DP (stereo audio) and AVRCP (remote control) and decided to go for it. I was rather pleased to find it had remote control support, as well as a MicroUSB charger - the same as my Motorola Droid.

I still use them often every time I work out.  These are over the ear which she enjoys more.  The connection is very simple via bluetooth.  We had it connected to her iphone in a couple of minutes.  The music is pretty clear and can get decently loud (I listen to music pretty loudly).  The unit also can take and make calls.  When you press the phone button (assuming you have an iPhone with Siri) the siri bar comes up and you can make a call or do whatever you want via siri.  You can change tracks and increase/decrease volume via the side buttons as well.  It comes with a micro-usb charger to charge the unit.  I haven't used this pair much myself but the part that goes around your ears is similar to the S9's which I think is very comfortable.  The charge on these seem to last quite a while also but I am sure it will degrade since my older S9's usually need to be recharged after about an hour of use.,4.0,1365638400,"04 11, 2013",Motorola S305 Bluetooth Stereo Headset w/ Microphone (Black) - Retail Packaging,37.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ddVQeCpOL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 958},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

B002BH3I9U,A33O4IY2RLZP3J,Bel and Mike,"[5, 5]","I owned a Motorola S9 headset for almost three years. Excessive sweat from workouts finally completely fried the volume controls on the S9.I spent a little bit of time researching ""bluetooth stereo headsets"" with the following criteria in mind:1) it had to hold up against excessive sweating since it will be used mainly for exercising which primarily includes running, weight lifting and calisthenics. It also needs to stay on my head comfortably without falling off.2) it has to be wireless (Bluetooth), easy to operate, and work with my smartphone. I have an HTC Thunderbolt which is an Android phone.3) it has to be able to work primarily as a stereo headset. I don't really expect to take/place phone calls while working out, but it should be able to do that with ease as well.4) it has to be economical ($50 max spend especially if sweat breaks the product down)5) it has to have overwhelmingly good reviews from others who purchased the productI looked over a lot of products, both higher end and lower end. I read countless reviews that people left on different products and seller feedback as well. Although I enjoyed my Motorola S9, I was not inclined completely on buying another product from Motorola. But after a time-consuming review, I settled on this product which was $32 with free shipping for Prime customers.  After receiving the product, which came quickly, I evaluated the product and have the following comments:1) the product came with a mini USB which is the same power cord that my smartphone and other Bluetooth hands-free set for the car uses. (BONUS! An extra charger and my existing chargers will work on this same headset.)2) the headset charged up within an hour - to my amazement. it was very easy to connect to my smartphone, too, coming with simple instructions to understand.3) sound quality is excellent. one comment - if you are listening to music loudly, others will be able to hear what you are listening to - in case you get embarrassed listening to Rihanna while you are working out!4) control buttons are a little smaller to use, but I rate them as good nevertheless because they had no problem responding and controlling the songs or calls on the smartphone.5) volume control button falls in line with the above, but one thing I liked about it was that when you get to the loudest level, and keep pressing the volume button, it doesn't reset to the lowest volume level like my S9 did. Also, volume can be further controlled using your smartphone.6) placing/receiving calls was easy. the sound quality was very good, including what my callers said - that they were surprised I was using a headset which sounded like a regular phone conversation. I think the mic is on the earpiece, there is a little hole at the bottom of one earpiece, so it must be a sensitive mic. After hanging up, the music continued playing right where it left off, no problems there.7) finally, the headset itself is a lot more flexible than the S9. It feels more comfortable than the S9, even though it goes around the back of your head in the same manner. It has the ear wrap-arounds which make it feel snug and comfortable on your head as well. The even fit comfortably on my 4 year old daughter who picked them up and starting running around the house with them on her head!I recommend these headphones because it satisfied all of my criteria, and it appears to be a great value for the money. If you expect to sweat your brains out while working out, and want a pair of headphones that won't break down, then this is the right set to buy. The lower cost and greater comfort/flexibility than the S9 or S10 makes it another compelling reason to buy.",5.0,1313020800,"08 11, 2011",Motorola S305 Bluetooth Stereo Headset w/ Microphone (Black) - Retail Packaging,37.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ddVQeCpOL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 958},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

Simple activate bluetooth on my phone, turn on the headphones, and hit play on the headphones and I'm off.  My completely enjoyment ends, however, when the headphones ""connect"" but nothing on them works, in this case I have to reset my bluetooth connection between the two devices by unpairing and repairing the connection.  Unfortunately this happens about every 5th time I use them.  On top of that the sound quality is certainly not magnificent with little to zero bass and should you have your phone/music player in the opposite pocket to the headphone's receiver, in which case you will enjoy the frequent dead pockets in the music where the connection fails.  30ft? I don't think so.  I believe this is caused by the movement of my pocket, however, because I can set my phone on my desk and walk across the room and into the hallway without being interrupted.  The good news is, however, that they are PERFECT for biking where you don't want a cord in the way, they're also superb for making calls as they have a push-to-talk feature built in which works rather well.  On top of that call quality is rather good, in the past using bluetooth headphones I was frequently asked if I was on speakerphone and told that it sounded like I was breaking up, however with these headphones I had essentially zero problems with hearing the person and zero problems with them hearing me.  Oh yea, and the battery life is no where NEAR advertized.  It's like 3 hours of constant use (highish volume though)Summary:  Good headphones that are not without their problems.

B002BH3I9U,AJO2V8O9EU056,Dan,"[0, 0]",I've used several brands of Stereo Bluetooth headsets from Jabra to Plantronics to Motorola. I was mostly obsessed with getting ear bud style bluetooth headsets and did not want to give the over the ear ones a try. I thought they would get more sweaty at the gym or cause me to feel uncomfortable with the bulk but I was wrong!  These light weight S305's are fantastic.  The sound is about as good as bluetooth headsets can get. I do 45 minutes to an hour of weight training and 30-40 minutes of cardio in these and I often forget I'm wearing them.With my old ear bud style ones I would constantly have to re-adjust them during my workout. I would have a hard time skipping tracks and adjusting volume because the the buttons were so small and hard to use. With these S305's the button placement is excellent and easy to use and the only time I have to adjust them is when I do incline bench press but even that got easier to deal with after a few workouts.I have taken a few phone calls with these and those sound great too. The other party can hear me clearly and I can hear them clearly. I will say that if you are outside taking a phone call and there is a some wind the other party will hear the wind noise and it can become annoying on longer calls.  This is a minor complaint since I mostly use these for music and if I take a call with them I'm usually at home not outside.Overall I highly recommend these Motorola S305's. The price is excellent at $30-35 and they seem durable. I've been using them for over a month now and I will not go back to earbud style headphones again.QUICK TIP: If you sweat in them DO NOT charge them right away. When you get home let them sit for several hours (or overnight) before you charge them. Charging them after you sweat in them is a great way to fry the battery and burn them out.  The battery life is excellent and you should be able to get at least 3-4 workouts with them before they need charging.Edit: Well after 3.5 months the unit broke. The volume button stopped working on them. Too late to return them to Amazon but Motorola is going to replace them. I just have to pay to ship it back to them.  If the replacement breaks I will probably look to buy the Kinivo BTH220.  They seem sturdier than these Motorola's. I am a little disappointed that these don't cut out any outside noise at all (like zero noise cancelling). The foam pads barely touch my ears so I can hear all outside noise. The guy next to me was stomping as he ran on the treadmill and I could barely hear my own music.,2.0,1355270400,"12 12, 2012",Motorola S305 Bluetooth Stereo Headset w/ Microphone (Black) - Retail Packaging,37.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ddVQeCpOL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 958},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"
B002BH3I9U,A2JWRI3B90ZL82,Darth Shatner,"[0, 0]","After trying out about four different sets of earbuds (which either hurt my ears, made my ears ring or sounded tinny and cheap), I took a shot at these, figuring the sound couldn't be any worse, and the discomfort certainly couldn't.  If I were to like them, the wireless feature would be a bonus.  Having said all that, though, I was highly skeptical.  I expected weak sound, spotty bluetooth and about an hour of battery life, tops.  In fact, I kept all the original packaging pristine to prepare for their return.  I'm happy too say I was proven wrong on all counts.  They're quite lightweight and comfortable, for starters (though if you're wearing a hoodie or something high up on the back of your neck, they can be a bit clunky -- admittedly, this is nitpicking);  Stunningly, the sound is crisp with full bass that put every earbud I tried to shame;  battery life is a non-issue, as they last for hours on a single charge; and, most amazingly, the bluetooth feature is smooth as silk.  The only time I could get it to skip was when I was across my house with the phones from the actual music player -- and then it was still mostly uninterrupted.  While I obviously can't guarantee you'll have the exact same result and response, I can highly recommend these phones -- I've been really surprised and delighted -- and the ability to answer phone calls has been effortless (I use a Droid X) and something I hadn't even thought of.  I will say that the controls on the earphone are a bit tricky to master without looking at when you use them -- but I had 'em down after a few days' use.

B002BH3I9U,A1MFEDL2I4ZAIT,Eric L.,"[0, 0]","The only reason these headphones didn't get five stars is  because of the relatively cheap build quality, this comes with the price point but doesn't interfere with the integrity of the product. The headphones sit comfortable over the ear and with a little bit of manuvering, will fit on your ears with glasses. All the weight is carried on the ears which makes it so  these headphones don't bounce up and down (a characteristic oif many behind the neck headphones). The functionality of the controls are great though a direct push on the icons is needed to have the function correctly registered. The pairing process is effortless and the 'phones will last about 6 workouts before having to be recharged. The recharging takes about  45 minutes and the 'phones will probably last longer if you don't have the internal volume cranked up as I  do. Though i do this so I can simply control the volume from my iPhone. The sound quality was surprisinglky good, with many instruments coming through that I usually don't hear with inexpensive headphones. If you like bass in your music  these headphones will not dissapoint as the 30mm drivers provide nice bass.

They are, unfortunately poor on two key counts if you're interested in using them to listen to music.  The first is that the bluetooth feature for listening to music just didn't work well and was easily disrupted, either by moving around in relation to the source of the bluetooth broadcast or, when using my iPad or iPhone, if I were using any other apps on the device.The comfort of these headphones was also poor and the behind the neck placement irritating if I were sitting.  The headphones pinched too tightly on my head and the grip or tension was not adjustable.  After a relatively short time, the pressure on my ears was unacceptably painful.  The behind the head placement of the loop connecting the individual earpieces is nominally a good idea, but because the loop of the headset is fairly large, it sticks out behind and down the neck.

After a couple weeks with it and using it mainly to pair with my Motoactv on workouts I can say that they are just OK. The sound quality is very good, the ease of use is high, and they feel very comfortable. The biggest issue I'm encountering is while I'm out on runs the audio will skip or cut out for seconds at a time and then come back. This happening once or twice an hour would be fine, but this is happening once or twice per song which is unacceptable. If I had to guess I'd say that the erratic playback is due to sweat causing problems with the headset since there is minimal to no issues when they're dry. The Motoactv shows no signs of issue with a wired headset during these times too, so I don't think that's the problem. I'll give them another week before saying goodbye and trying a different product. It's a shame too, these guys are solid otherwise.UPDATE: 12/27/2012: Returned these and went with the Moto S11's and won't be looking back. They are far superior for workouts than these headphones.

B002BH3I9U,A11Q8GL9FW7IGK,Josh Winters,"[0, 0]","I had always wanted a pair of bluetooth headphones, but could never get myself to spend the money on them myself. I received a different pair as a gift for Christmas and loved how they could be applied to my daily life, but they were an in-ear variety that had poor sound quality and was simply uncomfortable to wear.So, i returned them & began shopping around for a decent mid-range over-ear set when I found these. The reviews were glaringly positive & I see why.Sound Quality--I'm a musician, so I have fairly well trained ears. I certainly didn't expect studio quality sound from a $40ish pair of bluetooth headphones. However, the performance and sonic quality of this item greatly exceeded any of my expectations. They sound fantastic and are perfectly acceptable for any casual listener.Microphone Recording Quality--I use Siri quite a bit on my phone & haven't had any problems related to poorly received voice commands. In voice calls the worst people have said is &#34;You sound a little different, but you sound fine.&#34; Again, perfectly acceptable for my standards.Weight--Very light weight. Zero complaints.The Fit--This is wildly different on an individual basis, so I can only relate my experience. I have a bit of a large head and wear glasses. Naturally the concern for anyone with glasses is feeling like you have a pile of stuff pulling down on your ears. These absolutely DO NOT interfere with my glasses. However, I have rather thin framed specs so it allows for plenty of extra room on my ear. That being said, even with thick emo style frames I think these would continue to work without bothering you. I even wear them with glasses while jogging on the treadmill without problems.Cell Phone Integration-- I absolutely love how well this headset works with my phones. I actually use an iPhone 5, but also have an older Evo 4G on hand. It works extremely well with both phones. It syncs quickly and easily, and the right-earphone has 4 well-disguised buttons for call/accept call, skip forward, skip back, and play/pause. All functions worked perfectly on both android and apple platforms. As a pleasant surprise I tapped the call button on my iphone while it was in a standby state. I was delighted to hear the little Siri sound blip in my ear & mic channel open to accept a voice command.Battery Life-- I've used this headset for roughly a half hour a day for a week & still going strong. It advertises 4-6 hours of use & I am inclined to believe it. It seems perfectly acceptable given the fact that this lightweight set of headphones cannot have a large battery in them weighing them down.Range-- Once again I was blown away by the performance. Last night I let my daughter play on my phone upstairs while I played with these downstairs. When I powered them on I was shocked when they connected to my phone 20 yards away through an entire floor's layer of construction. I can basically leave my phone anywhere in my house and simply keep my headset on. VERY nice for those times when you forget to stuff your phone in your pocket before walking away.Final Impressions-- I think what will make or break the use of this product for someone is simply the question of &#34;Does it fit your head?&#34; Beyond that, there's really nothing more you could possibly ask for given the dollars you'd be spending. I am sure there's a pair out there with slightly better sound or an extra button or two, but for the money you simply can't beat these.",5.0,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",Motorola S305 Bluetooth Stereo Headset w/ Microphone (Black) - Retail Packaging,37.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ddVQeCpOL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 958},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

These headphones have become my daily drivers & I do mean DAILY! I rock them from sun up to sun down because the BATTERY LIFE & STANDBY TIME is SUPER! The sound quality is super for a non in ear, non noise cancellation option! I listen to a tone of music and have tested a tone of headphone options. WHY DO THESE SOUND BETTER THAN ALL THE IN EAR OPTIONS I'VE TRIED!? What takes the cake is that they have great sound, but they don't cancel out the noise around you so if you like to ride your bike in the city like me, you can mind your surroundings. The Bluetooth radius is true to specifications as long as you don't have a major object blocking the connection like multiple walls. The microphone is excellent at picking up your voice for hands-free calling and voice to text which also works better than most! As for what I bought them for, LOL they work flawlessly at the gym. Running, lifting, riding, basketball you name it, they are right there with you! There is a slight discomfort after about 45 minutes, but I have found that after about a month you get used to it or in my case it seems like it has adjusted to my head so I don't feel it. *Kanye Shrug* I wear them all day because when not in use I just lay them around my neck.

B002BH3I9U,A1MFVAHTT2BHM0,J. Wang,"[0, 0]","I made the mistake of upgrading from these headphones to LG's headphones. By far, these headphones are better due to their over-the-ear design, allowing the headphones to sit comfortably on the user's ears, and not block out external noises. This means you can exercise outside while wearing them and not be in danger of not hearing your surroundings. Also, you don't have any loose bits flying around, or thin wire and a lousy storage system for the earbuds, which is just annoying.The S305 offers beautiful sound for being an earlier bluetooth headset, and is basically a wireless upgrade from its more popular wired cousin, which I also believe is one of the best budget wired headsets one can buy for their money.The buttons are clear and intuitive, after a short while one can learn to control their devices with very little thought, though of course communicating with the device in my experience, has been a bit of a headache. Yet the S305 has managed to do this moreso reliably than compared with the LG. My device can at least be in my pocket while I am walking, and I will be able to play music with little to no interruptions.If you are torn between the S305 and LG's sad attempt at making a headset, definitely do go for the S305.

As you can see from the tons of positive reviews, these are clearly the best on the market for the price range. I'd say they are probably worth far more than the listed price.Pro's:Very simple set up & operation. Just follow the docs.Sound quality is very good for BT wireless headphones.Very few (if any) drop outs. I walk the dog all day and they never skip or pause.Works great with Apple products (you knew know right?).Battery life seems great - I have used them for several hours on end for music and never ran into low battery warnings. They recharge fast.Hands down the BEST wireless BT headphones I have tried. I list the con's only out of full disclosure. None are a show stopper.Con's: (really pretty minor ones actually)Volume and operations buttons feel loose and flimsy. It would be nice to have more solid buttons as you will press them to often. Button placement takes a little getting used to.The max volume is a little low. This is probably to save battery life. While driving on the highway (or somewhere there is a lot of external noise) I have to turn them all the way up and even so it could be louder. For instance, trying to listen to classical music with soft passages or an audiobook is ""iffy"" on these if you have a lot of external noise.Lots of sound bleed - my wife tells me she can hear the music quite clearly even when I have them at half volume. I think this is a double edge thing - on the plus side the ""open-ness"" lets me hear sounds in the environment very clearly. The down side is everyone can hear the music and of course you aren't ever going to get ""isolation"" with these if that's what you are looking for.Lastly, they tend to hurt my ears after a few hours of wearing them.

B002BH3I9U,A3JUQ2E799OC5B,"Markcm ""Markcm""","[0, 0]","I initially set out searching amazon specifically for Bluetooth sport headphones with a mic for use jogging with my Blackberry curve 8900. My first impression was that there did not seem to be the best selection of models to choose from, I had it in my mind what I wanted but had never used any similar products. I had previously used a set of wired sport headphones and the wire was an absolute pain while jogging! Competing models seemed to be more expensive than these, ranging up around $75 and the reviews weren't all that satisfying.When I saw these Motorola S305, the form was exactly what I had in mind and the price ($33 shipped) seemed fantastic to me. I liked the fact that there were so many positive reviews as well. I purchased them from Amazon and received them with in 2-3 days with free super saver shipping; I live in Washington state...Durability: I had a little concern ordering these based on a review that stated the build quality was a bit weak; I don't find that to be the case at all; these appear to be very well designed and built.  I had also read that some other brands had issues with sweat and rain which made some concern; I am not ""heavy sweater"" but I defiantly do a fair share of perspiring when exercising and I have also worn these in the rain, they have not missed a beat.Battery Life: I charged these up which I think took about 2-3 hours for the first full charge. I used these for almost a week at 30-40 minutes per use on a single charge, I'd estimate that I got about 4 hours of continuous music play which I think is amazing considering the battery must be tiny because these are so light weight. They started beeping when the battery went low and I was just about to run so I put them on the charger for about 10 minutes which was enough juice to keep them going for the next 40 minutes without beeping at me (very pleased!). They seem to be smart in that they shut off if no connection is present, I like that feature.Sound quality: My main use for these is listening to music while exercising. I am a huge music enthusiast but I am not super picky about sound coloration and such. I specifically wanted an over-ear phone, not an in-ear bud, so that I could still hear my surrounding environment. Sure in-ear buds have impressive bass response but I also have found that the cords tend to pick up and transmit a lot of noise which is very annoying to me. I would imagine that a set of Bose would out-perform these but honestly, as I mentioned I am very in to music and these sound great. I don't crank them too high so I'm not sure if they would distort but for normal listening, I couldn't be happier.Bluetooth connectivity: As mentioned, I use these with my blackberry curve 8900; they were very simple to do the initial set up and the pair/ un-pair without issue every time.Control Features: When previously using my wired headphones connected to my blackberry which I had in an arm band, it was very difficult to control the music player. For example, when a song comes on that I don't like it really messes up my running rhythm and I want to fast forward but it was difficult with the blackberry in the armband. The controls on the headphones were one of the main features that attracted me and they are VERY EASY TO OPERATE; I couldn't be happier. The buttons are spaced out enough to easily control the function you intended and there is a nice audible feedback beep when you adjust the volume (different for up/down).Phone: I mainly wanted these for wireless music while jogging but the ability to answer the phone was a bonus as well. The control button on the headphone is very easy to use and supports voice dialing or last number redial. Operation is fantastic and the microphone seems to work well. I tested by speaking softly and a little less clearly than normal and the other party had no issue hearing me at all. On the other hand, the received voice signal from the other party oddly enough is not very clear; it is defiantly usable but I am surprised in the low quality of the signal.Comfort: For about the first 3 days of use, I felt a little pressure on the back of my right ear where the rigid band rests, I would say it was slightly discomforting but I dealt with it. By about the 4 time using these, my ear had gotten used to it and the discomfort had gone away. These are very light and now that the initial discomfort has gone away I almost can't even tell these are on my head.Potential concern: I haven't checked availability but I would assume at some point the foam pads will need to be replaced and I'm not sure if they are replaceable. I'm not going to discount these headphones yet based in this as I haven't checked in to it but it is a consideration.Packaging: This is the only item that I give a huge FAIL. These were in the most user un-friendly packaging I've seen in a long time. The display plastic packaging was molded close to the item and the seam seal around the edge was very strong making for a work-out just getting them out of the packaging... Come on Motorola, get with the game on this one.Summary: I am so excited about these headphones, they meet my needs and expectations at a great price. I was so pleased that I just purchased another pair for my wife.",5.0,1305590400,"05 17, 2011",Motorola S305 Bluetooth Stereo Headset w/ Microphone (Black) - Retail Packaging,37.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ddVQeCpOL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 958},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

My test-bed was an iPhone 3Gs.The first pair I tried was the S9-HD's. These sounded pretty good and the fit was nice.The second pair I tried were the Senns and wow. These were pretty impressive. I thought there was no way a pair of bluetooth 'phones could compete with wireds, but alas, I was wrong. While not acoustically perfect (slightly anemic bass), these sound amazing.This brings me to the S305's. These look nicer than the Senns, but that's where the overtaking positives end. The sound is quite flat with a slight tinnyness to it, and has very little bass. The bass gets a little better if you press the phones against your ear, but who wants to do that? I tried every single eq setting and none made a difference. That being said, the iPhone is noted for having a relatively flat response, but the Senns offer decent bass response. Heck, even the S9-HDs have a relatively good low end. So there's no reason this particular set doesn't. And I'm not talking bass-head low end. I'm talking enough to provide a balance fill. The second issue I take with these, is they aren't particularly comfortable and make my ears sore after just a few minutes of use.Don't get me wrong, these aren't terrible.

However, these are my points of assessment:Comfort: I don't know what most people consider to be ""comfortable"", but this set does not fit for me. It feels awkward, with its ark at the rear of my head, and it does not hug my ears snugly enough. When I lean back against my high sofa seat or pillows, the beam behind my head gets in the way and pushes the set off my ears, since it is not precisely snug around the rear of my head.I also wear reading glasses, and the bow of the set gets into a room crisis/conflict with the branches of my glasses right behind and above my ears. There is room for one of those, but not for the both.I wanted to use it for two things: as my speaker system for the laptop and at the same time, to use as the blue-tooth for my iPhone-4. The sound quality for music and sound files played from my laptop is poor, compared to the Plantronics DSP 400 I have been using until now. For my iPhone, I tried to pair it 3 times. I turned it off, then on again, to be discovered. It signaled that it was paired for phone calls, but upon testing it by calling my husband's iPhone-4, I never got to hear anything in the headset. I had to turn to the phone's speaker system instead.

For work I have been using Koss's Porta-Pro folding headphone and can easily recommend them for the cost.  I consider the PortaPro the best headphones for under $50.  I am most certainly NOT an audiophile as any true audiophile would scoff at the cans I use.  However, I do not like so-so audio quality either.The Motorola S305 Bluetooth Stereo Headphones were bought hoping I could use them to listen to music from various sources I have at the office.  And they fill that bill.  I also wanted a decent set of cans.  Nothing great, just good enough to keep me un-annoyed.  And they seem to do that although getting them to work cleanly with Amarok on my Fedora 16 desktop took some fiddling.  They now work and sound as good with my Linux box as with any other box or OS.The S305s work with my Droid Bionic (Android 2.3.4), my Samsung RF511 (Windows7), my Dell 6410(WindowsXP.Pro), and my Dell desktop (Fedora16).  It syncs and holds sync well with all of them.  The cans are a little dull and bassy sounding.  Not horribly so, well OK horribly so when compared to my ER-4's; but otherwise OK compared to my Koss Porta-Pros.  Their quality, however, is not as good as the Porta-Pros.  For that sort of quality in Bluetooth headphones I suspect one will have to spend $100 or more.Sounds like I might not like them.  That's the wrong idea.  They are OK for the price.  I have walked 60+ feet away from my desk in a cubicle office environment with a high concentration of electronics and they still work.  They connect to Asus BT21 Bluetooth dongles or my Bionic.  60 feet isn't shabby at all.They are generally comfortable.  If you wear glasses with thick ear pieces and don't have a fat-head (like I do) you will get along with the S305s.  Fortunately I have thin ear pieces with my glasses and can adjust the phones to be comfortable enough.My only wish is that I had experience with other Bluetooth headphones so I could judge these better.

This headset easily connects to my iPhone and my computer for wireless music and telephone calls. I was hesitant to buy a headset that didn't have a separate extended microphone piece but nobody has ever even asked me if I'm on a headset or not because they can hear me just fine. Having the ability to turn the speakers up so loud during phone calls is priceless, too. I mostly bought these so that I could talk hands free in the car and have a stereo headphone set for other times. This accomplishes both beautifully and people can hear me just fine.Also, I have an older 2G iPhone. By default the, headset works fine with this phone as a phone only, not as a stereo headset. I was able to download the A2DP app (Google it) and could then listen to my music from my older iPhone. It works beautifully. If you find yourself needing to do this, keep in mind two things: 1) The iPhone must be jailbroken to get this app. If you have a 3G or later, you don't need it - these will work perfectly with no modifications. 2) You have to start your music on the phone then press the play button on the headset in order for it to recognize it as a music player.The battery life is great on these headphones - it seems to last as long as I want. I did run out of battery once but it was one of the first times using it when the battery hadn't ever been fully charged.My only dislike on this is that after a while the headset can get uncomfortable and it's not a perfect combination with sunglasses because it uses the top of your ears to hold the weight, as do the sunglasses.

I have several sets of earphones but they are either bulky or requires to hook up a power adapter and audio cables.My current favorite before this purchase is an IR line of sight Sony.  It uses one ""AA"" battery which lasts for a very long time.  Another bonus is that the transmitter that you plug to the audio source also works as battery charger.  I also have a 900 Mhz Senheiser.  A lot of reviewers seem to like this but I found it too heavy and bulky.  The interference is too much for me that I hardly use it anymore.Anyway, I mentioned an IR, a 900 Mhz, but this time it is a bluetooth headphone.  They all work in differently.  The bluetooth will only work if you have a bluetooth device.  For my purpose, this is excellent as you don't have any power adapter and audio cables to attach.  The 30-35 ft in the spec is accurate.  I did wander beyond 50 ft but the connection starts to fail at that point.  And when I turned across the corner, the music signal finally stopped.It has the power button, forward, volume control (- and +) located on the right ear.I also tried it on my iPhone and it works fine.  The music will stop when you get a call and just a push of a button to accept.  After hanging-up, your music continues where you left off.It also works great with my iPhone while exercising on the elliptical machine.  Now I don't have to strap my player and worry about hacking the earphone cord with a wayward motion of my arms.Cons:- I really like to have an option of a replaceable battery.  If this goes dead in the middle of whatever I am listening to, there is no choice but to plug it via USB and wait a few hours before I can use it again.  A  triple ""A"" battery would be nice.- It is hard to tell if it is on because the LED light  is hardly visible.

It paired very easily with Windows Mobile and Android Phones (Samsung, Motorola, HTC); as well as my B/T equipped laptop (HP).Wearibility-wise, although it caused the some annoying discomfort in back of my right ear, it rested well over the ears. Perhaps a softer (rubberized?) padding around the plastic band would have helped.The audio/call control buttons are placed intuitively. I found the B/T range to be excellent. A very nice feature is that with my phone set to mute, I could receive the various audible notifications (email, text message, incoming phone call) on the headset.The sound quality is very good although not as good as in high-frequency range an ""in-ear"" set might provide but this IMHO is a trade-off (as most in-ear sets don't have very good low-frequency reproduction). The volume range is excellent which compensated very well for the muted highs.I have worn this headset while working-out and had no issues.

The freedom of Bluetooth makes my iPod more enjoyable to use with my music and other apps. I also purchased a Bluetooth dongle (Medialink - USB Bluetooth Adapter) for my netbook with the intention of using the headset.Each transmitting Bluetooth device needs to be paired correctly with the headset. Pairing was straightforward with both my iPod Touch and my netbook. Once paired, the headset worked well with both devices.Note that the Motorola S305 is a headset (as opposed to just headphones) as it includes a microphone. It works very well with Google Voice, Voice Memo, and Skype on my iPod. The sound is excellent and the microphone produces very clear sound.I've never used a behind-the-neck headset before and only had over-the-head headsets. It took a while getting used to but once I did, I found them just fine. They are not adjustable for size but they me fit well and the pressure on the ears is not too great. I find however, that after about a half-hour, I need to take them off.They have built-in ear cushions and I'm not sure how they will wear over time. They also seem a bit fragile and I'm not sure how they will hold up. The manufacturer says that if the frames become bent they can be straightened out by carefully bending them.

While the sound quality doesn't compare to myGrado iGrado Headphones, for bluetooth headphones at this price, it's good enough for casual listening and has exceeded my expectations.  The range is pretty poor and I've had a few instances of brief stuttering with my iPhone 4 in my jeans pocket (in its case); however, those intermittent issues are an acceptable trade-off for wireless convenience when working around the house or yard.  With the latest version of the iOS, all the playback controls  (play\pause, skip fwd & rev) on the headphones work. Call quality is very good and people have no idea I'm on a headset.Overall, these are fantastic for cycling as there are no wires to get in the way, at a reasonable volume the headphones allow in enough outside noise to hear traffic, and, with the phone in a jersey pocket or bike mount, the phones are close enough not to have any issues with range. On the bike, you will get a bit of wind noise. The neck band sits comfortably below a helmet so they are comfortable on long rides. For cycling these headphones are a great in combination withRAM Mounting Systems RAP-274-1-AP6U EZ ON/OFF Handlebar Mount for Apple iPhone 3G & 3GS.

I haven't had great experiences regarding sound quality on Bluetooth devices. This one is different. The sound embodies crisp highs and full lows. Some headsets are mid-range only, but I'm happy to report these rein in the full scope of sound.They seem to have one small drawback: the volume. It's too low. At their loudest, they're just below where I usually listen to music. Not good for lawn mowing or anyplace where there is ambient noise. I hear conversations from the patio next door when I have them on at full blast. One weird little quirk about that: I like them for bike riding.

It got down to 15 minutes, now no more.  Less than two years.Phone call quality is fair to poor.  Indoors in a quiet place call quality is good.  Fair means that people on the other end of the line might mention about the call quality and background noise.  Poor means people say they can't  understand the call.I'm not a great judge of sound quality, my hearing is not good, I do wear behind the ear hearing aids at times.  One thing I like is that this headset does fit with the hearing aids on or off.  And I also wear glasses.  The unit fits with or without any combination of glasses, hearing aids.  Music, speech and other audio sound very good with or without the hearing aids -- the unit sounds much better that sound from the various Thinkpad and Mac laptops I use.

Functionality with the nano and the adaptor was good, pause, fwd/rev, all controllable via the headphone buttons.

I settled on the S305s based on the price and other reviews. Here are my impressions so far:Pros:-Easily connects with my Galaxy Nexus and 2010 MacBook Pro and can have both connected simultaneously.-Decent sound quality (Mac owners search for Terminal command to improve bitrate.)-Reasonably small and light.-Micro USB charger.-Battery life is decent, I get between 7-8 hours on a charge.-Range seems decent but there are a lot of other variables (other device, wireless interference, walls, etc.)-I wear glasses and these do not interfere.-Works pretty well while running or cycling, not sure about sweat resistance though-Calls sound ok through the headphones, but callers reported that I sound better than usual when using the built-in mic.-Price seems reasonable for the performance.Neutral:-Volume controls don't seem all that easy to press, the other buttons are however-If you experience lag when watching video on your computer, consider using a program like VLC Player so you can control the audio delay to properly sync things up again. Not the headphones fault, but worth mentioning.Cons:-Neck loop is large for my head and just hangs in the back. This makes leaning your head against anything awkward.

I really enjoy listening to music on the go* Holds a good charge* Charger is standard 5V thin USB, so you can use your Android phone outlet or USB adapter to charge it from either an electrical outlet or a computer (supplied adapter is outlet only)* microphone quality is pretty good, as long as I'm in fairly quiet surroundings, people report hearing me well* I can drive or ride a bike with them as the external sounds are not completely blocked* No wires! earbuds cables which constantly got tangled used to drive me crazy. No more!* Low price - great value for the moneyCons:* No charge level indicator - I need to guess. Even three leds for &#62;80%, &#60;20% would have been great* Takes some practice to get them connected to my phone. Bluetooth connectivity has always been a black art. The best way for me is to turn off bluetooth on the phone, and then turn it back on as I turn on the device.* Sometimes cuts in and out. I assume this is due to interferences.

This is a bluetooth stereo headset, plain and simple. The music quality is amazing, it's SUPER easy to use, and all the buttons are in the right places. They are so intuitive that you actually don't even need to read the manual to know what each button does, it just feels natural. It's comfortable, I wear mine on average about 2 hrs a day and I often forget they are even on my head. I like wearing this to listen to podcasts and music while riding my bicycle. Often, someone will call my cell while I'm riding. I don't have to stop or get my phone out of my bag, I can just git the button and this headset will automatically stop my music and connect me with the call. Even more amazing, I can be riding at 15 mph and I can hear the caller perfectly, and she/he does not notice any windy noises. As soon as they hang up, I don't have to hit any buttons, the headset automatically start my music where it left off. I can also control my music with the headset (pause, next song, previous song, volume, etc...). The battery life is amazing. I've never had it die on me, so I'm actually not sure how long it lasts. I've used it for 2 hr long phone calls, and use it to listen to music on long runs/bike rides/while doing the dishes. I charge it about once to twice a week. It takes like 15 mins to charge too.

B002BH3I9U,A35WYJH6MPPIFV,turf,"[2, 3]","I really like these headphones. I am about to buy my fourth pair in two years. They have decent sound quality, plenty sufficient for my primary use of listening to audiobooks and podcasts, and talking on the phone. Since I am not an audiophile, they are okay for music but I prefer to use good headphones for ""real"" music. They have very good call quality. They are my go-to bluetooth headphones for most activities and very handy to be able to listen to music and be able to take or make calls.The downside is that the average life of them is six months before they start flaking out and they won't turn on any more. Usually before this happens the light won't go out on them even when they are turned off and they burn through the battery quickly. Yes, I am well aware of the battery reset process, which usually stops working after three or four months.But I can't be too hard on them since I wear them for exercise and outdoor activities and I sweat a lot, so the foam cushions get soaking wet. This is probably why they don't last too long for me since this likely affects the inner electronics and/or battery which is why they have such a short life for me. And it used to make me mad that they gave up the ghost so quickly. But, once the price dropped to around $30, I started considering them disposable and a 6 month lifespan was acceptable. I certainly would not pay more than $30 for them, though.These headphones also meet two other absolute requirements I have - they sit on top of the ears and don't completely cover it up, or stick in my ear like earbuds, which would lead to even more sweating - plus I get ear infections when using either one of these. And they charge with any micro-usb cable so can be used with any of the dozen chargers I have lying around at home or work. I really ought to give them five stars for just these features alone since there are very few other headphones that meet these two criteria, but with the short life span of them, I really can't.Edit, 6 months later: Here I am looking for another pair since the ones I have are about to go. But I won't buy them this time since the price has risen to $40, granted that's the price including shipping since I have Prime. But they don't last long enough to justify that cost. So I am off to buy the Inland equivalent of these, the ProHT, since they _are_ $30 at my local Microcenter. The buttons are not as convenient and it charges with a mini instead of the preferable micro usb, but I can't bring myself to spend $40 on disposable headphones.",3.0,1344038400,"08 4, 2012",Motorola S305 Bluetooth Stereo Headset w/ Microphone (Black) - Retail Packaging,37.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ddVQeCpOL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 958},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

B002BH3I9U,A29C6EN5ADR5PD,_Voltron_,"[0, 0]","CONS: These headphones HURT to wear. The reason being is there is no padding whatsoever on the part that actually rests on your ears. The best way I can describe it (which you cannot see in the picture) is imagine a long rectangular piece of plastic, now fold that in half so you now have a long u-shaped piece of plastic. Now form that piece into the curve shape you see in the picture. Now strap this around your ears with the weight of both sides (granted they are pretty lightweight) supported solely by the tops of your ears. Keep in mind, you have a two plastic edges sitting on top of each ear. After about 15 minutes of running I have to take them off. No amount of re-positioning helps. A better design would have made the headband part a solid cylinder so there are no edges, or placing a small section of padding on the part that actually rests on the ears.PROS: For the money, they sound like you would expect. I have no complaints in that department.

B002BH3I9U,AG9G4VUJB6709,waetherman,"[21, 23]","I was skeptical about Bluetooth headphones, and have stayed away from even trying them mostly because of the price. But the Motorola S305's cost half what other Bluetooth headphones have in the past so I decided to give them a try. Mostly I've been very impressed with these, though I do have a few problems.First, the sound quality is very good - on par with a decent set of wired headphones of similar price. I haven't found there to be any static, though occasionally (and inexplicably) the sound will cut out for a half second, which can be annoying. It doesn't happen that often though. The range on these is remarkably good - I bought these specifically for jogging, so the range would only ever have to be about 2 feet, but I've also used them at my desk and I really appreciate the freedom to get up and walk around up to 20 feet away with several walls between my phone and me. When the headphones do get out of range, they just disconnect, and then reconnect when they're in range again. The volume is also very good, and although they do not cover the ears completely, the volume can be turned up to the point where it covers most outside noise. If I were choosing headphones just for work or travel, I might choose something with greater noise isolation, but since I chose these for general use and especially exercise (where size and weight are the main consideration) these work nicely. The headphones are quite comfortable, more so than other behind-the-head earphones I've tried. Wearing them for a couple hours at a time did not cause any numbness or pain. They are also pretty secure, and jogging with them hasn't been a problem. I appreciate the fact that these charge with a micro-USB cable, which means that I can charge with my PC and a standard cable when I'm on the road. Sadly, the included charge is a hard-wired micro-usb type, unlike the ones that take a powerplug and provide standard USB-out, so if you don't want to bring the power charger with you you'll have to buy a micro-USB cable.My biggest problem with the headphones so far is the buttons. There are a total of 7 buttons; one for power (with indicator LEDs) and volume up and down all located on the rim of the headphones, and then a D-pad layout for call, play/pause, >> and &lt;&lt; on the outside of the right earphone. The buttons located on the rim are loose and feel cheap. Worst of all, they rattle when jogging. That clickety-clack is quite loud when it is right next to my ear, and it is distracting. The other buttons all work fine, though as other reviewers have noted the >> and &lt;&lt; buttons don't work with the iPhone/iPod Touch because of Apple's software. I've also found that I have to be a little careful in handling the headphones because it is easy to accidentally press the ""call"" button, which automatically triggers a call to the last person you called, and that can be somewhat embarrassing.My final annoyance is with the auto-power-off feature, which does not seem to actually work. The manual states that if the headphones are unused for 5 minutes, they will power down, but they obviously just go in to ""sleep"" mode and will automatically wake if there's an incoming call. This can be frustrating since the headphones might be 20 feet away in another room but when someone calls, the headphones will take over the call and I've found myself on many occasions talking into my phone while the person on the other end is talking through the headphones. This is, I'm sure, an issue that my phone is just as likely to be the cause of, but it's worth noting because it does happen a lot. Just make sure to turn the headphones off when not in use and it won't be a problem.Reading that last bit of my review one might get the idea that I'm not happy with these headphones, but that's not true; I think they're good for the price, and I would certainly recommend them to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive pair of wireless headphones for office or exercise. But those looking for the best at any price are likely to find more expensive headphones better.",4.0,1255219200,"10 11, 2009",Motorola S305 Bluetooth Stereo Headset w/ Microphone (Black) - Retail Packaging,37.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ddVQeCpOL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 958},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

Even put them aside for about a year... (Hey, I moved, changed jobs, etc.) Eventually, I came back across them and wanted to use them with a Gateway T-1628, Vista Sp2 laptop. I'd used them before on an XP machine, and they were, ""OK,"" so I thought, ""next."" But, Oh, baby - what a mess! Had to add a bluetooth adapter to the laptop... Fine. Until I tried several...

Range was the advertised 30 feet or so - even through the walls of the house. Early buyers apparently wanted to use these to exercise. No. These things would soak up water like a sponge and they have several obvious holes in them. But, for around the house stuff - light work - these have been fine.

Overall, I am very pleased with the gift.Connection: Easy to connect to iPhone - my primary device. And the range is suitable. I've run all over my first floor without an issue - clear all around. I don't see myself needing much more than that.Comfort: Putting your head on a pillow or leaning back on the couch? You may want to choose another headset as you may bump the neck wrap on these and push the headset around. Wearing a hat that goes past your ears (beanie)? This can be difficult (You can put the beanie over the headset in some cases). Glasses can be a pain too, depending on what style you have. However, if you are sitting up, walking around, no hat, wearing a baseball cap, etc., then these work great and are very comfortable. Where they wrap over the ears takes some time to get used to, but that's about it. I run with these, and they stay where they are supposed to and feel great, start to finish. Lightweight and cozy. And no wires!Sound: Pleasantly surprised. Excellent quality for a bluetooth headset. Music and calls come in crisp, clear, and perfect for my needs. The mic works great as well. I have had no complaints from those I've been speaking with regarding call quality, so I'm happy.Quality: The plastic wrap has a little give to it, but I don't want to put it to the test.

I'll be hunting for an adapter soon. I also wish there were controls on both ears. Maybe play on one ear and pause on the other.

They aren't meant to last through rigorous exercise routines. So if you are looking for a product fulfilling that purpose, then move on, they're not for you. The sound quality is surprisingly really good; the music comes through clear and crisp. On that topic, however, they could use improvement on interference and range, as you will notice gaps in playback if you stray too far away from your device (a microwave *as expected* causes the signal to stop working entirely). The construction does feel a bit fragile, but If handled with the care a high tech pair of headphones deserves then you'll be fine. They are extremely lightweight and feel natural when worn. The controls are conveniently placed and work great.

The speaker contains a rechargeable battery and there is a clear indication of when it needs to be charged and when the charging has been completed.  More on the charger and that ""clear indication"" in a bit.Pairing with my iPhone was immediate right out of the box.  I turned on the speaker, went to the bluetooth discover screen on my phone, it picked up the unpaired device, I entered the super-secret code number (0000), and it was done.Sound quality is good (for this type of speaker).  The sound is clear, there is very little (but at least some) bass, and it doesn't sound tinny.  I bought it for playing background music on the deck and it's certainly clear enough and there's definitely enough volume for that.The description implied and it should be clearly stated that in addition to working as a speaker this also works as a speaker phone and can also pass voice commands to the phone.  In fact it works just like the Motorola S9 headset except that forward and reverse don't seem to work with my iPhone4 (and it's much more difficult to wear as a headset).Now for the stupid decisions:There's a very bright and annoying light that insists on flashing when music is playing. According to the (well written) manual it means there's either a call or music on standby.  Near as I can tell there isn't.The AC charger is universal (at one end); it accepts 100-240V at 50/Hz.  It's the other end that I have issues with.  For some reason Motorola chose to use a micro-USB connector which is far from universal.  Even though it supplies 5VDC just like any other USB power supply if you lose theirs then you're out of luck.  (OK, I realize that this speaker was designed to accompany the Motorola E8 phone and that device used the same micro-USB connector.  Frankly, if I was reviewing that phone I would have the same complaint.)The less than universal foolishness doesn't end with the AC supply.  Since the connector is less than standard you need to get a special cable if you want to, say, not bother with a special charger and use your laptop to charge the speakers.  Guess what isn't included...Minor annoyances aside, this speaker is a good value.  You can share music from your mobile device at good volume and reasonable fidelity while keeping said mobile device on your person.

B002LZDK7W,A6FIAB28IS79,Samuel Chell,"[0, 1]","For a low-priced, wireless, rechargeable speaker, this mini Motorola speaker synchs up perfectly with just about any bluetooth-transmitting item.  The system is well thought out and is fully outfitted--with AC adapter, Motorola case, and mine even came with a Motorola cinch sack. Also, since Bluetooth can be temperamental, or erratic (especially with other Bluetooth-connected electronics devices in the near vicinity), a convenient audio cable is provided for a surefire connection between player and the Motorola speaker.The speaker is loud enough and should amplify the human voice sufficiently for efficient, unforced conversation.  But anyone who claims this speaker excells at musical reproduction simply has no use for bass frequencies, which for the most part are inaudible on the EQ5.  The Motorola EQ7, on the other hand, covers the entire frequency range, its four JBL speakers constructing a soundstage and providing a sense of life-like presence and vivid realism simply unequaled by any other bluetooth speaker.  Since the beginning of the year the EQ5 qppears to have more than doubled in price, making several other bluetooth speakers a better value--at least for anyone seeking full-frequencied music reproduction.  Logitech, Creative, and Spracht all make bluettoth speakers capable of rich, full-bodied, hi-fidelity music reproduction, though the Motorola EQ7 emerged a clear-cut winner in my side by side comparisons.  It's the first time I've heard a walkman-sized speaker practically equal the thunder of a ""home theater"" system.  If you think you could handle not a facsimile but Oscar Peterson's piano, Ray Brown's bass, and Bobby Durham's drum kit--or Joey DeFrancesco's Hammond B3--transplanted into your listening space, the EQ7 is the real ""sleeper"" among all portable personal speakers.",4.0,1292544000,"12 17, 2010",Motorola EQ5 Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker,51.41,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31GYNGTwUuL.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 233358},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Bluetooth Speakers'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Car Accessories', 'Car Speakerphones'], ['Electronics', 'Car & Vehicle Electronics', 'Vehicle Electronics Accessories', 'Audio & Video Accessories', 'Bluetooth Car Kits']]"

I really liked it so when I went looking for a charger to power my other comparable micro-USB accessories I couldn't help but be drawn to it.I've read reviews that stated that the product is ""generic"" or doesn't charge correctly (which, as an avid vehicle cusomizer, I have generally determined through testing that its usually a charging system problem rather than the charger...or it's simply being plugged into a device that does not meet or exceeds the tech specs!)I anxiously awaited receipt of the charger and was pleased when I pulled it out of the packaging to find it in a Motorola retail packaging. I will also add that it is BETTER than the one that originally came with my phone! Much more even blue light output and exactly the same performance!This is NOT an imitation! This is the real deal and, generally, looks better than the one you get with your phone when you buy it!Many have said the blue light is ""too bright"" or ""distracting""....well, it all depends on where your accessory plug is and how dark the dash lighting is in your vehicle. I have a 07 Mustang with the color-changing dash lights...they are currently set to blue and I barely notice the blue from the charger.

I get a good few percentage points gain, even in this high draw condition, every 10 minutes or so.Best of all, the charger does it for more than a month or so.  This thing has lasted a couple of years without the connector or the power connector falling apart- huzzah! The bits and pieces feel as though they are actually assembled rather than just placed in close proximity to one another like so many pieces of junk other vendors sell.The only downfall or fault I've found is the rather bright, blue LED lighting which fills the ""M"" that serves as a gripping point for the power connector.  The good news it's easy to remove from the connector the bad news is you'll likely need to carefully aim this light if you want to see at night inside your car.  It's really that bright; not sure why so many vendors feel it necessary to light everything... I mean I could understand a small led or marker in the USB connector- I mean that is always falling into the gap between the console and the seat or disappearing into some unknown area on the floor so that we are left trying to trace our way from the cigarette lighter down the cord to the usb connector- am I right? The need for a light at the power connector though, I just don't get- it's always in the same place and it's way to bright.

B002VZPC14,A294SHLWPSG1BP,Ryan Winkleman,"[4, 4]","I bought this charger as a cheap extra to keep at the office rather than having to remember to bring my original DROID charger back and forth every day. For the price it's a good buy, but it does have its good and bad aspects:Good- The head of the charger (that plugs into the outlet) is the same size as the charger that comes with the DROID. I don't know what comes with the other Android phones, but it matches the size of the DROID's charger. If you keep your charger plugged in behind a nightstand or something then you won't have to worry about adjusting it if you're replacing with this one.- The cord is about six feet long, which makes it about twice as long as the cord that comes with the phone. This makes it ideal for plugging into an outlet at the floor behind your desk, since you shouldn't have to worry about the cord not being long enough.Bad- The cord is not a USB cable. It is attached to the head of the charger, so you can only use this for charging your phone, not for plugging it into your computer. This may not be an issue for you, but it is important to point out.- The cord is not thick like the original charger cord. This is a thin cord with a partition down the center, similar to many standard power cords. If you aren't abusing it you should be fine, but take note that this doesn't have the thick, round cord that the original charger did.- My charger is slow. I know some people said their phones charged faster, but it took me 2.5 - 3 hours to charge my phone from 0 the other night. With the original charger it would take about half that time for me. This doesn't matter for me since I'll be using it at my desk at work and won't need quick charges, but depending on your needs this may be a big problem and may not be.Overall the two biggest points to keep in mind for this charger are that its cord is about twice the length of the one on the charger that comes with the DROID and that it does not have USB capabilities. If you don't need it to plug into your computer, I suggest you go ahead and get it. It's very inexpensive and the longer cord makes it much more accommodating than the original charger.",4.0,1294012800,"01 3, 2011",OEM Universal microUSB Home Travel AC Charger for Verizon Blackberry Z10 Motorola Droid A855 Cell Phone,1.6,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411YFUF7CrL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 26544},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Travel Chargers']]"

I know there's a Droid car mount, but I drive a lot and I wanted something to mount it in without the need to plug it in every time I got in my Jeep, and vice versa when I got out.  So I use this mount and it works great.There are a few things I'd like changed with it though:-no contact list icon on the ""dock home screen"", so if you want to make a phone call, you have to either pull it out of the dock station, or you have to press the ""exit dock screen"" button, then hit your contacts button.-no wallpaper support-no color selection support (only two colors; night and day modes, which is dark red or light blue)-when a call comes in, it still asks you to slide the bar to the right to answer it, which is annoying to do while docked-also when a call comes in, if you answer the call and the phone's still docked, you'd assume it would use a bluetooth headset if attached, or automatically activate speakerphone but it doesn't - you have to slide the button across to answer then press the ""speaker"" button once the call connects-also when a call comes in (and with some other phone features), the display still shows in vertical mode even though its docked horizontally-this may be a smaller thing, but, since I use it in my Jeep, I don't like that the weather doesn't update once you've moved your location - I think it just updates to your location once it initially docks, but not continuously as it updates, which is weird because it constantly updates the weather forecast, but not the location? weird.-fixed angle (you can't lean the Droid closer or further away, it sits at the preset angle you see in the pics)There's probably a few more small ones, but I can't remember right now.As I said though, even after these nitpicks of mine, I still love being able to dock my Droid so it charges without having to plug it in.

The dock itself is very well made and is quite hefty in weight.  You won't be accidentally knocking this dock around from your desk especially since it also has a non-skid base.  The dock has a micro USB port that you plug the cable into and then you plug the other end into the AC adapter.  This of course, powers and charges your Droid, which is perfect for your nightstand.  If you want to sync your Droid, just plug the micro USB cable into your PC.  This will charge your Droid too, but at a much slower rate and only when your PC is powered on.When you dock the Droid in, the orientation changes automatically to landscape.  You select what city you want your weather widget to display and boing, you have your multimedia station.  The dock has magnets located in specific areas to activate this mode, which I just found can be activated by using an app called ""Dockrunner.""  It is available for download in the Marketplace.It's a little pricey for what it does but it is cool nonetheless.

I have a power source directly below my nightstand where the dock is located. It's just an average sized night stand yet and could not be closer to the power source. However, the dock has to sit a bit sideways on my night stand because at the ""correct"" angle, the cord won't reach. It's that short. Think about it... 3 feet. How high is your night stand? You can replace with just a longer usb cable and their AC to USB adapter that comes with it, but for that price you really shouldn't have to.

Because that is pretty much all it does (except it also charges the onboard battery).The dock triggers the phone to enter ""dock mode"", but the dock mode can be triggered by a free program from the AppMarket called DockRunner (Droid), no dock needed.And really, the dock mode, as shown in the picture, turns your phone into a bedside alarm clock. You can set alarm, trigger ""night mode"" (softer contrast), and even get a preview of the weather, among a few other minor passive functions. You *could* make it also play music in the background (yes, the built-in MUSIC app has a jukebox mode), so I guess it's more of a clock-radio with alarm.If I really want a clock radio with alarm, I would buy one in my local Walgreens (or whatever) for $10, not pay $20-$30 for a fancy piece of shaped plastic with a charger tip.As many others have pointed out, the dock is designed for an UNPROTECTED NAKED PHONE. It is not compatible with cases. If you have a case slipped on, you cannot put it in the dock.While, technically if you don't want the BOTTOM half protected, then you can remove *THAT* and put the phone in the dock with the keyboard exposed, but that rather defeats the aesthetics of the dock. Doesn't it?There is ONE good thing about the dock though... The AC adapter you get with it can be used WITHOUT the dock. Yes, you can plug that tip straight to the phone, skipping the dock altogether. Since a spare AC adapter cost the same as the dock on the Verizon website, you may as well get the dock.If you already have alarm clocks and such, then this accessory is superfluous, except it looks cool.

B002WB2P76,A22JNORZI4KPAP,Terrance Shaw,"[5, 5]","I got my DROID back in November of 2009, shortly after they were first released, and I was instantly satisfied with it.  Unfortunately, what I would come to find out is that although there was no shortage of the phones themselves, or the car GPS mount (which I also ended up buying), there was a distinct shortage of the multimedia docks.There were workarounds, of course: you could go and buy a cheap knockoff of the mount, designed to merely hold the DROID in such a way as to allow you to snake your power cable through a slot, and have a magnet hit the DROID in just the right way so as to bring up the clock interface.It just wouldn't have been the same, I thought to myself.And in the end, I now know with complete certainty that I was right in that mindset.The dock is very simple in construction: it's a weighted base with rubber feet to maintain traction on most surfaces, with a brushed aluminum surface.  The phone sits very securely on the power receptacle in the provided groove, and there's no wobble if you go to interact with the screen while docked.That being said, I guess I could see where some people would have grief with it: it IS very limited in what it'll allow to fit in the dock.  That is, it's only gonna seat your phone, and nothing else.  If you have one of those Bodyglove-type cases, you're gonna have to remove it before you can dock.In the end, I can't see that as being a problem as I've never used a case for the DROID.  The screen is, as far as I can tell, quite oleophobic (meaning you give it a quick wipe with a cloth, your shirt, etc., and it comes clean) and is very resistant to scratches, and the rest of the phone is just as resilient it seems.  In the five months I've owned my phone, it has yet to take any damage.But yes, the dock is an incredible (and well worth it, in my opinion) purchase to accompany your DROID.  It gives you immediate and intuitive access to the clock app (which you can access without it, of course), and charges your phone, while at the same time allowing you a way to steady the phone for interaction as you lounge in bed.My only complaint would be that although you can dim the screen of the DROID, it doesn't dim/turn off the menu strip of buttons along the bottom edge of the phone.  But then, that's a DROID issue, not a dock issue.Well worth the cost, I'd highly recommend this product to all DROID owners.",5.0,1268006400,"03 8, 2010",Motorola Droid Multimedia Dock (Retail Packaging) - compatible with the first Droid A855,4.5,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-9NZUG4PL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 31695},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Car Accessories', 'Car Cradles & Mounts']]"

You can use software to go into the same mode as the dock for free, so YMMV.I appreciate the design.  It's heavy enough to not get knocked around too easily on my desk, and my wife keeps hers in the kitchen.  It would work equally well as an alarm clock/night stand device.  We got these with our 2 droids since it was a nice refined way to charge them and still get plenty of functionality (weather/time/music) at a visible angle.Pros:1. Well weighted with rubberized bottom keeps it from bouncing around easily2. Designed nicely - Looks sharp.  The Droid's audio is surprising clear in speaker mode for playing music (especially for such a small speaker), but a Bluetooth or corded headset (or speaker setup) would work here.3. Nice angle for keeping an eye on the clock.  I'm hoping Google improves the interface... the weather section is a bit small and doesn't give much info.  A real-time radar with more info would be best and perhaps a smaller alarm clock with more configuration/personalization options for color, stock ticker, etc. would be great.  But this doesn't affect my review of the dock.4. Fits perfectly and makes it easy to remember where you left your phone.  :-)Cons:1. I thought that the cable for USB/DC Converter was a bit short.  It's the same as the one that came with the Droid.  Nothing that can't be amended, but for $30 they couldn't throw in another meter?2. It boils down to being a weighted/angled slot with charger/usb cable for $30.  It probably amounts to $2 in materials if that.  It would be expensive at $15.3. It really doesn't deliver much.  You can get everything but the pre-positioned angle without the doc, and the doc software needs improvement (not a slam on the dock itself, just pointing it out).  Unless you're really using it as an alarm clock, It's difficult to see the point now that I have it.  If you're watching movies on it as a sort of TV replacement, then maybe... yeah.4. No cases allowed (it won't fit with them on).In the end, it is well built and designed nicely.  I think it should offer more for the money (maybe built in speakers?) but it is what it is, an overpriced accessory, and for what it's worth, usually overpriced accessories are built like junk, so this gets a 4.",4.0,1260489600,"12 11, 2009",Motorola Droid Multimedia Dock (Retail Packaging) - compatible with the first Droid A855,4.5,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-9NZUG4PL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 31695},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Car Accessories', 'Car Cradles & Mounts']]"

The micro-USB is sized smaller than usual to allow for smooth docking**. When it's in the dock the screen display turns into a clock/weather-station. You can change from color-scheme from day-time to night-time with a single touch. The weather is shown full-time in the lower left corner and updates frequently to stay current. The base is solid and heavy and has tacky feet so it's not likely to slide off your night-stand or desk.The incline is steeper than it looks in the photo, but I think that was deliberate. When it's sitting on my desk, the phone is squared to my perspective. You can still manipulate controls when it's in the dock. None of the controls are blocked by the station. So you can watch movies or Youtube while it's in the stand. You can even slide the screen up and do a little texting but that's not very ergonomic (carpal tunnel!!). Sliding the screen up also give it a slightly higher perch, which makes it slightly more comfortable when watching videos. Otherwise, you're looking down just enough for your neck to get sore. 2 hours into an intense movie, straining your eyes on the tiny but very crisp screen, you're going strain your neck.So the station is well-designed, but it does NOT fit a phone with a protective case. If you have a case on your Droid and you don't want to take it off every time you use the docking station, you'll have to buy Seidio's cradle.**Jacks are normally sized large for a tight fit so it won't fall off by accident. You'll notice you have to tug a bit to get the jack free. The phone is held in place by gravity and therefore doesn't need a snug fit. When you slide this into place, you don't feel any resistance at all.

Android phones are getting well known for going way beyond what current smartphones can do, and a dock that could live up to that standard should have been thought through.  The buttons on the phone don't lend well to alarm clock functions because of their size and location.  Placing these functions on the dock would have been impressive and much more useful.  Also, I find it strange that they wouldn't run audio through the dock.  Apple has been doing that since first version.  Instead, you have an audio jack sticking out the side of the phone, which is ugly and takes up more space.The base station is precisely this: an option to display your phone more upright (on its side), a magnet to auto-start the alarm clock mode, and a battery charger.  If that's all that you're looking for, you'll love it.  Docking stations for non-Apple phones is somewhat of a new idea, so this is a fair first.  But it could have been designed with more intelligent features in mind.  For a phone touted to be so smart, the docking station lacks.Pros:1. Weighted base2. Polished, looks nice3. Does the job4.

B002Y3BYQA,A294SHLWPSG1BP,Ryan Winkleman,"[0, 0]","I have mixed feelings about this Motola mount. The actual mount itself is great. It can be attached to either your windshield or dashboard (I choose the latter), it can be adjusted very easily, it is literally a snap to put in or remove the phone with the easy release button on top, it can be oriented horizontal or vertical for the phone, and the phone automatically enters car mode when it connects and exits car mode upon disconnecting. Again, the mount itself is great.However, I have two major problems with the product as a whole. After only a couple months I noticed that one day I was driving and the mount just fell forward onto my dashboard and off the bottom adhesive. I put it back up but this is still a frequent problem and I typically have to reach up and push the mount down onto the adhesive as I start to see it lifting up slightly. I assume this is a heat problem, as it doesn't seem to be an issue when it's cloudy or at night; just when it's sunny and hot. So that is one problem. The other is that it is just impractical in the first place to mount on the windshield or dash if you live somewhere with a sun that comes out and actually plan on using the phone for navigation or anything that requires the screen to be on. The Droid heats up fairly quickly when its screen is on and the CPU is actively working (such as for navigation). If it is a sunny day, all the plastic in the mount absorbs the heat and transfers it right into the phone, increasing the heat by a lot. I have a battery meter app, and I have literally seen my phone sit in excess of 130 degrees on my dashboard on a hot day while I'm driving. Not only is this excessive heat bad, but it makes it impractical to use for navigation for a long period because the phone will not charge at that temperature, *even when plugged in* (try it and see). It will discharge and your battery will drop fairly quickly, putting you at risk for having a dead phone if you're not keeping an eye on its battery meter.The bottom line is that the mount itself works great. I think it is perfect the way it is. However, I hesitate to recommend it if you live in a sunny area because mounting your phone in plain sun exposure will cause it to heat up very quickly and by default cause the battery to discharge whether plugged in or not. If you live somewhere where the sun is hidden more than out, then you're in luck...but in a sunny area you may think twice before getting this kind of mount.

The mount holds the phone great, turns it to car-ready mode, and works exactly as expected...when there isn't a case being used.As a disclaimer, I will say that before purchasing this mount, *I KNEW* that it wouldn't work with ANY TYPE of case on the Droid.However, there-in lies my gripe with this product.  It's not so much what the product doesn't do that it's supposed to...it's more what it SHOULD do that it wasn't designed to.  It is beyond my comprehension as to why Motorola would create such a great mount without even bothering to make it either (A) modify to accompany some sort of a case, or (B) offer 2 versions of the mount, one of those being for someone with some sort of a protective case.  Even if it would only accompany a Motorola-brand case, it would have been nice to at least have the option.  Why would Motorola offer cases for the Droid, but then step on its own feet and require any type of case be taken off to use it?  For many people who are starting to use the Droid to stream/play music in their cars, the phone is mounted almost every time they get in the car.  Many cases can be quite the pain to remove, as most aren't meant to be removed regularly.  While this mount is very convenient to both mount and remove, it still lacks compatibility with...well, pretty much anything but the plain droid.I gave this mount 4 stars for the reason that it did succeed wonderfully in doing everything it was advertised to, but that it's requirements of a bare-back setup on a $400+ phone seems foolish, especially with so much of the push from both the manufacturer and the cell phone provider to use some sort of a protective case.  If both were serious about pushing you to use a case, one would think that they would have at least designed a mount to accompany it.",4.0,1280620800,"08 1, 2010",Motorola DROID 1st Generation Vehicle Dock with Rapid Car Charger (Retail Packaging),7.49,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KJRCn%2B8HL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 41870},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Car Accessories', 'Car Cradles & Mounts', 'Car Mounts']]"

The OEM battery is a much better power supply.  It actually lasts longer than a few months, which is more than I can say for the Innocell battery I purchased.Review:I enjoy my Droid phone and with my usage, I go through batteries quickly. You can conserve power by turning off options you are not using (Bluetooth, 3G, Screen Brightness, GPS, Wi-Fi, Checking Email) but sometimes I forget or don't want to cut my features. I got a spare Original Equipment Manufacturer battery and an extended life battery at the same time.  This is an OEM battery worked properly from the start, unlike the extended life battery which needed to be ""trained"" in the phone.  I could not tell the difference in run time between this battery and the one that came with my phone from Verizon.The GoodThe battery fits in my Motorola car dock, which I use all the time.  It also fits in my desktop charging dock which I like to use. The Extended life battery does not fit the Motarola car dock or the desktop charging dock  The OEM battery does not add bulk to the phone.The BadThe OEM battery does not last as long with the features most people use turned on.  It is a pain to have to manage phone usage to keep the battery alive.  I am a heavy user of ""Advanced Task Killer"" which I usually access by holding down the Home key.ConclusionI am happy with the purchase.  I chose my battery according to what my use will be.

It is a bit of a gamble buying these batteries but fortunately it doesn't involve much money. The first time I purchased inexpensive Droid batteries from Amazon I received two batteries (from UnitedIntegral according to Amazon's order history page). Each worked for about three hours after my older, original battery lasted at least twice that. They clearly were not real OEM batteries (or were defective), but at the price I didn't mind too much. For the price it was still of value to have spares on me in case my main battery died while traveling, even if I did have to change the battery twice on some days.Obviously having extra batteries with a full charge is much better, and I tried again more recently from another seller (listed as OEM Planet in the order history page). This time both batteries are lasting longer than the original battery in the phone (presumably being true OEM batteries with my original battery now having a reduced life due to age). The original battery typically had to be recharged in late afternoon. The last two batteries I received typically last into the evening, allowing me to wait until I'm home to recharge.I'm not certain if the listings as to where each battery came from is accurate as when I click on the first order listed as from UnitedIntegral I get to a page for OEM Planet. When I clicked on the more recent order which lists as OEM Planet on the history page, I wind up at a page saying yet a third company, Accessory One.When I tried to write a review of the second set I wound up on the same page as the review I wrote of the first set despite receiving them from different sellers and a considerable difference between the two.

B003DQD5CS,A38US3BI4PEJ5O,NARNTEK3049,"[0, 0]","Was VERY happy with it for the first 4 months of owning it, and couldn't imagine a better phone. I could do my emails, read texts, and play music at the same time. I could GO ON THE WEB and stay in a phone convo at the same time. Just was amazing and the phone didn't limit what I did.The first issue I encountered was the battery. It barely lasted 8 hours, and that's with background syncing and all that stuff backlight all that turned down. You'd be lucky to get 1 hour at best if all that was on. I got the extended battery, and when it helped, it somehow made my screen go nuts. No joke, put the old one in and the device screen works and never an issue. The extended battery, it scrolls, clicks n things, and the landscape mode didn't work. Motorola tech support recommended a full reset, so I had to set up everything once more.The next issue I had was the music player integration. I can BLUETOOTH myself MP3 songs that AUTOMATICALLY are stored to the 8GB factory included SD card (finally), but they do not have any sort of identification. It says the track name- but with the track number, they are only in numeric order for example 01-&#34;Only Time&#34; The album names for everything that is Bluetoothed over is Bluetooth. It doesn't drag over the album name, and the artist simply reads unknown. I tried the USB with the same result, so i guess it's not all the bluetooth.And while the ANDROID 2.1.1 Android operating system is a joy to use, you cannot save APPS to your SD card. This leads to small lagginess, such as Angry Birds, takes literally 2 minutes to fling the next bird. As far as I was told, processor speed has nothing do with this, and as this was a premium phone, I'd think it had a good processor in it.Overall:It wows, but it could be better. Do I recommend it, yes, somewhat, if it can have it's issues fixed. I guess if you don't mind the SD issue it'd be a perfect phone, but unfortunately I decided it was something I didn't want to use and upgraded.",3.0,1404604800,"07 6, 2014",Motorola Droid A855 CDMA (Black) QWERTY Android Touch-Screen Smart Phone,81.69,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31a3hclTF5L._SY300_.jpg,,Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones']]"
B003DQD5CS,A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,"Richard Baker ""BinaryMessiah""","[3, 4]","The Good: Excellent design, lots of power, superb features from Google, amazing cameraThe Bad: App store is still young, processes running in the background kills battery life, keyboard is a bit cumbersomeGoogle as been known for revolutionizing the internet and now they are with their Android phones. The Motorola DROID (A855) is the newest and most advanced phone on the market right now, and this bad boy does an awful lot. A lot of people are going to compare this phone to the iPhone, but the DROID trumps the iPhone in features, and freedom. I will discuss, first, the tech specs and compare them to the iPhone head-to-head so you can see how powerful the DROID truly is.Techno BabbleThe DROID has a 550 MHz processor, and to be specific the Arm Cortex A8 processor that is also present in the iPhone 3GS by Samsung. The 3GS is clocked only 50 MHz higher and can be overclocked to 800 MHz. To compare that the original Xbox has a 733 MHz processor. So can the DROID be overclocked to this as well? Most likely. With a monster processor the DROID can multitask and has one of the first actual mobile OS (besides Windows Mobile 7). This also means maintaining processes running in the background to gain battery life, uninstalling apps (not just deleting them), and a lot more, but we'll get to that later. The iPhone however can not multitask due to the OS running on it, and the processor is only used in games.When it comes to graphics the DROID still hasn't been pushed to its limits. There are very few 3D games on the Android market, but as of right now the iPhone stomps the DROID in the graphics department. The DROID has a 200 MHZz PowerVR SGX 530 GPU. The iPhone has the same, but due to the slightly better CPU is can currently outperform the DROID. The iPhone has been on the market for quite some time, so there are bigger better games available. The DROID should start getting the same quality soon. They both have 256MB of RAM, so under the hood they are pretty much the same.The DROID has a slightly bigger screen sizing in at 3.7' and the iPhone at 3.5'. Does 2 millimeters matter? Yes it does. There is a good 2 millimeters on the top of the iPhone that could be screen, but for some unknown reason it's not. The DROID has a higher resolution of 854480 and 265 ppi (pixels per inch). The 3GS has a 320480 resolution with only 163 ppi so the DROID has double the resolution of the iPhone. That is great for people wanting to watch high-res movies on their device.Both devices have the same input such as the 3 axis accelerometer (tilt sensor), digital compass, Multi-touch display, proximity and ambient light sensors etc. The DROID is a bit heavier than the 3GS, but only by 1.2 oz. The DROID wipes the floor with the 3GS' camera. The DROID camera is 5MP compared to the 3GS 3MP. The DROID has dual LED flash, and geotagging and it can even run higher than 30 FPS. The 3GS has all this except the dual LED flash and this is a huge plus.When it comes to storage the DROID wins with its external memory option. You can insert up to a 32GB micro-SD card, but you're stuck with the 3GS' internal memory and have to pay a huge price for more. The DROID even comes with a 16GB micro- card when you buy the phone. So when it comes to comparing junk under the hood they both have the same hardware, but the DROID has the extra tidbits that push it over the edge.GUI: Graphical User InterfaceThe DROID has an excellent GUI and the whole marketplace is run by the community. There are programs such as PandaHome, OpenHome, GDEHome etc that allow you to change ""themes"" for a small price or for free. These also change icons, clock widgets etc. The DROID has a great interface that is more like a computer that gives you a desktop, then a slide up menu where all your apps are stored. You can drag and drop as you see fit. The iPhone, however, is plagued with the mundane Apple OS that only show apps in a grid format with a black background. Sure you can change your ""wallpaper"" but this is only when the phone comes out of sleep mode so it's rarely seen. This makes every iPhone look the same so the DROID wins in customization by a long shot. There are four touch buttons located at the bottom of the screen which are your back button, menu, home, and search. You will use these buttons a lot so Motorola and Google were smart to put these here.Apps: Who's Better?It all comes down to the apps. Who has more right? Well the iTunes marketplace has hundreds of thousands of apps that the DROID doesn't have so the iPhone wins there. However, the Android market is ever-growing, and thanks to the user run community a lot of great apps are showing up that the iPhone can't run. These include a lot of customization apps and loads more. Apps are easier to run on the DROID since there is no iTunes type program. The app store is run off the phone, downloaded from the phone as well. If you don't want an app anymore you go to your settings and uninstall it. Google also allows you to refund anything you buy within 24 hours and Apple does not support this. While iTunes may have more stuff, Android has better customer service and a better community and setup. There are really no ""hardcore"" games for the DROID like there is for the iPhone, but it's getting there. You do not want to get a DROID for a gaming system just yet for sure; stick with your iPod/phone.Features: Welcome to Google TownThe DROID has a lot of little things going on in it. You can do everything a touch screen phone can do, but it also has a slide out QWERTY keyboard. The buttons were a little flat and the top row is hard to get at if you have big fingers, but it works well. If you tilt the phone sideways you can type with a landscape keyboard or use Google text-to-speech. I found this feature extremely useful when typing long messages or writing reviews for apps. Since this is a Google phone you get all their awesome apps such as Google Earth (yes it's in 3D and you can see every detail), and Google maps. Switch to your ""car app"" and press navigation. Speak your selection (i.e. Phoenix, Arizona) and Google will give you directions for a car, bus, or walking (God forbid you walk that far!). Press get navigate and the phone will speak you the directions. It doesn't update in real-time, but it does update as you drive down each block.Google Sky is a fun app that lets you point your phone in the sky and it will show you, in real-time, where each constellation and planet is. You get plenty of excellent Google apps such as Gmail, YouTube (yeah Google owns YouTube), and Google Goggles which allows you to take pictures of products or objects and the phone will scan it and search it for you. There's even a Google search bar on the desktop with a text-to-speech button next to it. Brilliant. There are plenty of other apps such as the Amazon store, eBay, Bank of America, MLIA, FML, and even ShopSaavy. This app allows you to scan a barcode and it will tell you where you can find it cheaper online or locally. Of course you have all your social networking apps like Twitter, Facebook, and MySpace which run great.When it comes to things like ringtones, pictures, and videos, so the DROID delivers. You can store any MP3, or picture and set them as wallpapers, notifications, or just ringtones. Mount your SD card via USB and just create the folders. No having to sync with a program on the PC. Total freedom is what Google gives you and this is what I love.Problems: It's Not PerfectThere are some issues with the DROID, but not many and they are minor. The biggest one is the running processes in the background that can kill your battery even in sleep mode. You have to get the Advanced App Killer app and every so often check everything you don't want running and kill the apps. Another problem I ran into was that since most of the apps are user made they can be glitchy and screw up your phone so watch out and read reviews before downloading anything. You could say that the major issue is the app store. There is a lot of apps, but some of it is junk. There aren't any excellent games available, and the app store doesn't have any sort feature except Top Paid, Top Free, and Just In.For a $550 phone (if you pay for it without  a plan) the DROID delivers and trumps the iPhone in every direction except the apps. The DROID is a very advanced phone, and is for people who love using their phones constantly and make it a part of their every day life. With a sleek design, excellent features, sturdy hardware, and monster processing power the DROID should be the #1 phone in 2010.Update: 10/15/2011Now after I have had this phone for 18 months I don't like it as much. The phone started having issues with serious lag, slowdown, and just hardly responds anymore. The touch screen lost sensitivity after about a year, plus the hardware is ancient compared to what is out now. Due to that all the apps are now optimized for higher end phones so the Droid is left in the dust.Overall the phone just doesn't really work anymore internally. It won't come out of sleep mode some times, won't answer calls, turns off randomly, and the internet is just impossible to surf due to the now weak processor. Hardware wise it has stood the test of time with many drops, slides, fumbles, and kicks. Not a single crack or anything, but thankfully this phone is now discontinued. If you have the original Droid you are probably finding the same problems even after a factory reset. The phone was great 22 months ago, but now I just absolutely hate this thing. If I were to amend my score I would give it a 4/10 now, but of course that's unfair and should be remembered for how great it was at the time of release. Did I also mention that the appraisal price for the phone is about $20 now-a-days?",2.0,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",Motorola Droid A855 CDMA (Black) QWERTY Android Touch-Screen Smart Phone,81.69,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31a3hclTF5L._SY300_.jpg,,Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones']]"

B0042I3J1I,A6SO1CY6VID67,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","I love my Droid X, and find it to be better than my original Droid in almost every fashion. Unfortunately, the desk dock accessory is one of the things that was superior on the D1.Things I like about this product: Performs more or less as it should. The charger cord is permanently affixed to this dock, and is a lot longer than the charger cord they give you with the phone and with the dock I had for my D1. The phone knows when it's docked and will launch the dock screen for you-- and if you have other apps installed that have dock integration (like an alarm clock, for instance), it will give you the option to launch those instead.Things I don't like about this dock: The phone sits in there so snugly it can be difficult to seat and difficult to take out. This is the result of the HDMI port-- both the power port and the HDMI port lock into the phone from this dock, and seating the phone on both, perfectly and simultaneously, takes a bit of maneuvering. Taking it out is worse, you have to pull up on the phone at exactly the right angle to get it dislodged. Since I undock it immediately when I wake up in the morning and am still a bit groggy, this is a pain in the rear.Overall it's better than leaving it on the bedside table laying down, it's not perfect either.

The dock does what it says it will do, and does it well. However docking the phone smoothly is difficult. The phone may become momentarily confused if you bump the connectors while docking. Also, sometimes the lit buttons on the phone stay lit for some reason, instead of going dark after a few seconds. I wish there was a way to delay the recognition that it is being docked for maybe 5 seconds. I use Go Launcher with the screen orientation locked to portrait. That arrangement does not work well with the dock--if you touch the connectors briefly while trying to dock the phone, the Go Launcher home screen will become frazzled (wallpaper off size, some icons appear scrambled, some areas of the screen look strange) and stay that way AFTER undocking.

B0042I7AUE,A8O2PYQQ4NVKO,Bob 2012,"[0, 0]","The Droid X OEM car dock is a good product, and includes the Motorola charger as well. Here's my opinion.Pros1. Nice mounting method. The rubber suction cup is tensioned using a lever to get better vacuum. It seems to be a growing trend and certainly a welcome one. Also included is an aluminum ring with 2-faced mounting foam if you want to mount the unit off your windshield.2. Motorola charger included!  If fits, and works quite well - at least for me.3. While I don't use the ""Auto"" menu often, it does display in a darker color - good for night driving.4. Great for navigation and phone reception. It's not really a feature of the dock - but since most people will have this on their windshield - you'll get better reception for GPS and phone. I travel a lot and this makes a big difference for me.Cons1. Size - The case seems big and could block some of your view. I placed mine in the left corner of my windshield where my inspection sticker blocks the view anyway. It also lets me get close to the phone if I need to hit the screen to answer a call.2. Charger might not be for everyone. The Motorola charger looks really nice. It has a glass ring that glows blue with the Motorola logo. It's nice to look at but might be too bright when driving at night. It also might not fit well with some automotive plug locations. Check out the photos and see for yourself.3. The dock removes from the mounting bracket by simply sliding it up and out. It might be a bonus if you want to hold the phone in the mount, but it makes removing the phone from the dock itself with one hand difficult (you need one hand to hold the dock in the mount, and one hand to pull out the phone).

It automatically starts the CarDock program on the phone (either the one that came with the phone or others that you can download from the Market).Motorola paid close attention to detail to get the Droid X to do exactly what you would expect it to do while in CarDock mode: it automatically pauses the music player when receiving a call, all calls go into Speaker mode automatically, you can have your most frequently called numbers at your fingertips, etc. If you use Google Navigation (which I have given up my dedicated Garmin GPS for) then a car mount is a must buy because of the battery drain it puts on the phone.The car mount makes all this possible. The mount does have a spot to receive the microUSB power cable so you don't have to fiddle with the power cord each time you put the phone in or out of the mount.

They were even bold enough to place a label over where they opened packaging that said it was opened to ""inspect"" the contents.  What they really did was take out the Motorola rapid rate charger and replace it with a (very) cheap imitation.  I'm sure they're selling that on here separately as well.  The imitation charger cable does not fit very well, and is barely long enough to reach from the power outlet to the mount on the window.*Update*  In addition to my qualms with the seller, this product was just poorly designed by motorola.  When mounted to the windshield, the arm is just unnecessarily long and because of it, the device vibrates terribly when idling - causing an audible and annoying sound to come through the mic to the person on the end of the call.  Within a few weeks of using, the mechanism that locked the phone holder into the rest of the unit wore out and it no longer locked in place, creating a very insecure fit.  I finally replaced my DX with an SIII and bought the samsung infuse car mount.  That mount is MUCH better quality.

B0042I7AUE,A2OKRGHIYTBQ6P,"Lewis A. Edge Jr. ""Happy Traveler""","[0, 0]","This mount is essential if you plan to use the GPS capabilities of your Droid X.  Since many vehicle dashboards, including mine, have a textured surface, Motorola supplies a self-adhesive disk that will accommodate the car mount even on textured surfaces, but my best results came from sticking the suction cup directly to my windshield.  Such an arrangement places the phone's screen at an ideal distance for me to see it clearly without having to take my eyes off of the road.  It also makes it easy for me to switch the mount to another car if necessary, while leaving no evidence of the previous installation.  Dropping the phone into the mount causes the phone to display a different screen, appropriate for vehicle use, that can be customized.  If the phone rings, while in the mount, I just touch the ""Answer"" button to use the phone hands-free.The rapid charger cable plugs into the back of the car mount and the phone connects with a plug mounted in the cradle.  Since this mount gives a glove-like fit to the phone, it won't accommodate the phone if it's in a protective case or has a thicker, high-capacity battery installed.  However, since the plugged-in car mount supplies power to the phone while it's guiding you to your destination and the car mount provides solid protection for the phone as well, neither of those other two accessories would be necessary until you remove your phone from the mount.After using my car dock for more than a year, I bought a second one for my motor home.  It attached conveniently to the driver's side window and sits within easy reach and view on the dashboard.  Owning a second dock saves me the hassle of moving the one from my car.  When I upgraded my old Droid X to a Droid Razr Maxx HD I discovered that I could remove the insert from this vehicle dock, then grind the lower left interior side of the tray to expand its width about 1/8"" and this dock will accommodate my new phone.",4.0,1298764800,"02 27, 2011",Motorola Vehicle Dock for DROID X &amp; Droid X2 with Rapid Car Charger - Motorola Retail Packaging,11.5,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41uv%2BvFDlpL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 30787},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Car Accessories', 'Car Cradles & Mounts', 'Car Mounts'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories', 'Computer Components']]"

If you already have a car charger with the micro usb connection, the car dock has the connection in the back so that you can now insert the charging usb connection into the USB connection on the dock. When you slide the DX into the dock, it will automatically start charging. I like that feature.The fit of the DX into the dock is excellent IMO. You slide the phone down into the cradle and on top there is a latch that closes down on the top of the phone to keep it snugly in place. When you are ready to pull out the phone, you just push the latch up and pull out the phone. Very easy.The arm is perfect for my car. It is very short and very functional as far as being able to situate it the way you want it in your car. If you have a large car or the area where you plan to mount the dock is going to be more than 4 or so inches from where you plan to use your phone, this setup may be too short for you. Also, I like that the arm is short, which minimizes arm vibrations and shaking. I had a different set up a few months ago with a longer arm mount and it would allow the phone to shake too much when driving.The package came with a mounting disc, as well as an aux cable. The cable is a rubbery flexible cord. Much better than your standard plastic insulated aux cables. The dock also has a fitter in the back that allows you to always have the aux cable securely connected to the dock so you don't lose track of it whenever you plug/unplug the aux cable from your device. Nice touch.Although I do like this mounting dock, I do think it's a bit pricey. But when it comes to have an exact fit for the Droid X, I was willing to pay the extra $.I always keep my dock suctioned to the disc, never taking it out. It has been up for about 2.5 months and has never fell down or off the disc.All in all, I would definitely recommend this dock to Droid X owners.

All told, this is a GREAT product!  Well build, it's very sturdy and lower profile than I thought it would be in my relatively small windshield.  The arm extends further than it looks and the angle of the phone is adjustable, making it really easy to see.  I love that it is permanently connected to power when in the dock.

It does come with an adaptor to connect the headphone jack of the phone to the stereo, which it doesn't mention on the box, but it didn't do me any good because my stereo doesn't have a jack.  I, however, use an FM transmitter for my music and that works quite well for me.The only reason I didn't give the dock a 5 star review is that I'm disappointed that what is seen when music is playing isn't customizable.

B0042L47PW,A2OKRGHIYTBQ6P,"Lewis A. Edge Jr. ""Happy Traveler""","[2, 2]","After seeing how well a similar mount for my Droid X worked, my wife wanted me to order one for her Droid 2. Since many vehicle dashboards, including hers, have a textured surface, Motorola supplies a self-adhesive disk that will accommodate the car mount even on textured surfaces, but our best results came from sticking the suction cup directly to her car's windshield. Such an arrangement places the phone's screen at an ideal distance for my wife to see it clearly without having to take her eyes off of the road. It also makes it easy for us to switch the mount to another car if necessary, while leaving no evidence of the previous installation. Dropping the phone into the mount causes the phone to display a different screen, appropriate for vehicle use, that can be customized. If the phone rings, while in the mount, just touch the ""Answer"" button to use the phone hands-free.The rapid charger cable plugs into the back of the car mount and the phone connects with a plug mounted inside the cradle. Since this mount gives a glove-like fit to the phone, it won't work if the phone is in a protective case or has a thicker, high-capacity battery installed. However, since the plugged-in car mount supplies power to the phone while it's guiding you to your destination and the car mount provides solid protection for the phone as well, neither of those other two accessories will be necessary until you remove your phone from the mount.Overall my wife has been pleased with this purchase, which works for her as well as my similar Droid X car mount works for me.

I literally had it sitting in my cup holder on my tube with just the speaker out of the water so we could still have music. I threw it in my pocket and walked thru the river, with it continuously submerged in the water for minutes at a time. I can't believe it survived!! Still works flawlessly.

So pulling this out of my purse and and adding a couple hours of power to my phone is definitely a nice thing to be able to do, but then again having your phone go dead and disconnecting yourself has its advantages too.If you are constantly finding yourself running low on power whether it be a phone, camera or other electronic device; then this may be helpful.

As it was charging, the power pack has four indicator lights that will blink and will stay lit as it increases in charge until it reaches full capacity of 4 indicator lights, which is an added convenience, letting the user know how much reserve power will be on hand for a charge.I ran a couple of tests with some portable devices I had available, here is a list of the results:-- iPhone 4: Start of charge had a 22% battery, P793 was able to charge it up to 74% before the P793 ran out of power.-- iPhone 3GS: Will charge and charges much quicker than the iPhone 4.Edited 4/29/2011:-- iPad 1st Gen: Will charge, even though battery indicator reads ""Not Charging."" Thanks to Snap, Crackle and Pop, also a reviewer of this product, on the tip to check out if the battery % goes up after being plug in for a period of time.-- iPod Touch 2nd Gen: Will charge but only if the battery is not completely depleted. I found that since the battery was completely depleted, I had to use the my normal means of charging the iPod to get it past dead before the P793 would charge it. This bears to note that this may be the case with other portable devices.-- Sony Reader PRS-505: Will NOT charge.-- Kindle 3G + Wi-Fi: Will charge with attached microUSB.-- Version Wireless MIFI2200: Will charge with attached microUSB.I can see the P793 coming in handy while traveling and for every day use with it's convenience factor of not needing so many charging cords to be carried around, even though I was disappointed it wouldn't charge the iPad. Also an added plus is that you can charge the P793 AND charge two attached devices at the same time via the USB and microUSB charging connectors. But I recommend that you try your portable device with the P793 beforehand, to be sure that it will charge your portable device.",4.0,1303948800,"04 28, 2011",Motorola Universal Dual-Charging Portable Power Pack - Black - Retail Packaging,15.59,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41z8NseAyIL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 12864},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Travel Chargers'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Batteries, Chargers & Accessories', 'Power Strips']]"

The first few times I charged it up and dropped it in my purse for charging emergencies, it had drained before I needed it -- approximately one week from charge.The first time I had a fully drained phone and a full charger (one day old charge), I hooked up the charger using the blue cord, which is tucked into the side of it.  My phone said the battery was charging.  All four lights were on the Motorola charger.*When I went back twenty minutes later, it told me to connect my phone to a charger.  It is.) At this point the charger has 3 lights and one blinking.* Two hours later, my phone is charged to 18%. I hadn't made any phone calls or connected to the internet, so there was no reason for it not to have filled up more than that during that time.  The charger has 2 lights and 1 blinking.*After three hours of charging, my phone is at 53%, and the charger is down to 1 light and 1 blinking light.*After 3 hours and 15 minutes, my phone is at 59% charge and one blinking light is all of what's left in the charger.*At 3 hours and 30 minutes, my phone is charged to 69% and the charger is still blinking one light.  Three minutes later, my phone is at 70% and the charger is empty.I don't know how to account for 18% charging in two hours and twenty minutes compared to the 51% further charge after another one hour and 33 minutes.  I would say that it is just the phone but I know that I can plug it into the wall for 20 minutes and it will say 75% charge.I've only been using this for emergency charging and I haven't had trouble with it used that way, even though it did not fill up my phone charge.The problem is if you are going to be without reliable electricity and need this to provide a full charge.  I like charging devices on the boat, especially when we are anchoring out or sailing a lot because we may not turn on the engine for several days.There's a lot to like about this charger, as well.  It's very lightweight and slim.  If you look at it sideways, it looks a little like Kate Middleton.)

I've tried it on an iPhone 3G, iPhone 4, Moto BT earpiece, and a couple of older generation iPod Nanos and it has done a good job on all the devices.  I fully charged it and have had it in my bag for a couple of weeks without touching it and when I turn it on it looks like it has held pretty much all of its charge.It can accommodate a standard USB plug and has a micro USB plug built in to it.  Note, there is NOT a MINI USB connection built in.  To charge something that uses a mini USB you have to have an additional wire that goes from standard USB to mini USB.  I personally don't have anything that can be charged via micro USB and several things that can be charged via mini USB so I would have liked to see an integrated mini USB line included.  I'm guessing all newer Moto stuff uses micro USB.  Minus a quarter of a star for not showing the mini USB any love...It is a very nice size being just smaller and just as thick as an iPhone 4.  Very light weight.  To charge the unit itself a dedicated micro USB port is provided.  It can charge via the included wall plug to micro USB or standard USB (from your computer) to micro USB.  If you feel like you might need to charge it while out you need to carry an additional plug or cable.  I think it would have been nice if they could have integrated a flip out standard USB plug for charging.  Or made a mini USB port available for charging so that you could use the same standard USB to mini USB cable you would likely carry around anyway.  In either case you could eliminate the need to carry a cord around just for charging.  Again, minus a quarter of a star...  Rounding keeps this thing with a 5 star rating.Overall, a nice and handy thing to have for those times you head out for dinner or drinks after work and find your smart phone giving you the ""low battery"" warning.

That's where I would recommend this universal power pack.It's slightly smaller than my Blackberry Pearl, weighs about 2 oz, fairly portable (though not as small as a spare battery). It seems to charge up fast (a couple hours) and will charge up any small device that accepts micro or standard USB. Brilliant idea, actually, but not perfect. It will charges my Blackberry from 10% to about 80%, which will last me 3-5 days with moderate use. And it charges my small Archos tablet (it's about 1/2 the size of an ipad) from 10% to about 60%, which will also last me a couple of days.However, keep in mind, the power pack won't bring back my tablet if it's completely dead. Also keep in mind, you'll still need to have access to a car or wall outlet to recharge your power pack. So again, if you just have one device to keep track of, just keeping a spare adapter & spare battery in your car, purse, or suitcase is probably more effective than keeping track of a brand new, larger, & more expensive device.I gave this device a full charge & just keep it in the glove box for travel.

After a few hours, we went to test it out.  The phone (Samsung Epic 4g Touch) paired perfectly.  However, the FM transmitter functionality was completely non-working.  I called the support number, and the support representative dutifully ran down her checklist ... nothing worked.  I was told to bring it back to the store for exchange.A few days later, I exchanged the device, and the replacement unit appeared to work fine.  Call quality was good, and the FM functionality worked well for routing call and music audio to the car stereo.  The auto-search feature for finding empty stations isn't very good.  Very often I'd tune to the directed station, and find my signal being stepped on by an existing broadcast.  After a bit of fiddling, you'll eventually find a clear channel.  When that happens audio quality is pretty good.  My wife used the device for the better part of the week, and for the most-part it worked just fine.  ...but then it started acting up.  It would be slow to ""wake up"" and pair every now and then.  And then today ... it just wouldn't wake up despite having a full charge.  Even flipping the power switch on-and-off had no effect.  It had worked perfectly just a few hours before ... and then nothing.So ... I called customer support Sunday, Jan 6 sometime after 6:30PM EST.  The representative had me try a few trouble-shooting steps, but then agreed that I had (yet another) defective unit and we started putting together an RMA.  He took some very basic information from me, and then put me on hold.  After about 5-minutes on hold, he comes back and tells me they're ""having trouble with their systems"" and asked if he could ""call back in 5 minutes.""  I made sure he had my phone number correct, hung up and went about my business.  At about 7:10pm EST, I realized I had never received my call-back, so I called in myself ... only to be greeted by a recording stating that they were now closed for the night.  I guess Mr. Indian Accent didn't want to deal with my RMA so close to quitting time, so he just blew me off.

(MotoSpeak must be downloaded for this feature, but that is readily available via the Droid Marketplace) Overall, I am pleased with the unit itself.What I am not pleased with is the documentation that came with it. According to the printed material, the Roadster should respond to incoming calls with the name of the caller, provided that the caller is in your contact list. That does not happen; instead, it announces the phone number, not the name, just as other reviewers had noted.Additionally, nothing in the printed instructions talks about recognized commands or options, yet there is a specific list of commands that the Roadster recognizes. I accidentally discovered these one afternoon when I turned the Roadster on while my Droid 2 was lying on the desk face up. Suddenly a list of commands and options that I did not know existed appeared on the display screen of my phone. Since then, I have taken the step to remove my Droid 2 from my belt and place it with the screen facing me while in the car; in this way, I can see both who is calling and what commands are available.Would I recommend it to friends?

I use it primarily for streaming Pandora and having conference calls over my car's stereo.  The battery usually lasts about two weeks.  Finding the perfect station takes a couple days.

B004877KOK,A1B4MIXYVIKMU2,,"[1, 3]","I've owned many in-car Blue-tooth Speaker-Phone systems and I have to say that I'm very impressed with this Motorola Roadster Blue-tooth system.  It was very well designed and works well with my iPhone 4G. In fact, I find it very difficult to find something bad to say about it.  The only minor complaint I have is that when it syncs/pairs with my iPhone, it tells me the battery level of my iPhone instead of the battery level of the unit itself. I'm usually aware of what the battery level of my phone is, so it's redundant... and I'd much rather know what the battery level of the speaker-phone is.  This is a very minor issue and I am impressed that it DOES display the battery level of the speaker-phone on my iphone screen when it is synced/paired. Other than that, this thing is great and I still give it 5-Stars.Here are some of the reasons why I thought this speaker-system deserves 5 Stars:-Easy to use-Charges through standard USB to mini-USB cable.-Syncs very easily and consistently... and speaks to you to let you know it's synced. Voice is easy to understand.-It seems to sense when you are in your car and syncs accordingly even though the Blue-tooth range is much greater.-Two options to listen to phone calls/music (through the on-board speaker or a radio channel of your choice through car speakers)-unit is small, the buttons are backlit, and the clip stays clipped to the sunshade very well... it's sturdy.-Long battery life and long standby time. I've had the unit sitting in my car for about two weeks and haven't needed to charge it again yet.-Voice quality is good over speaker-phone speakers.-Comes with Car charger & Cable... plus, frustration free packaging.Conclusion:If you're looking for a great hands-free blue-tooth in-car speaker-phone that does the job and you're willing to spend a little more for the quality, this is the one for you.

Although I've been regularly using aPlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth headset/mikefor two years, other household members have been slower to adopt the hands-free habit. This was due to both inconsistent pairing of the Plantronics with our phones, and perhaps vanity over the nerdiness of the over-the-ear headset/mike.The Roadster solved both those issues. Since we've had it, we've upgraded our cell phones. The Roadster recognized and quickly paired with our older two LG phones and, after upgrading, with the two new HTC EVO phones without issue. Incoming call quality through its integrated speaker is perfectly acceptable, as is the quality of our outgoing speech.I also exercised the functionality of the FM transmitter, to route call audio through the car's radio. We live in a area where the FM bands are relatively crowded with signals from multiple large cities, and this seemed to sometimes confuse the Roadster, just as it sometimes confuses the car radio too!Unless you have a smart phone and are interested in streaming music services (such as Pandora or Rhapsody), I don't consider this a serious drawback.

Each person I spoke with said they could tell I was on speakerphone, and there was obvious background noise that was tolerable. I was frequently asked to repeat myself several times during every conversations, though. And, as much as I was asked to repeat myself, I think I had more difficulty hearing people on my end. The speaker on the Roadster was not the best for phone calls as voices sounded muffled. Audio quality was better when I used FM to transmit through my car speakers, but there was some interference now and then which resulted in me changing the station a few times.I listened to some youtube videos, a bit of an audiobook, and I played a few songs from Pandora - it all sounded fine through the Roadster itself and even better through FM. There wasn't much bass on the Roadster, though, and audio was a little tinny but still comfortable to listen to through its tiny speaker.The buttons felt a little soft and mushy. It was frequently hard to tell if I'd actually pressed one hard enough to prompt a response. The icons on the buttons are raised for better distinction so you don't have to take your eyes off the road to know what you are pressing so that is helpful.One of the selling points of this speakerphone for me was being able to use the Motospeak app, which actually works with other non-Motorola bluetooth speakerphones as well. Well, I found that using Motospeak was mostly useless. It only understood me about half the time I spoke messages, and I discovered that I actually find it more annoying than helpful having text messages announced when they arrive. It's rather frustrating when you're trying to talk to another passenger in the car or place an order at a drive-thru and the automated voice interrupts with her big text announcement. I gave it a shot, but that app is not something I'm interested in anymore. I'll just check my texts at red lights or when I'm not driving.Can't say anything about battery life as I didn't keep the Roadster long enough to need to charge it again. I returned it for something that functions with better clarity on calls and hardly any interference on FM aka theMotorola T505 Bluetooth Portable In-Car Speakerphone, which I highly recommend.

B004877KOK,A13MKSASQ6YWL7,B. Willis,"[540, 557]","I own the newer Motorola Roadster and the slightly older Motorola T505.  So it made sense to do a head-to-head comparison to see which unit is better.Design: Both units are compact.  The Roadster's layout is somewhat more appealing to my eye.  The Roadster's controls are labeled and easy to find.  They are also illuminated.  The T505's controls are not as well labeled or illuminated, but it is easy to use nonetheless.The T505 has a reversible mounting clip, so it can work with cars like my Audi, which have sun visors that swing from front-to-rear rather than the usual rear-to-front.  Roadster's mounting clip is not reversible, so I must mount it backwards in order to use it.  Once the unit is mounted backwards, throw those easy-to-read labels and icons out the window.  The T505 is made from plastic.  So is the Roadster, but it also is partially covered by a nylon or poly cloth material that could prove to be less durable.  While the Roadster features a more updated look, the lack of a reversible mounting clip gives a slight advantage to the T505, as the Roadster is hard to use when mounted backward.Pairing.  Both bluetooth units pair very easily, but the advantage goes to the Roadster, which announces that it is ready to pair and then does so quickly.  Things couldn't be much easier then that.  But the T505 is also easy to pair, just not quite as easy as Roadster.  Also, the Roadster turns itself on when you enter the car, which is nice.  The T505 must be turned on manually.I paired both units with a newer Palm Pixi Plus and a slightly older Palm Treo 755p.  While Roadster initially paired with this somewhat older 755p, after a couple of days it would no longer pair.  I tried everything I could think of and got to pair eventually, but it later developed the same problem, dropping pairing and then refusing to pair.  The T-505 paired and remained connected without issues.  While the Roadster pairs easier than the T505, I had no issues with the T505 and I had several problems with Roadster's pairing.  Advantage: T505.Streaming Music:  Both units can stream MP3s from your cell phone through your car stereo.  When advancing from one track to the next, Roadster required me to hold down the advance button for much longer than I'd like to, creating a distraction while driving.  A single touch on that key pauses the music but it must be held down for awhile to advance the track.  I had to hold the button down to the point where it was annoying.  Also, the advance takes longer than I'd like and is accompanied by a very loud beep and then a clicking sound.  Also, with Roadster, I cannot revert to the previously played track.  With the T505, I simply click on the right side button to advance and the left side button to go back.  Changes from track to track only require a short touch, the change is immediate and it is not accompanied by the obnoxious beep tone or clicking noise.  Advantage T505.Speakerphone: The Roadster's built in speakerphone is louder and clearer than the T505's.  If you are using the speakerphone and not streaming to FM stereo, the advantage goes to the Roadster.Output to FM stereo: Both units have similar output strength to FM.  It could be better but both units are much better than a Jabra unit that I tested earlier.  I'd consider the output to FM on both units to be on the better side of acceptable.  Roadster can select a specific FM frequency that you'd like for the unit to broadcast on each time.  The T505 cannot do this.  T505 will automatically scan for a frequency and you can select a preferred frequency, but it will generally select whatever it likes.  I'd probably call this a draw, although I do prefer Roadster's frequency-selecting ability.Call quality: I spoke with my mother on the Roadster first and then with the T505.  I was driving a convertible with the top up.  The car is not noisy but is slightly more so than a hardtop vehicle.  The Roadster's microphone was so sensitive that it was picking up much of the background noise and forcing the duplex to me even when I wasn't speaking.  That meant that I couldn't hear much of what mom said because Roadster picked up the road noise and shut off mom's conversation.  The T505 didn't have this problem.  Big advantage T505.Incoming calls: When an incoming call arrives, both units announce the caller's name and number, if available.  Roadster allows you to say ""answer"" or ""ignore"".  With the T505, you simply tap the telephone icon to answer.  Slight advantage Roadster.Texting: It's my understanding that Roadster can read back texts and allow you to reply to them.  I did not test this function, but assuming it works properly, it seems like that would be an attractive feature for someone who texts a lot.  Advantage Roadster.The Winner: Of the two units, I prefer the T505.  It's less fussy than Roadster.  While Roadster's pairing failed several times, the T505 was always rock solid.  Music streaming track advances were much quicker and smoother on the T505.  The microphone was way too sensitive on Roadster, although this might not be a problem for those with a very quiet car.Both are decent units, but I'm using the T505 daily while Roadster sits in its box.  Roadster isn't bad, but I can't give it more than 3 stars based on my experiences.",3.0,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",Motorola Roadster Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone - Retail Packaging,59.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41fj0xFYPiL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3517},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Car Accessories', 'Car Kits']]"

B004877KOK,A3JUHP1E3WUHEA,Dr. Stuart Gitlow,"[39, 45]","The Roadster is a lightweight unit roughly the size of a cellphone but molded to fit properly on an automobile sun visor. It comes with a car recharger and small instructional booklet. I unpacked mine and turned it on. It immediately ""spoke"" through the built-in speaker, indicating that its battery level was low and that it needed to be connected via Bluetooth to my cellphone. I have an iPhone 4; I turned that on and selected the Settings app so that I could set up the Bluetooth connection. Following the instructions I'd just heard on the Roadster, I accomplished that within a few seconds. The Roadster then indicated that it was connected to my iPhone, using my iPhone's personal name through the speaker.The next day, I put the Roadster in my car, plugging it into the lighter socket to recharge the battery. A blue LED on the lighter plug indicates that power is being received and the unit announces that it is being charged. A little while later, I received a phone call. The ring tone that I'd normally hear on my phone came through on the Roadster's speaker and I was quickly able to answer the call. While driving on the highway with some interior noise in the car, the unit had excellent clarity and my caller indicated that he had no trouble understanding the conversation.While I can send the Roadster's speaker output to the FM radio band instead, I rarely have the radio on and so have not used that function.I left the car at the airport, leaving the Roadster turned on and unplugging the lighter plug, and taking my iPhone with me. Four days later, returning to the car, as I opened the door I heard the Roadster announce that it had detected my iPhone and was setting up the Bluetooth connection. This required no action on my part. Battery level was announced as being high, so clearly the unit had turned off appropriately during my and my phone's absence. I initiated a call this time and the input/output was automatically directed to the Roadster's mic/speaker setup without any additional action on my part.As you've read in other reviews, the Roadster has other capabilities, such as streaming music, voice response to certain commands, and so forth. I haven't utilized these capabilities yet, but the strength of this product is in the straightforward and easy setup, the clarity of the speaker and microphone, and the ease and speed with which it links to the Bluetooth connection of my phone each time I return to the car. I've observed no errors or problems in this regard over the first 10 days of use and am looking forward to a long relationship between my phone and the Roadster.",5.0,1296345600,"01 30, 2011",Motorola Roadster Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone - Retail Packaging,59.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41fj0xFYPiL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3517},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Car Accessories', 'Car Kits']]"

B004877KOK,A21AXG1NOGURX0,Greg,"[3, 3]","Pros:- Very loud - almost painfully loud at times. Most phones go into compression while this speakerphone will play, for example, an alert at real volume (which is usually full volume). This makes it possible to actually use this phone while driving down the highway.- Good noise cancellation - people I've talked to say they can understand me just fine.- Amazing battery life - I used this for two weeks straight in the car without recharging. I was using it to listen to podcasts, so it was actually active for ~2 hours a day. In the age of nightly recharges this is amazing.Cons:- FM Transmitter is a little weak - might be my car (Camry), but while operating in FM transmitter mode, it is not noise free.- Auto Sleep - I was hoping to use this unit as a speakerphone in conference rooms, but unfortunately, if not moved around (natural vibration of the car etc), the unit will sleep after a certain amount of time. This seems like an odd quirk to go into sleep mode during a call, but it's happened several times. Along these same lines, the unit is much more sensitive in one axis than the other (read facing the phone button). This is great for road noise cancellation, but it does make less useful as a speakerphone on a table.Conclusion:Overall a very effective unit for what it's intended for.

B004877KOK,A174X7S1J75AZ3,Jamie Hamel-Smith,"[0, 0]","I use this for listening to podcasts on my commute, and the phone call functionality as well.It pairs reliably and never drops the audio like some Bluetooth devices can. The volume is ample, and the FM transmitter feature works well too.One of the best features of this speakerphone is the way it powers on and off. There's a hard (slider-style) on and off switch but when it has been on for a while with no activity, it shuts itself off. The great thing is that it senses when you enter the car (usually when you shut the door or begin moving) and powers on. This means that the batter can last for over two weeks with heavy use, and you never have to worry about forgetting it on, or manually turning it on when you get in the car.The Motorola app that is suggested is buggy, and works just OK. It's not required to use the device.You can answer calls by speaking. When a call comes in, it will announce who is calling and ask you if you want to 'answer' or 'ignore'. This voice recognition works very well, and has never failed me. It also has a button to initiate your phone's voice command dialer, and another button to answer or hang up.For listening to podcasts, there is a play/pause toggle that will skip to the next track if held down. This is brilliant for running errands and jumping in and out of the car as you never have to reach into your pocket/purse for the device. Just play/pause from the speakerphone itself.If a podcast is playing, and a call comes in the audio is paused. When the other party hangs up, the device resumes your music/podcast.The current price at the time of this review makes this an even better value.

B004877KOK,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[388, 401]","Before getting this I did quite a bit of searching on the web, and couldn't find anything that explains exactly how well this speakerphone works with iPhones.  Several other reviews outline its main features, and a few mention that they use it with their iPhones but don't discuss the limitations of that mode, so what follows is intended just for those who hope to use it with an iPhone.  (I've got the iPhone 3G, but I can't see any reason it would work differently with the iPhone 3GS or 4).It's clearly designed for droid phones, and on those phones you can download the MotoSpeak app and have it read texts out loud - and even allows you to compose texts hands free.  Still, the basic and most essential functions appear to work with any Bluetooth enabled phone, and certainly with my iPhone 3G.It hooks easily to the sun visor of the car, and the charger plugs into the cigarette lighter.  It links easily with the iPhone, once you go into the settings and enable Bluetooth.  After it's linked, the Roadster recognizes your phone, and turns itself on automatically, apparently triggered by the sound of an opening or closing car door.  Once on, it speaks out loud that it recognizes your phone, and even says the name of the phone it's linked to.  It also tells you whether it's fully charged or not.If you receive a call, it tells you there's an incoming call and if your phone recognizes the caller it tells you who's calling.  You can then say either ""Answer"" or ""Ignore"" and it will either pick up the call or drop it.  You hear the call either through a speaker built in to the Roadster or you can set it up so it transmits directly to your car stereo through an unused FM frequency.  The onboard microphone picks up your voice - all you have to do is speak at an ordinary level and it works fine.  My wife reported that it sounds just like it does when I'm calling her directly through the iPhone.Pressing the call icon on the Roadster will redial your most recent call.  Another feature built in to it is that you're supposed to be able to click on the dial tone button and speak a phone number - but when I press that button the Roadster tells me that the feature is unsupported by my phone.  It strikes me a bit odd that the Roadster can control my iPhone enough to dial the most recent call, but not to dial a different number, but that's the way it is.You can also play music from your phone through the Roadster - it sounds awful if you try to do it through the speaker on the Roadster, but when you've got it on the FM transmitting mode, and assuming you've got it set on a clear station the music sounds pretty decent, about as good as you'd get it from a decent but not perfect signal on a regular FM station. In my case I hook the iPhone directly to my stereo with a USB cable, so I wouldn't ever bother with this.So what this is really useful for on my iPhone is answering calls hands free - and in my case that's the main thing I wanted it for so it works pretty well for me.  If you want to make phone calls a lot while driving, or want to receive and send text with voice commands, you'll need a different kind of phone, with Android 2.2 or higher.  Having said that, those features would make this an excellent device for owners of Android phones; the more basic features still make it quite useful for iPhone users like me.",4.0,1298160000,"02 20, 2011",Motorola Roadster Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone - Retail Packaging,59.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41fj0xFYPiL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3517},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Car Accessories', 'Car Kits']]"

Just turn it on, it will tell you its in pair mode, and then tell your phone to scan for bluetooth devices, pair it, and done.  The built in speaker is clear and loud enough to overcome road noise with the window(driver side) partially rolled down.  To go to fm mode, just press the fm button and use the volume buttons to scan for an open frequency.  Quality across the radio in a large city has some static, as there are not very many open frequencies, but this is try of all OEM fm transmitters, they aren't allowed to transmit with a lot of power so there is often bleed-over from another frequency.

They performed great until I tried to use the FM radio feature which was virtually worthless on both units.  I could barely hear the unit over the FM radio and yes, I even tried a different car and my home FM radio.  The problem is definitely in the Roadster.  If I touched the wire visor clip while broadcasting FM and aimed the visor downward so it was parallel with my radio antenna the performace would improve somewhat.  This tells me that there is an antenna and/or FM power problem with this unit.The reason I purchased the Roadster was because I sold my older Motorola T505 to an employee who needed one right away.  I decided to upgrade since I now have an Android smartphone and this unit supposedly has text to speech and speech to text capability. By the way the text to speech was minimally useful and the speech to text wouldn't work on my phone.After trying a Jabra Cruiser as well, which also failed miserably in the FM department I decided to go back to the T505 which arrived today.

Infact I am using a Evo 4G and I actually have to lower the speaker volume cause its so loud, so thats a plus. Another reason I lowered the volume was that at high it does tend to give out unwanted vibration and its annoying. The text to speech is so far a hit and miss, its 50% right and about 50% wrong but I think it has to do more with the app from Android than the product itself so Moto has to update that app and from what I can see many people feel the same way as lately the ratings have crashed. That said I am very pleased with the Moto so far and now have to see if with updates and fine tunning the BT gets not so much better but more relaible. My second concern is life span as I have ready some reviews that within a few months the thing dies so hope those were just bad batches. Other features I love is the auto off/on feature that way I won't be the one doing that because I would forget most of the time and bettery life would go out the window. This thing also has media play so you can listen to Pandora or other stuff through it as well as the radio feature to listen through your car speakers. I have not tried those nor do I plan to as I just wanted a BT that works I have all those other features built into my stereo already. Last but not least another great feature I love about this BT unit is voice recognition as when a call or text comes in all I have to do is say answer or read and its cool. To end I would have given this thing a 5 star but issues with the text to speech and speech to text (which is one of the reasons I bought it) I had to lower until they fix or make more reliable.",4.0,1318032000,"10 8, 2011",Motorola Roadster Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone - Retail Packaging,59.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41fj0xFYPiL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3517},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Car Accessories', 'Car Kits']]"

The button are back lighted and big enough, and the sound quality is good (both speaker and the mic due to dual-microphone noise cancellation technology). The auto-off feature is convenient and battery last a long time. The sound is loud enough even in a noisy car (or window open).Make sure your phone/device is compatible before buying this speakerphone.Pros:1. Good speaker sound quality (mic quality is also good)2. Very easy to operate (easy to pair up, and buttons are back lighted with LED)3. Pair up with multiple devices (not at the same time however)4. Auto-off (and auto-on) and safe battery life (good battery life)5. Solid build and compact6. FM frequency can be customized (vs just a few pre-set frequency)7. Read message pretty good (the text to speech function)Cons:1. Power LED is small and on the side (hard to see)2. On FM transmitter mode, the volume button become radio frequency tuning, and no way to change volume from the speakerphone3.

The sound quality is great and it is easy to set-up and use. It was touchy at first, but once it's paired it'll stay paired: my problem was with ""naming it"" in my phone's bluetooth device name space. You can write anything there and it'll say whatever you type, such as, ""Connected to MJ007"" or whatever you care to name it. Buy it!!!----------------------After using this for 2 months... ca-ca! Pure poop! Here's the pain: every time the battery goes low (this is the 2nd time) and it get recharged, IT LOSES ALL THE PAIRING INFORMATION, and one has to re-pair it again, but it's not easy because it DOES NOT WANT TO PAIR AGAIN!! I am not a techno-idiot, but this thing will make you feel like an idiot because it does not follow basic configuration standards. Stay away. And the problem arose after my 30-day warrenty expired. If I can I'm returning this.---------------------------My 4-year old Jabra SP700 would not pair with my latest phone, so I had to seek another speakerphone for my car, and bumped into this one here on The Zon. From its feel to its function this unit is fine. I say perhaps too good because it pairs with my phone from a long distance, say 200 ft. I left my phone in the house once and went to move the car and while in the car, in the street, it connected to my phone 25-yards away in the house! This is stuff from spy novels. The speakerphone has great clarity and all of the voice activated functions work like a charm. I don't have blue tooth radio but if I did this unit can act as a remote FM speaker too. The Motorola insignia on the face shines like a light at night, so in order to camophlage the remote clipped onto my visor, I took a black marker and blackened all of the shiny areas: out of sight, out of mind. After a month's worth of use I highly recommended this unit for hands-free talking.

B004877KOK,A20VG5W98SX99L,"Y. Kim ""Zelium""","[30, 35]","You might already know that the Motorola Roadster is a bluetooth hands-free device for your cell phone. A product like this is not so new to us.  However, I would like like to emphasize that the specialty of the Roadster compared to other bluetooth speakerphones.  I love the Roadster for its special features.If you want to use the Roadster as a traditional bluetooth speakerphone, the Roadster is a pretty good one.  My wife has never used an in-car speakerphone like this, and she loves the clarity of the sound and the convenience of the Roadster.  I have more than several bluetooth headsets now (probably 5 or 6), and my wife never used any of them, due to the poor sound quality and the hassle she had to go through to use the headsets.  The Roadster was installed on the visor in her car and did the work it was designed to do without bothering my wife, so she had no reason to hate it.  Once my wife closes the car door to drive out, the little shock made by the door wakes the Roadster up and automatically pairs itself to her cell phone.  When there is a call, the Roadster says the name of the caller if the name is in the address book or reads a phone number if there is no entry in the address book of the paired phone.  And by saying ""Answer"" or ""Ignore"", the call is connected or not.  The voice recognition worked pretty well.  What a convenient feature for my wife who does not like to operate electronic devices in the car.What I liked most about the Roadster is that it transmits all the sounds from your phone to the FM radio in your car.  I have a smart phone (Samsung Galaxy S) and frequently listen to internet radio.  And I do not have any auxilary audio inputs in my Prius. The Roadster serves as a great bluetooth-to-FM transmitter.  I would not say the quality of the sound is top-notch, however, the clarity was pretty good.  I have been using a FM transmitter from Monster Cable that got great reviews here on Amazon, however, I prefer the Roadster for its signal strength.The added benefit of the Roadster is that everything is voice-guided.  Even if you have never paired a cell phone with a bluetooth device before, you can follow the voice directions which are very clear and loud.  You should be warned that sometimes the passengers are surprised by the greeting sound of the Roadster when you get in your car with them.  Once you get in the car, the Roadster wakes up and tells you the connection status and the battery level and this might surprise your guests.Selecting FM frequency for the sound transmission is easy and straightforward.  You can change the FM frequency by increments of 0.2MHz manually or the Roadster can automatically find the best frequency for you if you push a scan/seek button.  And the voice tells you which frequency was set for the Roadster and the radio.  The battery life is pretty decent. I charge it only once a week.  If you attach the Roaster on a visor like me, then you should take the Roadster out for a charge, since the length of the included car charger is too short.The one thing that I am still not sure is the battery status that is told by the Roadster.  I thought that it was the battery level of the Roadster, however, it might be the battery level of your phone.  I tested several times and am still not sure which one is right. Sometimes the Roadster says the battery level is low right after a full charge and my cell phone's battery level happened to be low.  That's why I suspect that the Roadster was telling me the battery level of my phone connected to it.Overall, the Roadster is a great motion-sensing bluetooth-to-FM transmitter, and I absolutely love it.  I might buy one more for my other car pretty soon.",5.0,1297814400,"02 16, 2011",Motorola Roadster Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone - Retail Packaging,59.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41fj0xFYPiL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3517},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Car Accessories', 'Car Kits']]"

From my experience, this is generally true for most of the batteries out there.  These came brand new from what I could tell.  I examined the connectors and they did not have the polished look to them, which is what you get when you plug in batteries into the phone because the connections rub against each other when the battery is slid in.

First the battery is ridiculously large but i could deal with that because the battery lasted a long time compared to the standard, I even let it charge for overnight like some ppl said to avoid issues.Cons: The door was almost impossible to get on because it didn't quite fit so had to force it with alot of pressure.  It literally reboots several times a day which at first I was ok with because if you were careful picking it up or sitting it down it wouldn't reboot.  Now after 3 months it reboots 5 or more times every single day and I just cant take it anymore.  It reboots because the battery doesn't fit snugly and the door doesn't help in that department so then the connectors between the phone and the battery loses connection if their is any movement.  Because the battery is not a snug fit the connectors can disconnect at anytime and the phone will not turn back on, you have to open the door then push it back in with extreme force then the phone will turn back on.  I don't recommend this phone unless you don't mind it turning off when you put it in your pocket or purse or case or even when you take it out.  I'll be in the middle of a call and it just turns off, extremely annoying.

It also has a button on the side for activation and deactivation (off-hook and on-hook).  It is the silver button with the M symbol on it.I have had no complaints from anyone that they cannot hear me.  I also think that they can only hear my voice, and not background noise.

B004CU1VW0,A1D57TSKTBBBJN,Camera Shy,"[114, 117]","I have had many bluetooth headsets and have preferred the Motorola H series flip boom because it is a simple-to-use on/off switch.  The H730 has some nice features over its predecessors including:- Ability to pair with up to two phones simultaneously.  If you have two phones like I do (personal and work supplied), the H730 does an excellent job of pairing both phones and allowing communication switching between the two including voice dial.- Voice Status.  The H730 provides voice status on battery level as well as phone connection; well done.- Voice Quality. I've never understood why Bluetooth voice quality has never been great, but, the H730 is as good as I've experienced with a bluetooth headset.  No complaints from callers on the other end.- Battery Life.  Very good as I have come to expect from the past H series devices.  I have not completely drained the H730 nor received any battery warnings even after talking well over an hour.Room for Improvement- Once feature I miss from the older H series units is a color coded LED battery strength signal (green, yellow, and red).  I have not experienced a low battery status, so the unit may provide a visual low battery signal and I'm unaware of it.All in all, this is an excellent device and comes recommended based on my experience with many bluetooth headsets.UPDATE: After a few years of experience with the H730, my opinion remains that it's a 5 Star product.  I recently bought the newer Motorola HX550 thinking maybe it would be an upgrade; it's not.  The H730 is better in every way including:- wearing comfort,- slipping on and off the ear,- call quality for me wearing the H730,- call quality for the person I am talking to (yes, I have compared both units with multiple people on the other end; the H730 was preferred each time), and- button controls (the vol buttons are better on the HX550 but the large command button most used is superior on the H730).I have had plenty of bluetooth headsets and the H730 as of March 2013 is still the best I have tried and I have tried units that cost nearly $200.",5.0,1294963200,"01 14, 2011",Motorola H730 Bluetooth Headset,66.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41dK1ueP7vL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 956},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"

Range is easily 40 feet without obstruction.  I can go most anywhere in my house without carrying the phone around.I find the ""talking"" it does to tell you the connection state and battery level to be a bit gimmiky and somewhat irritating- especially if the phone is ringing and the headset is off and you are waiting for it to connect.

If I had to choose the best H7XX series bluetooth headset ever made by Motorola, It would have to be the H715 (they've stop making them so get them wherever you can).Why do I say this.  The voice prompt ""latency"" when connecting to your phone once a conversation has started is awful.  You have to wait for the boot up sound, then if your paired with two phones, it has to tell you the status, ""Phone 1 connected, battery level is high, Phone 2 connected."" and then a small pause and then you can finally hear the person on the other side and by then you have to ask them to repeat themselves.  I think the voice prompts are great for the H720 as it can only be pair to one phone and thus the voice prompts should be quicker but on the H730 its a mess as you can pair the headset with two phones.The other issue is non of the H7XX series have lasted more than 18 months.  I must admit that I use them hardcore 6-8 hour calls sometimes.  I've used the Motorola warranty 2 of the 3 times as one was more than 12 months.

B004LRO7N4,A34OJWGNJAOPUZ,"A. Jones ""Andy""","[0, 0]","This vehicle dock is meant to work with the Atrix 4g phone, also from Motorola.  As a dedicated accessory to a specific product, it pairs very well with the Atrix phone.The car dock comes with a small insert that allows you to use your phone with it regardless of whether or not you have a case.  Some bulky cases might prevent you from docking successfully, but small form factor ones should work without a problem.  If you have no case or cover, the insert lets your phone slip snugly into the dock.  The insert sits in the dock itself, it doesn't have to be attached to your phone.  You wouldn't even know it was there after your 1st use.The suction cup is very well designed and attached firmly to my windshield.  I've had problems in the past with docks not sticking to my window, especially in very hot or very cold conditions, but this dock holds tight and doesn't so much as wobble.  Also included is a small 'cup' for attaching this to your dashboard.  I prefer the window mount, but you can attach to your dashboard if you like.The cord included plugs into a car power adapter (also included) and into the AUX port in your vehicle.  The power adapter has 2 USB ports on it, meaning you can charge another device while this one is plugged in, a great feature.  If you do not have an aux or input in your vehicle (or stereo) you might want to review your options for getting sound from the atrix to your car, but the phone will still charge, and you can always just turn the speaker way up.  I found I had no problem hearing navigation commands or calls over the phone speaker on high volume.When the phone is plugged in it automatically launches the dedicated cardock app.  This gives you several large icons, easy to hit with one hand.  There are several default ones, and multiple pages of customizable slots where you can add any program you want.  For example, I added Pandora radio app to my front page, as well as the 'camcorder' program.The default 'my location' icon is nice in that it acts as a compass, telling you your current direction.  If you click on 'my location,' though, the interface it launches is not ideal.  I found I had better luck using the google maps 'navigation' app included with the atrix.  When that program launches it offers voice search by default, whereas the 'my location' required you to hit a tiny button in order to do voice navigation.My only complaint with this product is that there was a production run of non-functional car docks.  That is, some docks do nothing when you plug your phone into them, they're not working.  A quick internet search shows that a certain number docks shipped with some kind of defect.  I ended up with one of those units.I was able to get a replacement dock through Motorola, but the process was not as smooth as I would have liked.  At first they wanted me to factory reset my phone, losing all my data.  Next, they wanted me to pay for return shipping (and, indeed, required a credit card number before they would honor my warranty).  In the end they replaced my unit, though it took a while and many many phonecalls.I give this product 4 stars overall.  This is a great great cardock, but it's a bit expensive and Motorola customer service was more of a hassle than they should have been.",4.0,1317340800,"09 30, 2011",Motorola Vehicle Dock for Motorola ATRIX 1 4G with Rapid Car Charger - Retail Packaging,10.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41lgfwJ5-yL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 54843},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories']]"

I would almost pay full price for it, especially if my phone wasn't nearly 2 years. old.  Anyway, it was very easy to set up and works perfectly.  If you have AUX input the sound goes through your radio which is very nice.  I love using internet radio or my own music on the road.  The GPS is also pretty nice even though I have a dedicated system.  It's small and I've had no problems yet.It's also a very nice car charger with an extra USB slot to charge something else (something to consider when you factor in the price of this! a cheapo car charger costs at least 5 bucks and I've had them before and this is much better quality).  Bad things - You can't use your case.  I just use a little silicon case so it's not big deal to take if off, but if you had an otterbox or something it wouldn't be ideal to use this.  Also where the phone plugs into the dock it's a little damaged, nothing major but it does give it a few scratches.  Still a nice little system.  I really wish I would have gotten it before!ETA : I ended up freaking loving the GPS on this and how easily you can use it with the car dock.  It's google standard GPS that comes on the phone, but I love that you can use voice commands and the location just pops up and routes you where you need to go.  Yes, you can do all that without the dock, but it's a lot easier to see with the dock and the sound comes loud and clear through your car speakers.

B004LRO7N4,A377KA3DAIFX5F,"John Walshaw ""jjwatmyself""","[0, 0]","This car dock is exceptional, with one flaw explained after my rave review.  The USB connection is used for charging as well as giving you a 3.5 mm jack on the tail end to connect to your car stereo.  Doing this with one wire is ideal!  If you decide to put the dock in the top corner of your window and hide the wire around the edges, i.e. the long way, you'll find that the wire is too short and you'll have to add a USB extension cable.  For other locations the wire is the perfect length.  Once connected, the Atrix takes over your car (minus auto pilot).  The Navigation voice comes over the car stereo as well as music.  If you want to have navigation without the voice, simply turn down the volume using the rocker on the phone and your music will play uninterupted.  This is because Navigation, Music and call volume are controled independently. Another nice feature is that if you are not using a bluetooth headset and choose to make/take a call, the phone defaults to speaker phone and if you choose to turn speaker phone off during the call, it diverts to the car stereo.  A very well thought out set of features to properly integrate the phone to your car.  So why only 4 stars... as of my writing this on 4/20/11 there is an issue with charging performance in the car dock.  I'm using the OEM Motorola ECOMOTO Rapid Rate vehicle power adapter (850 mAH) with dual USB ports. You can tell this USB charger is a good product just by the weight of the thing! A test charge began at 7:45 AM and the phone's charge was 20%. At 9 AM 30% and 10:30 AM 40%. This is obviously nothing like the wall charger so it makes me believe that the phone is powered by the charger while docked plus receiving a trickle charge.  Conneting the phone directly to the USB car charger (without the car dock) using a stock USB to micro USB charging cable, at 8:00 AM the phone was at 20%, 8:20 AM 40%, 9:00 AM 70% and 10:00 AM 100%. What a contrast!! So there is an issue with charing performance while in the car dock. I'll be reporting this to Motorola and would expect them to address with a firmware update on the Atrix phone or a recall on the dock, depending how they device their solution.  You can say you read it here first as from what I know, this has not been reported on any forums yet.",4.0,1303344000,"04 21, 2011",Motorola Vehicle Dock for Motorola ATRIX 1 4G with Rapid Car Charger - Retail Packaging,10.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41lgfwJ5-yL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 54843},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories']]"

Doesn't always shift to car dock mode as it should when phone is docked (but really neat when it does, jumps right into GPS mode).

If you get another program (profile settings) you can set your phone to auto-mute when unplugged.Besides that I was amazed at the way it is integrated into driving, has a dark screen mode for night time. The buttons make for quick access to navigation, Pandora, music, calling via one press contacts buttons. I love how easy it is. With the profile program it solved my problem with auto mute. If you have it plugged into your aux stereo port you have to hit the speaker button to take it off speaker to use the car speaker system to hear the caller louder that the phone's speakerphone.The best part about buying it on Amazon is that it comes with the two port USB hub.

I called 4 different ATT retailers, no one had this in stock so I finally just called upon Amazon.This kit actually comes with a decent amount of goodies:(1) 12V DC adapter with dual USB outlets(1) male to male speaker cable with one right angle(1) USB adapter with female speaker outlet (this plugs into the dock and charger, plus has the speaker out so you don't have to mess with a second cable to the phone for audio)(1) docking station (with either suction or sticky mount)(1) docking station shim (good planning on Motorola's part here, they understand you may have this in a case, if you don't, use the shim so it doesn't wobble around)This actually works really well. I have had no issues with poor suction. The phone goes in and out nicely than any others I have seen and this is a lot cleaner looking than the after-market ones that just clamp it in. Made to fit almost makes this worth the price. I was worried that I would have to dock the phone, and then plug in the audio cable, not so!

B004LRO7N4,A2H4R3DOVF10TI,R. Oden,"[39, 41]","**Edit** Just got my Otterbox commuter (2 days early, Thanks Amazon) and unfortunately it does NOT fit in the vehicle dock. I was hoping it would be close enough so I could make some ""modifications"" but I don't think it's possible. There are port covers for the USB + HDMI when opened, need to flip backwards. My first idea was to cut those off but then I realized how much thicker the phone really was, The back of the phone gets double protection and sets the phone way to far forward for usb connections to line up. Even though this dock is built to accommodate the Atrix + case, I can only see ultra-thin cases working with this dock.I like this dock. It's easy to use, well designed, and adds some great new features to driving. Although I have never used a high-quality GPS unit, the Dock + Atrix gives me lots of new techy tools I'm not use to having in the car. The standard driving application (launched automatically when its docked) gives all the practical features you would ever want such as access to music, maps, GPS, hands-free calling, etc. You can even add/delete apps which is a great feature since I hate devices that add a lot of bloat I would never use anyways. If you search the App store there tons of great apps for driving as well such as tracking gas mileage, cheapest gas stations, repair costs, taking pictures/video, Pandora, and the great part about it is most of these apps are FREE...Back to the dock now. I use mine windshield mounted in my Subaru Outback and its sits at just the right height/angle. The included pieces which come with this dock have a great build quality as well. The included USB+ 3.5 audio input jack (yes the usb cable AND 3.5 audio jack are built into one cable which splits out at the end) are high quality and was long enough to route down the backside of my dashboard and wrap around to the cigarette lighter which means all I see is one cable disappear into a vent (actually a small opening between the defroster vent and the dash, and then re-appear next to the cigarette lighter. This dock also includes a very high quality cigarette lighter to DUAL USB adapter. This means you have an extra USB port for charging your ______. I normally stick to HTC products but Motorola is really pulling through. Can't wait to see what else they come out with next.Pros:*High Quality Build*High Quality accessories (USB cable, 12vdc to dual USB charger)*Easy to use*Easy to put on and take offCons:*Price. To me 39.99 sounds like the target price for this thing. $50+ is a bit steep and why it only gets 4 stars.*Doesn't look like many cases will fit with this dock. Even though it has a removable trim piece to accommodate cases, I don't think any Otterbox product will fit on this thing as well as any other cases more than 1-2mm thick.

B004M5IUHY,ADLVFFE4VBT8,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[3, 3]","Motorola's Command ONE is a solid, functional, useful and sometimes fun to use product and it has what it takes to, possibly, stand out in the crowded and fiercely competitive field of Bluetooth headsets. I will start by discussing its features grouped into several distinct categories. I marked a feature with a + when happy, - when not happy and = when in between or indifferent.COMFORT+ LIGHT WEIGHT - as in 'not heavy'. I had the ONE continuously attached to my ear for a couple of hours and I didn't experience any significant discomfort. In fact, when not in use I was barely aware of its existence.+ 5 GEL COVERS - they are easy to change and try out.+ EAR HOOK - can be set to use with either left or right ear.+ NOISE CANCELLATION - not bad at all. Tested in a noisy office and street environment and I was happy with the results.= CALL QUALITY - again, better then most. Heard slight hisses and echoes but only occasionally. Call recipients had no complaints.DESIGN (ERGONOMICS)+ JAWBONE-like SHAPE - about 2 inches long, follows the face curvature.- CALL BUTTON at the back, right 'on' the USB charging port is small and hard to get to when the ONE is in ear.= ON/OFF slider switch, on one side could have been done better.+ VOLUME and MUTE BUTTONS are on the other side, relatively easy to reachFEATURES AND CAPABILITIES+ EASY PAIRING - with up to 2 devices simultaneously+ VOICE COMMANDS - can pick up a call by simply saying 'answer' or... not by saying 'ignore' when prompted. Easy voice-based setup.+ VOICE DIALING - will recognize names in your phone book, even ask you to specify if you have more than one number for the same person (cell, home, office)+ CALLER ID - will say who is calling before prompting you to either answer or ignore the incoming call.= MOTOSPEAK APP, a little buggy, compatible with Android and some Blackberries - reads incoming text messages and even lets you respond via text by speaking your reply.+ 4 HOURS TALK TIME (about) on a full charge, several days on standby.+ USB MICRO PORT for charging. Was able to charge it with Kindle's and a Blackberry's and it should work with most 'third party' chargers.= ENCASED BATTERY - can't be replaced.CONTENTS AND WARRANTY* COMMAND ONE Bluetooth device as discussed above.* EAR HOOK* 5 GEL COVERS* CHARGER* MANUAL (English, Spanish, French)* MOTOSPEAK PAMPHLET, explaining how to get it for an Android phone or Blackberry* ONE YEAR WARRANTY - phone numbers are provided, which is a good thing.EVALUATIONHoping not to repeat myself too much, these are the positives: I am happy with the way this headset feels in my ear - as in I'm hardly aware of it when not in a call. The almost hands-free operation and the good noise cancellation make it ideal for use in a car, especially when you're not driving alone and you don't feel like piping your conversation through the speakers. Its ability to stay connected to TWO devices makes it good in an office environment. I found the sound quality to be adequate and I can say the same for its ability to function on one charge for up to 4 hours.On the negative side, I did NOT like the placement of the 'call' button. You don't need to touch it on an incoming call but you need to press it to originate a call or to initiate any voice conversation with the device (voice dialing). The button is too small and, in my view, misplaced at the 'near ear' end of the set. The other semi-disappointment is the MotoSpeak app which was difficult to install on a Blackberry Bold and appears to be a 'work in progress' at this time - but I don't rely much on texting so I can't say that I'd be using MotoSpeak if it were better.A properly placed TALK button would have made the Command ONE a 5-star because I would have loved it. The way it is, I still 'like' it and, therefore, 4 stars are well earned.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;",4.0,1301011200,"03 25, 2011",Motorola CommandOne Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging,28.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41N1VJwLz-L._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 7116},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"

B004M5IUHY,A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,Comdet,"[4, 4]","One of the most important attributes for a headset is comfort. I've tried a few over the years, but always have found them to be a pain (literally!) if they are worn for more than 20 minutes or so. I'm very happy to report that the Moto is a dream when it comes to comfort - had it on for a three+ hour drive, and didn't even know it was there. Plus, it didn't cause a problem with my glasses, unlike other models I've tried.Set up was very straightforward - basically just follow the prompts and it works. I didn't try out the text-to-voice feature but it sounds interesting. Not really something I would use since I don't text much at all, but if you're text-heavy, that feature would certainly be of value.Audio quality was excellent. Had no problems hearing callers even with music playing in the car. Range was also very good.My complaints are two-fold. First a minor one - this comes packed in what I would consider to be wasteful packaging. Looks impressive in a clear, thick plastic box, but the amount of materials used for packing is unnecessary. I did not, however, deduct anything from its rating due to that.What did cause a loss of one star was the mic pickup. In a quiet environment it was fine. But, in a noisy environment (such as outside, in a crowded restaurant or with moderate-level music playing in the car), it picks up so much background noise that people had problems hearing me. To ensure this was actually the case, I loaned it to a friend and had him call me so I could hear for myself. It seems that the mic is either way too sensitive or not sufficiently directional - it truly is hard to hear the person's voice when they are using the headset should they be in anything other than a pretty quiet environment..But, that aside, this is the best headset I've used to date.

B004M5IUHY,A3O60C5513YYD6,H. J. Spivack,"[1, 2]","I have kind of a long history of trying headsets, kind of liking them and then, almost immediately, losing them.  In my experience, they require complex cables (complex in this case usually means a very small plug that is not useful for anything except the headset), rubber or vinyl knobs that are supposed to insert in your ear but often fall off and are lost and not-so-great sound.Let's face it, the reason for a headset is that holding a cell phone to your ear can be a dicey proposition. Cellphones are not designed to be cradled between head and shoulder and whenever I get a call on mine, I usually call back from a landline.  A headset is meant to alleviate this, but by the time I find mine, the call is generally over.The Motorola CommandOne comes (as advertised) in a premium package (""Premium Packaging!"").  The box is comes in is a miracle of plastic engineering but it gets thrown away almost immediately.  Looks good on a shelf, but its designed for the purpose of selling the headset without another function.The headeset itself is small, a good sign.  I used to hate the ones that were long and that would hang out away from my head at an angle making me look like I was trying to talk to aliens.  This one fits in the ear and barely extends outward.  It picks up sound very well (almost too well, I made a call outside and ambient noise drowned my voice out for the person I was speaking to).  It also can be quite loud.  The button on the side is easily found and works immediately. I paired it with my Droid phone in about 10 seconds and it has worked nearly perfectly since.As far as cables go, Motorola has engineered this one to accept the same cable that powers my Droid and my Kindle.  In short, the cable is common, not complex and slots easily into the headset.  A little light next to the plug (on the body of the headset) tell you charging status.  While I have not tested the dictation command function, which I have not interest in using, I believe that this item is a really good one.All in all, a great headset.  The only reason I took one star off is that for all the premium packing, the headset did not come with a box or a bag that you could keep and use to store the headset in a bag while you are on the go.  Right now, its loosely floating around in the pocket of my carry bag...not a longevity scheme for something that is relatively small.  I'd have rather paid for less of a package and more of a functional way to stow the headset.If you are looking for a headset, this is a good one and not expensive.

B004M5IUHY,A3DZFEICHK5LF2,Just Trying to Help,"[17, 20]","Motorola regains its shining spot on top of the phone/ accessories market.The motorola CommandOne not only matches the Jawbone and Plantronics top of the line bluetooth headsets, it passes them.  Motorola dominated the market for years as bluetooth headsets struggled to fill their promise of clear easy wireless phone call use.  If you didn't know which model to get then you were always safe with Motorola.Recently, Jawbone came to market with innovative style, comfort and signature noise canceling technology.  For the last few years, the cadillacs of the bluetooth market according to most blog reviews was either made by Plantronic (longtime phone accessory manufacturer) or Jawbone.  Not anymore.I have been using the Jawbone ERA with an Iphone 4.  But after a week of evaluation with the CommandOne, the Jawbone is officially kicked to the curb.The CommandOne Features:CrystalTalk(tm) technology cancels everyday noiseListen and dictate text messages with MotoSpeak(tm) application*Stealth mode microphone cancels wind up to 40mphVoice controls to manage calls by saying ""answer"" or ""ignore""Compared to Jawbone... the noise cancellation on the CommandOne is equal to or better than Jawbone.  For the Jawbone to work, it must be positioned correctly touching your face so it knows what to filter.  The CommandOne accomplishes the same task without the physical contact.  If you are wearing your headset all day or for a long time the Jawbone moves around and loses noise cancellation.  The CommandOne can rest in whatever comfortable position you want and works fantastic.  In several environments, the car, living room with TV on and walking outside I consistently got better feedback from the person at the other end of the conversation.  There was no doubt the people I was speaking to loved the CommandOne and consistently said it was better than the jawbone.On the issue of comfort, there are many ear rubber fitting pieces that come with the CommandOne.  They also include an over the ear loop, if you prefer that position.  But the headset fits comfortably without it.  This headset is so light weight, you will forget you are wearing it. This is an incredible feature.The rest of the features of the CommandOne that really come in handy are the hard buttons on the device.  Aside from volume and start and stop call buttons, there is a mute button and most importantly an On Off Switch.  This saves battery life on both the headset and the phone, when you aren't using it.  This has been my biggest ""pet peeve"" especially if you want to easily switch to a car system.I was unable to test the text to speech because the programs for that are only on Android and Blackberry devices.  But, with the Iphone it seamlessly connects and disconnects when you need it.Finally, all the top of the line headsets are putting massive speakers into their systems.  This is so you can listen to music or audiobooks or streaming youtube.  The speaker also makes it easier if you need a loud volume headset.  For me, i have listened to music, but just in one ear, its not as satisfying.  However, I find for audiobooks it works really well.This headset is at the top of the price scale, but its added features are worth the extra money.  You will not want a new one in 6 months.  Bluetooth headsets have finally fulfilled the promise of easy wireless accessories.  It couldn't be easier or more simple to use, and it does its job very, very well.",5.0,1304640000,"05 6, 2011",Motorola CommandOne Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging,28.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41N1VJwLz-L._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 7116},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"

We communicate a lot over our cell phones and rely heavily on our bluetooth headsets. Problem is, the cheaper headsets, while OK if you're in a quiet background, are notorious for picking up irritating background noise. The voice quality is not that great either as it gets muddled into the background noise.Enter Motorola's CommandOne Bluetooth Headset. WOW! I had the opportunity to use this first. I found it much more comfortable to wear and easier to use. I enjoy how the device tells when the status of the bluetooth. I also like how it respond to my voice commands to pick up the phone when it's ringing. It easily connected and worked smoothly with my Samsung Flight A797. I really enjoyed this headset while I had it.Eventually, I gave the Motorola Bluetooth Headset to my husband. I figured this would be the true test on the sound and voice quality of this device. He uses it with his iPhone 4. WOW AGAIN! This bluetooth made a huge difference in the quality of our communication! Way less background noise and more of my husband's voice. It works so well that there are times I ask if he's still there. HUGE difference from the cheap headset he had the last time. (I hated that thing!)However, these are the problems my husband has encountered. The Motorola seems to take longer to connect/reconnect to his iPhone 4. (I did not have this problem with my Samsung, so I'm wondering if the issue is with the iPhone itself.) The rubber piece that covers the charging port falls off. (My husband, despite being a truck driver, is not rough with his stuff and neither is he heavy-handed. This is why I knocked of a star on this otherwise 5-star device.) Other than that, he's been very pleased with his headset. He enjoys his conversations more with way less stress and frustration.The Motorola CommandOne is truly a worthwhile headset consider. It truly does a better job of blocking out background noise while letting in the user's voice. Yes, there are other good features on this headset, but the quality of the voice alone makes this device a winner.",4.0,1308182400,"06 16, 2011",Motorola CommandOne Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging,28.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41N1VJwLz-L._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 7116},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"

Since this is an iPhone-specific review however (iPhone 4 in particular), here are some things I've found lacking with the unit.  Aside from the fact it belches out the word ""Droid"" every time it connects, it's larger and doesn't sound as good as mySamsung HM3700 Stereo Bluetooth Wireless Headset(which btw would not get very high marks either given the amount of connection issues I've had with it).  The CommandOne has similar connection issues as the bluetooth connection is dropped periodically (something that rarely if ever happened with my lost and dearly missed Moto 790).  As far as the sound quality, I'm not trying to make this read like an audiophile review of a bluetooth headset but it's loud and trebly and not a device I'd prefer to listen to for an extended conversation.  Conversely, the Samsung 3700 sounded terrific (when it would stay connected).  Battery life seems to be alright and the voice commands are great.

B004M5IUHY,A3LGT6UZL99IW1,"Richard C. Drew ""Anaal Nathra/Uthe vas Bethod...","[69, 73]","I have a Droid X, and like most smart phones out there, you can use voice commands with the phone. Say ""call home""  to call home, or ""call office"", etc. Well, you can use the CommandOne to send voice commands to the phone - press the call button, and you'll hear your phone's prompt to speak a voice command. Say ""call home"" (assuming you programmed that into your phone"" and the phone will dial.) The phone stays in my pocket or on my belt  - I just tap the call button and speak a command.  Of course you can just say ""call"" followed by the phone number. The point is, you don't have to touch your phone. That's a feature of your phone, and the CommandOne fully supports it.Sure, you may get some strange looks walking around spurting commands, but it's just so techy. 20 years ago you would have undergone psychiatric evaluation - now it's normal.For incoming calls the CommandOne will speak the caller ID of the incoming call.  You say either ""answer"" or ""ignore"" - Ignore will send the call to voicemail.The charger uses the standard mini-USB cable - the same one the Droid uses (and many other newer phones) so you can use the same charger cable (USB from your laptop, for example) - just plug it in and go.  An A/C charger is included - so you can use it with the CommandOne or your cell phone! Nice additional benefit.When you first turn on the CommandOne  you hear a battery status - the CommandOne  actually tells you how full the battery is (there's also a colored status LED.)  Not paired, or cell phone Bluetooth not on? The CommandOne will give you instructions. After you pair, make sure the phone's Bluetooth is on before the CommandOne  is turned on - then you won't hear the instructions- You'll hear ""xxx connected"". For example, I hear ""Droidx connected"" - yes, it tries to pronounce Droidx.It's also a wireless headset for listening to music. Pretty much all smart phones support Bluetooth music - the phone will use the CommandOne  as a mono headset.  Not the best quality, but not bad. The music will pause when a call comes in or when you tap the call button, then resume when you're done.Texting: You need to download the free App for your phone (Droid or BlackBerry.) After you install this, the phone will read text messages to you and allow you to reply, automatically converting your verbal reply to a text message.I did have the phone lock up on me a couple of times over a few days - just power-cycling the headset fixed this. This only happened with using the voice commands - my Droid also locks with voice commands without the CommandOne  connected, so I'm prone to blame the Droid, not the CommandOne.Comfort - There are four additional ear adapters included, and you really should try a few different ones.  After finding the best fit I was able to wear the CommandOne  all day with no discomfort.  It's much smaller and lighter than my Jabra - and can be worn with glasses (unlike my Jabra.)Another cool feature - you can pair two different phones.Range - I left the phone in my gym bag and walked over 20 feet away - never lost the connection.Yes it's a bit pricey, but it is very lightweight and feature packed.

I really hate having things in my ears, but this isn't too objectionable. If you don't mind having things in your ears, it shouldn't bother you at all.  The headset is very light, and the hook is smooth and comfortable even with glasses.Stylishly subtle- If I have to be Borg, I don't want anything too obtrusive. This is a nice matte black that's slim and not at all flashy.Sound quality:Listening- Sound quality is good, and you can turn it up or down either with the phone or the headset itself. So you can adjust as needed for the call you are on.Speaking- There is virtually no pick up of the sounds and conversations around me for the person I'm talking to. Using my phone normally, you can hear more ambient sounds than you do with the headset.Voice commands- Decent set of easy to remember voice commandsCons-Sound qualitySpeaking- sometimes there is a slight hollowness for the person on the other end.

While this is a good BT which connects quick, is loud, and others can hear me fine...even over my work truck which is a Mack Granite dump truck, it's not good when paired the with my GS3. It announces Caller ID name from contacts which is a *must* and battery life seems to just as good or better then the Blueant but it KILLS the battery on my phone. For some reason, I guess because of A2DP, keeps my phone awake through Bluetooth Share. There is no way to disable BT share without killing the caller ID feature. My GS3 loses approx. 5-7% an hour in batt life with no use and cpu continuously runs in intervals...about 1/2 the time total when paired with the commandone. Using the Blueant, I'd lose 2% an hour. All in all, I get maybe 10 to 11 hours out of my phone with the command one while before I was getting 18-20 with moderate use using the blueant.

B004M5IUHY,A2EYCL2ZT0PSTX,Timothy J. Kindler,"[2, 2]","I've had the Motorola CommandOne Bluetooth headset for about three weeks.  Although not needed on a daily basis, it has performed admirably when called into duty.  The out-of-box experience and initial setup was painless.  After the initial charge, I was off and running.  The unit paired immediately and simply with my Motorola Droid phone (running Android 2.2).  The headset is light and comfortable enough to wear for extended periods.  Voice commands seem to work well.  I found the sound quality to be excellent, both in terms of listening and speaking.  Prior to getting the CommandOne, I have mostly been using my Droid in ""hands free"" mode by using the speakerphone.  Although safe while driving, I was forced to speak loudly so that the person I was talking to was able to hear me.  Now, with the CommandOne, I can speak in a normal tone of voice without being drowned out by background noise.  The people that I talk to while in the car have commented on the improvement.I downloaded the MotoSpeak app to my phone to allow text-to-voice and voice-to-text capability.  For the most part, this has worked as advertised.  The incoming text messages announce the name of the sender.  Messages have been read accurately.  I have used the ""call the sender"" function without any problems.  The return voice-to-text messages have not been as flawless as the incoming messages - sometimes the message is misinterpreted.

After reading another review and finding out that you MUST disconnect the headset from the charger before pairing (many thanks to the reviewer who included that tidbit in their review because I was going to return it thinking it was not compatible - OK, it was 3am when I was playing with it), it paired easily and flawlessly.  I tried out the Motospeak 2.0, set up was simple and user friendly and the device paired flawlessly.  Motospeak not only recorded every word I said correctly but repeated the entire text word for word and then asked me if I wanted to send it.  I didn't even have to repeat what I said 5 times like my other headsets, no aggravation and I didn't want to bounce the bluetooth off the wall, it got it right the first time.  The product itself seems to be quality constructed as compared to the other 2 bluetooths I owned and broke due to being cheaply made.  I agree with another reviewer that the call button is a little awkward but the excellent sound quality, command usage, Motospeak software and other benefits easily outweigh that very minor design flaw.  The volume level is crystal clear and perfect.  I'm loving the hands-free driving mode and saying my commands and not having to look at and push buttons on my phone.

However, the sound was never great to begin with and bass almost non-existant unless you pushed the buds into your ears and held them there.  The buds are all gigantic, even the smallest ones, so finding a good fit is impossible (would fit snuggly in nostrils though.)  After about 13 months, 2 rubber strips placed just above the ear buds on the side facing the temples, began to slip off exposing wires, etc.  I called the Motorola for a fix and they said they won't cover it, even though it's an obvious design flaw.  I glued it, but it appears the damage was done as sound quality suffered after that.  Battery life was good, but the buttons were very finicky.  You have to press hard and some times several times to get the volume up or down, or to skip, and that was an issue from day one.  The volume never got that loud, ANY outside noise would make it diffcult to hear.  Partly due to volume itself and partly due to poor fitting earbuds.  In comparison to standard apple headphones, the volume and sound quality were HORRIBLE...but avoiding wires while running or at the gym was worse the sacrafice of sound.I would NOT recommend this to anyone.

The battery would no longer hold a charge.The Motorola feels like it's much better made, and not as fragile as the one from the other company (iKross).  It slips over my ears easily (over the earpieces of my glasses), and fits comfortably.  It rides well, and does not slip out of my ears.  It has better sound as well.  The control buttons are much superior.  Instead of having three buttons that have multiple functions controlled by the number of times you click, the S10 has seven buttons - three on each earpiece (easily located) and one on the underside of the part that goes around the back of your head which you push to activate your bluetooth connection, also easily located.  The buttons on the left side control your volume (top and bottom), the middle accepts a phone call.  On the right, the upper and lower buttons take you to the next or previous track, while the middle one puts your music on pause.Since I primarily use this while I'm riding my bicycle, it seems to be the perfect headphone for me.  I can listen to my music, but still hear enough to be aware of a car sneaking up on me, I can quickly and easily change tunes or volume with just one easily located button click, or answer a call.

B004QWOSLK,A298GL2D0BHGKZ,J. Fig.,"[1, 1]","I have been searching Amazon for a headset I could  use while riding my bike, so of course, I wanted something that would stay put, comfortable and sound good. And I found this piece, which honestly speaking, is not bad, but it does have some flaws and sound issues.The headset comes in the retail box with three pairs of ear plugs; one installed, two on the side. A charger and a small instructions booklet.Charging the unit is easy, simply flip the rubber cover at the back of the heaset, plug the usb cable, the light on the headset will remain red until it is fully charged, turning blue.Pairing the headset is very easy. Turn the bluetooh on your device (Galaxy 3 in my case), do a scan and voila, you're done. I didn't need to enter the standard ""0000"" code, the phone allowed it to connect right away.The headset has all the buttons needed to control your music and phone calls, on the left side you have the volume and phone buttons, on the right, you have the play/pause and tracks buttons.Comfort:I wore these puppies for about 7 hour on and off. Comfort wise, it's a hit and miss, and it all depends on how you place the headset, but I did notice that if you have average to above average size ears, this headset can be a bit painful to wear. Again, this can be avoided to a certain degree with how you wear them. The instructions say to firs put the headset on an upward position with the back of it in fron of your face, then slide it over your head towards the back of your neck and let them sit on your ear. Problem is, if your ears are not under the loop, they will get pinched. Also, if you have a big head, they might press against your head.I'll say this, they stay put, but you have to make sure you have the right size plugs on them, so they sit on your ear canals and not in them, more on that later.Sound:Just ok. They lack bass, but have the right amount of mids and highs. The biggest let down for me was the lack of volume, but I'm not sure if this was due to the phone or the headset, but probably a combination of both, point is, I felt the headset could use more punch and higher levels, I need this for long bike rides, I mountain bike, so I don't have to worry about traffic and such. There are just a couple of equilizer settings that are supported by bluetooth technology, at least on my end. For example, I couldn't get the extra bass setting to engage, it kept telling me that it wasn't compatible with bluetooth. I was able to get Rock, Pop, Normal, pretty much every other settings beside extra bass and treb. Sound quality also depends, at least for me, on how the ear plugs fit; I was under the impression that the deeper they're in, the better the sound, well, I learned my lesson, it turns out that for somebody with average size ear canals, the pre-installed plugs are perfect and will transfer sound much better; they sit at the entrance of the ear canals, covering them, but not going in all the way. With the pre-installed plugs, the sound was much richer and solid. When I had smaller size plugs, the sound was extremely flat and lacked definition. With high quality files, the sound is much better, but not enough to give this headset a higher rank. Low quality files or older tunes, do not sound great, they're decent.Controls:A bit on the stiff side ; they require some getting used to. They can't simply be pressed, you must place between your thumb and index, then press down, or you'll be pressing against  your ear, which can be painful and distracting.Phone Calls:Very clear. As you receive a call, you will hear a very subttle gingle on the headset, so you will hear this, plus your phone's own ring, unless of course, your phone is on vibrate.Range:Very impressed. I was able to walk around the house with no signal drops. Of course, as I turned corners into rooms that were in a more intricate part of the house, I noticed a drop. But as far as actual range, these things are amazing. Needless to say, while I had the phone and headset close together (pocket, biking pack, etc), the signal is extremely good/strong.Sunglasses:Not so great. I have a few pairs of oakleys, I have the Juliets, 5 Square and Half Jacket...With both the half jacket and 5's it was a mess, they kept popping outward in front of my face, they both have plastic frames. With the Juliets, which have a metal frame, it was much better in regards to them staying put, but not so comfortable overall. In conclusion, you may have some problems with glasses and will depend on their shape.In conclusion:I ended up giving the headset to my wife, who is a small girl and loves to listen to music while walking our dog and when she's doing things around the house. I give this set a 3 star ranking, because they do work and credit's due where it's due. I will however, keep on looking for the right set for my needs.

B004QWOSLK,A19WAVWO2X02XG,JHW,"[1, 1]","Let me start by saying that I own theMotorola S305 Bluetooth Stereo Headset, which I have been using happily for a year or so, but I wanted a second, in-ear pair of Bluetooth headphones for several reasons.  So I have nothing against Motorola products. Indeed, Motorola has always been my go-to brand for Bluetooth -- in addition to the S305, I've bought theMotorola DC800 Bluetooth Stereo Gateway, aMotorola H700 Bluetooth Headset, and aMotorola HS850 Bluetooth Headset.Let me also add that, unlike some reviewers who discovered as much late, I knew how these headphones were supposed to fit from the get-go -- looped over the ear.Yet even when worn properly, these headphones still cause an incredible degree of discomfort. The band is stiff and heavy, which it presumably needs to be inasmuch as it contains the electronics (unlike the S305s, whose electronics are contained in the on-ear portion). Given this relative inflexibility, it binds the mastoid bones just behind the ear. This is a indeed an unpleasant and uncomfortable sensation. If you like the sensation of having your head in a vice, these are the headphones for you.In addition, none of the four provided earpieces provided me with a decent fit, let alone a comfortable one. I know in-ear earbuds, how they should fit, and how they affect the sound. Earbuds should slide easily into one's ear, but should not be too loose (unless you like tinny sound) or too tight (unless you like discomfort). The ideal fit provides both a nice, comfortable seal and a decent sound with good low frequency response. These earpieces provided neither. Three are uncomfortable, and one is too loose.To add insult to injury, the sound is decidedly subpar, certainly compared to the S305 (which, in my book, are simply adequate). No matter which earpieces one uses -- even ones with a tight (albeit uncomfortable) seal that presumably should aid with low frequency response, there is very little bottom. If I were to guess, I would say that the frequency response drops off a good 12 dB below 120 Hz, irrespective of earpiece. I have other, wired earbuds that have come with my various devices, and I've never had a problem choosing buds (either as shipped or from the extras provided) that both fit and improved the low-end.I have yet a couple of other quibbles, neither of which I would call minor. The power button is essentially a 1/8th inch rubber-embossed screw head on the bottom of the band and requires a significant amount of pressure, and provides little feedback. All of the other control buttons (pause/play, ffwd, rev, call/answer) are on the ends of the band just above the earbuds, and are similarly small, rubber-embossed press switches, so unless you place a finger behind the bottom of the band, you end up pushing the earbud deeper into the ear. Ow.In sum, this headset is an extreme disappointment in design and performance. Even if you could somehow adjust to the fit and discomfort, you are left with the inferior sound. Look elsewhere if you want in-ear buds -- and let me know if you recommend something else, because I am currently looking. (UPDATE: I have since purchased theLG Tone HBS-700 headset-- it is amazingly comfortable, cleverly designed, and -- with the right earbud size -- has more than decent sound.) If you don't care about in-ear/on-ear, you'll find that the S305s, despite the on-ear miniature hockey puck look, are much more comfortable and provide much better sound.I have been an Amazon customer since 1997 (1995 if you count CDNow, which Amazon took over).

Was prepared to return immediately if the reviews were correct, but I'm not disappointed (horribly) yet.Pro:  Sound is GOOD.  Perhaps not quite as good as the S9 models, wont replace your BOSE QC's, but DEFINITELY GOOD enough for mobile, running/workout headphones.  I don't get the ""tinny"" reviews; perhaps those folks are using low bit-rate music...and these are the first headphones that were good enough to pick it up?Construction certainly FEELS more solid.  I haven't tested the ""water/sweat resistance"" yet...will get to that...in due course.The Blue-tooth reception seems stronger with these.  The 9's had issues with a laptop sitting at arms length...not these.Cons:The controls are hard to push, and they are located RIGHT OVER THE EAR so when you push on them, you are jamming the earbuds deeper in the ears.  Motorola should re-locate these controls to the down-loop right BEHIND the ear...so it pushes on the knobby part of the back of your head...would be MUCH nicer there.These are a little bulkier than the S9's.  They still wear well, but are shaped different on the back, stand out a little more, and seem a little heaver.  But, again, still WEAR WELL...just as good as, or more snugly even then the S9's.Pairing with multiple devices, at least a computer and an iPhone doesn't go smoothly.  Pairing with the computer is ""FUN"" to figure out (make sure you go into blu-tooth devices and check the ""headphones"" box) and the will work fine, but will select an iPhone over the computer if it has information for both.  Had to turn the blu-tooth off on the phone to get the computer to pick it up.They went with the new ""slim"" USB power jack.  Why?  This probably annoys me the most.

B004QWOSLK,A60A31DFFUMAW,Kyle Veatch,"[0, 0]","I bought this headset knowing that I would mainly use it during work outs. At first I was not sure out the fit or form factor as I have seen much more slim and light weight head phones, but after using them for a month I am generally very happy with these headphones. When I first put them on I was worried that they were putting too much pressure on the sides of my head, but I think that akward feeling goes away quickly because I was not used to it. Also I am sure they stretch out a little bit. The fit and feel may scare some people away, but I have been using them for over a month both on a treadmill and also doing a lot of weight lifting and these headphones have yet to fall off or feel uncomfortable. Most of the time I forget they are even there, only sometimes needing to adjust the back of the headphones, which sometimes does fall a little low on your neck. I think the thing I like most about these headphones are the number of controls on the device. I really like having a pause/play button on the headphones, that way I can pause my workout if I need a water break or to change my weights around. It has a total of 6 buttons, 3 on each ear. It does take some learning to know which is where, and it took me a few days to learn how much pressure to push on the buttons, because it seems as if the water resistance method of sealing the buttons makes them harder to press than other headsets. Also, I like that I can press down the call button on the left ear side and it activates my voice dialers on my phone (Google Now on my Android phone). So overall I was very suprised by how much I like these headphones. The controls are great, they are water resistant so I dont worry about sweat ruining them, the distance for the bluetooth as I can walk across the gym and they are still streaming audio, and they do a good job of staying on my head even when I am running or doing heavy cardio. The only bad thing about them is probably the oversized rear of the headset where the battery is stored. If they could slim that down a bit they would be perfect. I also seemed to get a solid 5-6 hours of streaming time on the battery.BONUS TIP: These work very well in my garage when I am doing wood working with loud tools. I simply put these on, stream my audio, and then put on some over the ear protective headphones and I can hear my music perfectly while still protecting my ears from damage of loud power tools.",4.0,1392854400,"02 20, 2014",Motorola S10-HD Bluetooth Stereo Headphones - Retail Packaging,43.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31dEbmQ7GgL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1638},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

It will only pair with one device at a time (iPad, iPhone, etc.), which is a tad annoying, but I don't know if that's part of the Bluetooth specification or something that Motorola did.  You can perform a factory reset in about a minute, so it's not a huge deal.Regarding issues with sweat, I've probably run about 12 hours with the headphones and in that time and I have had zero issues with sweat causing them to malfunction, and let me be clear, I run in a region with 70-95% humidity, so there is plenty of sweat.  I cannot account for the problems that others have had, but it hasn't been an issue for me.  The one issue I have had with sweat focuses on the earbuds.  The headset comes installed with the largest set.  When I ran with those after about 20 minutes the sweat and the bouncing of my body would produce a popping sound in my ear from the earbuds.  I changed to the next smaller size and the problem disappeared.Another complaint I've read about is the fit.  I wouldn't say I have a small head or a big head.  Mine is more oval than round.  The headphones fit me fine, but if my head were a cm wider, I'm not sure they would still fit well.  Unfortunately they are not adjustable.  If they don't fit return them.Finally, a word about the sound quality.  I think it's very satisfactory considering it's wireless earbud technology.  I'm not an audiophile, but I am an information technology professional, and one piece of advice that I give to my customers is wired is always going to be better than wireless in terms of overall performance.  You go with wireless (whatever) for convenience at the cost of some quality.  If you're looking for concert-hall quality sound or have a very fine ear, these are probably not what your looking for.  As I said before, I think they are very decent, but if accoustical quality is your thing then get a pair of Bose or Sennheiser wired headphones.Overall, for what I purchased them for, which is running, I am very satisfied.  I wish I could pair them with both my iPad, iPhone, and laptop simultaneously, but I can live with resetting.  The fit could be a bit looser, but again, it's not a show stopper for me.I hope you enjoy yours.",4.0,1313193600,"08 13, 2011",Motorola S10-HD Bluetooth Stereo Headphones - Retail Packaging,43.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31dEbmQ7GgL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1638},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

I didn't expect beats quality, but I expect some sort of HD sound. No bass, no range, just garbage. The volume was kinda trash too.

B004QWOSLK,A3NY8UC83LFODF,Michael Moy,"[1, 1]","I bought the S9 a few years ago and they were perfect in terms of comfort and performance and then they died after about a year from the usual sweat problems. They could still be used if they were dried out for a few days but being only able to use them every few days wasn't a solution. I went wired for about 18 months and then found the S10s.They arrived last week and I've used them a few times while working out though not for running. They feel heavier and tighter than the S9s. I have to work the top of my ears carefully under the top loop part of the S10 so that I don't feel pinched. The feeling that I get is that the back part is heavier than on the S9 and the added pressure amplifies the feeling back there. One other downside is that the buttons are harder to press. On the S9, the buttons were bigger and easier to find and press. On the S10, they are small are require more pressure to press.It is possible that it loosens up over time so I will give it a chance.I also get the feeling that the newer unit is much, much better at keeping sweat out. The seals seem to be better and some of the negatives in UI that I wrote about may have been due to compromises to improve durability.The S9s are still for sale and I'm tempted to buy another pair of those and alternate between the two - I'm hoping that the S9 would last longer if it were left to completely dry out after each use. I will write an update on the S10 in a few months. The earlier versions of these were terrible WRT durability but they work reasonably well if you're willing to replace them from time to time.

B004QWOSLK,A1VR1HIOVQWN09,Mike,"[1, 1]","Edited 06/24/2012So the headset is worse and worse by day. Since my last post, the headset now skips through tracks. It makes my Iphone sound like a broken walkman CD Player when a CD skips. It also takes me a while to turn the headset on. The power button may take me a few minutes to turn on. I now give this second headset 1 start because it skips, the hardware and buttons malfunction, and it is hardly reliable. Shop around before buying this one.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edited 06/02/2012So Since my last post, I lost full functionality of the track up key on the headset and the volume up button. These are 2 of the most important buttons for me on the headset. I called Motorola and they cover the headset for 1 year from the date of purchase by manufacturers warranty. I do have to pay for shipping in sending the headset back to them. If not They charge me for incidentals. I was disappointed I had to pay anything knowing that there headset malfunctioned.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edited 05/23/2012 after a few Months of UseThe Headphones sound great and are more comfortable as you break them in. They have a decent battery life. I;m getting 3 to 4 days of gym time a piece. My biggest complaint why my rating went from 5 to 3 to 2 stars is that the Track Up button stopped working all of a sudden. It is either not waterproof as claimed, or there is a hardware issue as I have found with most Motorola products. Even though it has this issue, the sound quality, and sync ability to blue tooth makes this one of the only options on the market for Hands Free Gym Sweat Proof Headphones. For this reason I most likely will by another one when this one dies. It may seem like a confusing review, but Motorola produces many products with hardware defects, like my old Droid Phone, and their headphones. It still is a great product aside from its shortcomings, but needs improvement.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I previously bought these for my brother. I figured they were the latest and greatest for him. I recently bought these because my Motorola S9-HD's gave out and wouldn't turn on. These headphones are alright. I found that the S-9's had more bass and better overall sound quality. Also the s-9's were more comfortable. This one gives you different ear buds and is a little tight on the head and ears to the point where if you do not have the right tips on, it hurts your ear. I bought this model mainly for the gym. I figured it would take more sweat and so far it seems to.Pros:-Sweat Proof?-Longer Battery Life-Syncs to Iphone much quicker than S9-HD'sCons:-Sound Quality drops slightly from S9-HD's, possibly more acoustic.-Lack of Bass compared to S9-HD's.-Tight Fitting and Uncomfortable at Times.

B004QWOSLK,A2T7LNN1O0LOTT,Mike S.,"[1, 1]","I have owned the Motorola Rokr S9, then the S9-HD and now these S10-HD.The S9 sounded great and worked great but eventually sweat from wearing them while running killed them so I bought the S9-HD and never used them while working out to avoid the same fate. The S9-HD also works and sound great (bass mid range & treble are all great).They were both a little snug fitting and required some tweaking to get them to fit without pinching but aside from that I loved them (still own the S9-HD).Imagine my surprise when I bought and opened the S10-HD and found that not only was it even smaller and tighter as other users are complaining of, it has been made so it is no longer possible to adjust them to relieve the pinching at the back of your head (I haven't even tried to adjust them where they pinch your ears).The sound is something that I'm STUNNED even allowed these to make it from developement to market.I can only describe the sound as something coming from a transistor AM radio. If you think I'm kidding you should pick up a pair.I'm glad my S9-HD still works.UPDATE: In order to give these headphones a fair shake I assumed there MUST be a problem since Motorola couldn't possibly risk their reputation by turning out a product that wasn't even up to par with the previous two iteration, I called Motorola who told me how to reset the headphones.While the reset seemed to improve the audio to the point where they actually sound great, the inability to adjust them to fit will definitely prevent me from wearing them.For those that want to try the reset... first delete the pairing from whatever device you paired your headphones with.Power the headphones on, Hold down the volume + button and hold down the Power button at the same time until the blue light is steady near the power button.Now pair your device with the headphones again and try it out.",3.0,1342137600,"07 13, 2012",Motorola S10-HD Bluetooth Stereo Headphones - Retail Packaging,43.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31dEbmQ7GgL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1638},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B004QWOSLK,A1KY25HG3D9NWB,"PghDrake ""PghDrake""","[1723, 1786]","I've read a LOT of reviews on this product and I have to sum up a lot of the negative reviews and comment on them.  Too many of the negative comments aren't worth reading because these people didn't take the time to get to know their headset and actually use them in normal circumstances.Overall, I love this headset - it does exactly what it's supposed to do and sounds great.  Listening to music, talking on the phone, everything is very clear and loud.  I would suggest that people do NOT place a review on a product they used once and returned, and that you don't listen to reviews from people who did that.  You can't blame the item if the one you bought was broken, either.  This is why I read several reviews of different rankings before I decide on an item.  I bought these headphones last summer (about 7 months ago) to work out with at the gym.  I did not buy them on Amazon as I had a gift card to a competitor - but I have the exact same headset that is pictured here (with the red highlights near the ear buds, I've read that this means they are the ""trainer"" version, but they're the exact same headset as the ones with the white/grey highlights that are selling now except for the color of course).Now I'm going to kind of write the rest of this review in reverse - I'm going to write what others are complaining about and make my own comments:1) Fits Poorly - mine fit great and I do not have a small head.  I'm a ""big and tall"" guy and sure, they may be a LITTLE snug but I like that and need that.  If they were much looser I'd be worrying about them falling off - people have to take that into account for a product that has a battery in it and has no cords or anything to keep them on your head other than that snugness.  Sure - if you have a Charlie Brown head they won't fit, but for everyone else they are fine and may take a little bit of getting used to.2) Sound Quality for Music - I see people complaining about how the sound is poor on their phones or MP3 players, but not many from people saying they looked into their device itself for a solution.  One review had the guy comparing these to Beats by Dre headphones - SERIOUSLY?  Compare a $70 Bluetooth headset to headphones that are what, $200 minimum and with a wire?  Sorry you can't do that.  Sure, you can get higher quality music sound from an expensive set of headphones that are only meant for music (and not phone and not wireless), but that's not what these are for.  I use an iPhone 4 and they sound great to me.  I get bass as well as higher pitches pretty much perfect.3) Sound Quality for Phone - Like above, I've seen mixed reviews based on the phone itself.  Search reviews for key words like your phone manufacturer.  Again I use mine on an iPhone 4 and it works perfectly, I can skip songs and pause as well as control the volume.  I started using these in the car when my car's Bluetooth system (aftermarket item from Parrot I had installed) failed.  My girlfriend said I sounded much louder and more clear on these, plus she could no longer hear the regular road noise (tires on the highway) she used to.  I have yet to hear a complaint from people I call.4) Sweat Proof - Yes, these things work perfectly against sweat from my experience.  I bought these specifically for working out in the gym at first as I wanted to lose weight and would need to listen to music to keep my mind off of how much I hate being at the gym.  Like I said before, I'm a big man and this means I sweat a lot while I'm working out.  I'm also a head shaver, so the sweat flows unhindered from my head - and I have never had an issue with it.  Because they are snug, the headset doesn't slip with the sweat, either.  I can understand one or two complaints where they say water got into the headset, but seriously if a lot of people are saying this I have to wonder if they have the proper ear buds in.  I use the larger ones, myself - but if you use tiny ones you're lowering the chances of them staying dry.  I know several runners that use this headset and they never complain about the sweat in any way.5) Battery Life - I haven't seen many (only a couple) bad reviews on this feature but I thought I'd add it.  The battery life on this headset is unbeatable.  they make great use of the battery in the back and it doesn't feel like a weight pulling on them at all.  The overall weight of the headset is very light actually.  I've used this headset to work out for a full week and only charged it on the weekend for months at a time.  Now that I'm using it more for phone use, I am charging it more but only every 3 days or so.  So, I use them 5 days/week, 3 hours of working out, 7.5 hours of phone time, plus another 4-5 hours of music time at my desk at work and I'm only charging them twice/week.  Note though, that when I'm not using them I generally turn the power off to conserve the battery life.  The charge time seems to be pretty quick for me as well.6) Bluetooth Connection - Again I haven't seen many negative reviews about this but it needs to be said that this thing pairs FAST once you get it set up (programming in the code per the instructions, which takes 2-3 minutes tops).  Now, the trick is to turn Bluetooth on with your phone or other device first, then hold down the power button (center middle of the back/battery area) for a couple of seconds.  The second it beeps, it pairs immediately.  I've had other devices take up to a minute to pair, but this one is perfect.  Also the distance you can be from the phone with this headset is fantastic - I leave the phone in my bag on a seat outside the racquetball court while I am playing and the sound quality is unchanged at large distances.  One day I left my phone running in the locker room and went out to the court and did not realize I didn't have my phone with me - that's a floor and about 60 feet away!7) Controls - Really?  There are people complaining that the controls are hard for them?  There's buttons next to the ear buds and short of having gloves on I can't imagine a reason why anyone would have problems unless they didn't take the time to get used to where the buttons are.  They're perfect for me, and I use them now without even thinking about them.In conclusion, these are great headsets of you are using them to work out without wires.  They are also great for normal headset use and for cell phone use.  They may take some getting used to but what doesn't?  Take the time to figure out which ear buds are best for you, learn how to use the controls and use them for a little while before you decide if they are good or not for you.UPDATE:  How I got this paired with a Win7 LaptopSo, Microsoft's page says this headset is not compatible with Windows 7, because Win7 doesn't support streaming of sound (bluetooth to them is more for input devices like mice, keyboards, etc).  Motorola's pages gives no help for this after extensive searches, so I turned to the web for help because I need to do some training online and didn't want to have a wire going from my ears to the laptop.  It was a lot of trouble but I'll give you the steps I took below so hopefully it will work for you as well.1) Download new drivers for your machine:NOTE, my work laptop is a Dell and it already had the latest Win7 drivers installed.  After searching on the web I found a driver from Acer that actually worked.  I installed these drives:[...]  and rebooted my machine, worked like a charm.2) Clear the Headset's Paired ObjectsThis was a tough one to figure out becuase again I couldn't find this trick on the Motorola site.  Apparently this headset can only pair to one device at a time (strange), so you need to clear whatever it's paired to first and re-pair it to the new one.  To do this, make sure the headset is already ON and not linked to anything (for me, I just had to turn off the bluetooth on my iPhone 4).  Then hold down the + button (volume up button, top one on the left ear piece) then hold down the power button on the back of the headset - hold them both down until the blue light comes on and is solid.  Now you've cleared the headset of whatever it was already paired to.3) Windows should then automatically see the headsetAt the bottom right of your desktop near the clock, find and click the bluetooth button (blue oval).  If you don't see ""Motorola S10-HD"" with a generic bluetooth headset icon, then click ""add a device"" and it will search for it.  It should have found it automatically though.  Personally I never had to type in the connection code, but if you're prompted for it, it's ""0000"" (all zeroes).That should be it - for me this worked and the only real pain is that I have to go through the procedure again when I'm done using the laptop to re-pair it to my iPhone 4 - but it only takes about 30 seconds each time so no big deal and it's worth it to me.  Hopefully this helps you!-Drake",5.0,1326672000,"01 16, 2012",Motorola S10-HD Bluetooth Stereo Headphones - Retail Packaging,43.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31dEbmQ7GgL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1638},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B004QWOSLK,AT4KA5FZ4VJ1J,Pro Consumer,"[2, 3]","I was able to directly compare both the S10-HD and the S9-HD side by side, and here are my impressions.I read the reviews about the S10, especially the negative ones, about the tight fit, discomfort, and lack of bass response.  I needed a pair of bluetooth headphones for running, and since the S10 was specifically designed to be water resistant, I tried to convince myself the naysayers were just not using the headphones correctly.  Well, I was wrong.  The S10 headphones are every bit as uncomfortable as people have said:  specifically, they squeeze a small spot directly above your ear.  I cannot see myself using them for longer than 10 minutes without discomfort.  Also, I was a bit disappointed by the sound quality when I first tried them on, but didn't know how bad it was until I tried on the S9 headphones.The S9 is lighter, more comfortable, and sounds much nicer in terms of audio quality than the S10.  The material that contacts the skin has a more padded texture, and the headphone itself is less rigid so they don't grip as tightly as the S10.  This is not a bad thing, as the lightness of the S9 still allows it to be worn securely in place.  The most noticeable difference was the fidelity.  The S9 has much nicer bass response, but don't let that distract you from the whole soundscape.  The S9 performs better across all frequencys, and really separates the instruments and vocals.  The soundstage is very nice with the S9s.Overall, the only ""benefit"" of the S10 is that it is designed more for exercising, and is supposed to be more water resistant.  I wasn't able to test this, but there are plenty of reviewers that say their S10s shorted out due to sweat/moisture.  That said, I'll stick with the S9s.UPDATE:  I've been comparing the S10-HD and S9-HD side by side again, and I'll change my rating of this product to two stars (up from one) for the following reason: both the reception and battery life on the S10-HD are superior to the S9-HD.  This really irritates me because I'm STILL sticking with the S9-HD due to comfort and fidelity... but I wish Motorola would design a headset with the comfort and fidelity of the S9-HD, and the battery life, reception, and ruggedness of the S10-HD.

They would complain that got tired of their earphones falling out when working out. It great to answer the phone when you are out walking and the microphone is better than the Bluetooth connection in my car (so the people it talk to have told me). I can keep my phone or iPod in my pocket with no need for a special arm band and the biggest and best features is it is wireless and in stereo! I looked for ever to find wireless stereo head sets that were functional until I found this one. I gave it a 4 star because the battery life is not long enough and needs to be recharged after a couple of hours of use. I like to go on long hikes or walks and listen to audio books. A good unabridged book could be an easy 5-7 hr long and it would be nice if it would last that long. I do have a battery booster that I bring along to recharge it so It gets me through the day.

B004QWOSLK,AUX9KZUUB3YCE,R. Nicholson,"[1, 1]","Some thoughts on the Motorola S10-HD Bluetooth Headphones.The Pros:1.) decent audio quality.2.) paired very easily with both my IPhone 5 and IPad mini. However they cannot be both connected at the same time. Switching and connecting was done in seconds by going to... settings > bluetooth > motorola S10-HD and your ready to go.3.) stayed in the ear... no worry about these slipping out, but... (see Cons below)4.) 4 sets of ear tips for different size ears5.) great range... I easily got 50 - 60 feet between my device and these headphones before losing the signal.The Cons:1.) the plastic used to form the horseshoe shape of these headphones had a natural spring-like tension that applied inward pressure to the earpieces to keep them snuggly in place. A great idea, but unfortunately this constant pressure applied to both ears became very uncomfortable, very quickly. I tried all 4 different sizes of ear tips and even the ones that fit me best, still became uncomfortable in a short period of time.2.) also I found that the rounded part that fit behind my head would move slightly if I turned my head left or right and it would often hit my collar, disturbing the snug ear fitting. As a result, I found I was constantly adjusting this unit to find the best position to get the best audio sound and a comfortable fit.Conclusion:A lot of good features, but they quickly became uncomfortable plus the slightest head movement could adversely affect the consistency of the the audio quality.As it is... 2 1/2 StarsRay Nicholsonraynicholsonsreviews@hotmail.com",3.0,1364342400,"03 27, 2013",Motorola S10-HD Bluetooth Stereo Headphones - Retail Packaging,43.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31dEbmQ7GgL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1638},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

They connected easily to my Android phone, and sounded good with Pandora, bTunes, even on phone calls. They even sounded great. The problem was they hurt my outer ears a lot. There was tremendous pressure on the tops of my ears. Obviously, I tried to adjust the fit, in accordance with the directions and the picture on the Motorola website of someone wearing them. Nothing seemed to work. Today, after running 7 miles in them, I decided to return them. 10 minutes later, I realized that the part that was hitting the top of my ears was supposed to go behind the ears. They now feel great, and I'll definitely be keeping them. They even sound better when worn correctly.Before you discount what I'm saying, or assume that I'm a complete moron for not knowing how to wear headphones, be warned that the directions for wearing them, and the picture on the Motorola website imply that you are supposed to wear them incorrectly.Now that I'm wearing them correctly, here are the things they do well:+ Sound Great+ Connect easily+ Switch between calls and music seamlessly+ Feel comfortable, though they are quite a bit heavier than any other headphones, even the older Motorlas (S-9 and S9-HD)+ Very well made.+ The battery life is exceptional and you can charge it off micro-USB.The owner's manual is pretty much useless. The format is tiny, and they put more effort into being hip than providing a useful manual for the product. Fortunately, it is intuitive to use.The price on these is reasonable, considering what you get and what it can do. I bought mine at Best Buy because Amazon didn't have them yet, and the third party sellers that have them on here are kind of pricey.I highly recommend that you buy these. I think that you will love them, once you figure out how to fit them.//update August 24th, 2011 //After having these for a year, I decided to buy another pair to see if they have changed at all. They have but only cosmetically. Although the old ones continue to work well, the second generation of these has some slight changes. One of the many things that hasn't changed is the model number and name. The way to tell the second generation from the first is that the white material that touches your head next to your ears is now red. Also the black plastic on the back/top of them is shiny instead of muted.

These are fine for around the house or car but if you run it is definitely not a good choice. Apparently Motorola feels there are only 4 head sizes in this world and because of this, unless you are one of the 4 sizes, it simply will not fit well. After much frustration of constantly stopping to adjust the set I read the reviews here and thought, ok, I will just keep working at it and eventually will get it right. I am 5'6"" 130#. My head is very average size. The openings to my ears are average size. I know this because I am a nurse. I am not an idiot that doesn't read instructions. I am very good with electronics and any general equipment problem solving.  I tried every single possible way you can use this set because I did not want to have to return them and disappoint my thoughtful husband. If I found a way to get it to sort of fit, I was unable to turn the volume high enough to hear the music and could only hear the wind and traffic. Using them while messing around in the back yard? It was ok and worked well enough, but if you like constantly stopping while you run to adjust fit or try turning up volume over and over then this is the headset for you.

I can listen to music from the basement while my phone is on second floor in my room. And the battery lasts about 3 days with 1-2 hours of use per day.However, there are major comfort issues with these headphones.First major problem is that they squeeze your head and give you headaches if you use them more than 10 minutes. However, I think either I am getting used to the fit or they are coming loose because over time they started to bother me less.Second major problem is that they hurt your ears really bad. I think it is because the back part of the headphones is heavy and  they cling to your ears to keep themselves in place. It hurts bad when you move your head around. However, I found a way around this. Instead of trying to wear them as shown in the manual, I just rest the headphones on my ears and let the heavy back part touch my neck so it doesn't pull on my ears to stay in place.Third major problem is that the in ear part is so huge. I think it is made for giant ears. Well what I do is that I put on the largest earbuds and instead of pushing them in my ear, I let them rest like regular headphones. The largest earbuds provide more cushion for the pressure and they are huge so they cover your ear opening. The downside is that you have to turn the volume up since the headphones are no longer in your ear.And I recently found out that, when they are on, they are causing both my cell phone and tablet to lose wi-fi connectivity.

B004SBJHW4,AP0R93539E7KD,,"[0, 0]","Motorola's Atrix Smartphone is an innovative device on many fronts (ability to become a laptop with the Lapdock accessory, 4G, Fingerprint reader)- but does come with a few issues.In terms of design, I look the sleek ruggedness of the back panel. Despite a plastic build, I found the phone to be solid feeling in the hand (No creaks!), and the portfolio to be quite pocketable. As a phone, performance with call quality is decent, although there were a few occasional dropped calls. Reception with AT&T;'s claimed 4G network is decent (around 2-3 bars). Battery life is also just average, coming in at around 1.5 days of moderate use before I had to recharge it.The dual core processor is speedy enough to handle the operation of day-to-day apps and games, but heats up the phone. As with most phones, opening up more than 5-6 extensive (GPU) applications will slow down the phone. However, the 4&#34; qHD display is vivid, bright (even under the sun, easy to type on), and responsive to multi-touch commands. I found that web browsing was a smooth experience using both WIFI and 4G speeds. Reception for these wireless options (WIFI, Bluetooth, GPS) are stronger than comparable devices.The 5MP camera also produces sharp looking images and HD video, but quality under low light suffers despite the presence of a LED flash. The front video camera is sufficient for video chat programs like Skype/Google Hangouts/WeChat.As for MotoBlur- the skin on top of Android that Motorola has implemented, I would say it's not quite as visually pleasing as say, HTC sense. However, what is unique is the ability to sync together all of your social media venues (Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Gmail...) together in a easy-to-use interface. This makes the phone ideal for younger crowds or business professionals that have an extensive amount of online accounts they want to have access to.The fingerprint reader, which dubs as the power button works as advertised, but I'm not a fan of the 2-in-1 design. I would have preferred having a separate power button (easier to press, less wear and tear on the reader), and then the separate fingerprint reader. Recognition is accurate, and users can program more than 1 finger to allow access to the phone (great for security and faster than a password).Lastly, the lapdock feature- what makes this high-powered smartphone stand out from the crowd- will please moderate users. When the phone is docked (microUSB and microHDMI ports used), the lapdock accessory (purchased separately) becomes a Linex-esk netbook with an 11&#34; screen, stereo speakers, USB ports, a giant touchpad, a full chicklet qwerty keyboard, and a desktop Firefox browser. Astonishingly, the desktop browser is really responsive, and watching streaming videos (Hulu, SolarMovie, NetFlix) were often faster/more optimized than Chrome on a regular Windows computer. However, watching YouTube videos did have some lag, as did flash-heavy websites like The New York Times. The touchpad lacks multitouch, but is responsive like the keyboard. The phone's headphone jack can also still be accessed when docked.The lapdock is a great mobile companion which offers incredible battery life (8 hours & charges the phone), and sleek looks (metal, thin design). It won't replace a computer if you need constant access to things like Word Documents or such Desktop software- but for advanced web browsing it does the trick in style.Overall, a fantastic Android device that merges together high concept and high functionality.",4.0,1405641600,"07 18, 2014","Motorola Atrix 4G MB860 Unlocked GSM Phone with Android 2.2 OS, Dual Core, 5MP Camera, GPS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth - Black",96.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LRjjUblVL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2952},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

Ziltch, Nada, Kapute! They concurred the phones (at least the two I got) were defective. By the way, Motorola no longer carries model "" MB860"" ! Hmmm? And for the record, I even tried a new battery and it didn't work. For those who love this phone ""More power to You"" I hope the phone continues to work well. (Any problems with this phone lies with the Manufacture, NOT THE SELLERS)  So I'll say, Thank You Amazon for Your return policies and for Your understanding Sellers who gave me full refunds. I've had good luck with the Sellers I chose, but whenever possible I try to buy items that are Sold or Fulfilled by Amazon, That way it minimizes any risk when it comes to refunds. Remember if You buy from Amazon and it doesn't work you can always return it. So who knows, You may be one of those who say the phone works great. The question is, ""Are You feeling Lucky?""

B004SBJHW4,A34OJWGNJAOPUZ,"A. Jones ""Andy""","[0, 0]","The Atrix 4g boasts an impressive set of features, solid performance with it's snappy dual-core processor, and great battery life (I've had it run for 5 hours straight with streaming music and GPS tracking both going).Unfortunately, the software on this phone is extremely both buggy.  In the 6 months I've owned this device I've had to perform (at the insistence of Motorola tech support) 5 full factory resets due to software issues (random crashes, loss of data, phone wouldn't boot, etc).  I did not 'root' the phone, 'sideload' any apps, or perform any other questionable installations, I just ran the stock device.In addition to the software problems, the hardware of the atrix is very unreliable.  I'm actually on my 4th device, having returned 3 already under Warranty.  I'm very concerned about what will happen when my warranty runs out.  The first phone would not operate with the Atrix specific accessories (car dock, laptop dock, television dock) and there was no software resolution, so the phone had to be returned.  The 2nd would randomly reset itself to factory default, causing me to lose all my information.  The 3rd would only play any sounds (calls, music, etc) if I squeezed it very tightly (loose connection?).As a side note to the warranty returns and software issues, Motorola support is terrible terrible terrible!  I cannot stress this enough.  The FIRST thing they have me try when calling is a factory reset (loss of all data).  I have to work my way up to a 2nd or 3rd manager before they attempt any software solutions other than just reset the phone.  Secondly, despite the device being under warranty Motorola would not accept my returns for the hardware issues unless I paid them for the repair/replacement of the device.  I contacted AT&T; about the problems and they took care of it immediately even though Motorola is supposed to resolve warranty issues.As a second side note, addressing the Atrix specific docks that were supposed to be a huge selling point of this phone.  The docks, when they work, perform admirably.  I've owned all 3 at this point.  They integrate well, work the way they're supposed to, and are a great addition to the phone.  Unfortunately they will work only with this phone, ever, and if you ever upgrade your device they can go in the garbage can.  Motorola has changed the layout of their docking connections for more recent phones, and because of that I would consider these accessories a waste of money.  Go with more generic docks that will work for any android device.Finally, this device was/is advertised as being compatible with Android OS 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS).  However, despite using that as a selling point for the Atrix and several other devices, Motorola recently announced that they are cancelling their support and this phone will no longer be receiving ICS.The Atrix had the potential to be a great device, all the features are there, but the software, warranty, and (especially) support issues make this a phone to avoid.",2.0,1350518400,"10 18, 2012","Motorola Atrix 4G MB860 Unlocked GSM Phone with Android 2.2 OS, Dual Core, 5MP Camera, GPS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth - Black",96.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LRjjUblVL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2952},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

From day one I felt like it was a fight with this phone. Battery life is dismal. Daily reboots. The phone began to freeze on phone calls and camera gallery. I had to do a factory reset in January just to get phone function back.Finally I went back to Nokia and got the Lumia. No problems and easy to use since day one. Most of my apps from Android were on WP. See, yes you have access to more Android apps, but most are useless, and this dual core phone can't handle too many apps anyway. All this power and you can't really do much.But I do love the Atrix for one thing (well, two).The docks!!!!I have the car dock and with all my music on a 32g sd card I am happy. I use PowerAmp as my player (Motorola stock anything is useless). Great mp3 player!!! Great sound.I have the multimedia dock connected to my Tv and I can watch YouTube or surf the web or use my apps or use it as a clock or mini stereo. Very handy!! This is the true beauty of Atrix ownership. I don't use it as a phone anymore but can do everything thru Wi-Fi.I have a standard dock too for mini stereo at work and charging.

I Highly recommend NOT to buy the at&t; unlocked version, it's better to get the european factory unlocked cellphone. Away from that point, it really is an amazing machine. It gets almost no lag even though you have every screen with multiple live widgets, It's a monster when it comes to storage capability, with its default internal 16gb, it can be expanded 32gb more with a microSD card, making it a 48gb cellphone. It can be customized with either the android widgets or with the motoblur ones. Motoblur sometimes is a little messy, but it will become a powerful tool once you get the hang of it. It has a 5MP camera with dual led (the flashlight app is a blinding light!) gets quite good pictures.If you want a phone that can be your great storage ace, this is it.

Also if you want a secure phone, the biometric lector for the fingerprint works just fine, and will make your phone a mobile fortress.

I've dropped it quite a few times (never over 5 foot drops) and it has never come apart/restarted/cracked the screen.All of the applications and games I've thrown at it work flawelessly, no staggering or lags at all, whenver the phone starts to lag it's generally from a lack of signal. The Atrix also has no qualms about playing 720p video files which is a nice upgrade from my previous phone.I can usually get 1.5 days out of a charge, this varies depending on if I use the internet heavily or talk a lot.The camera is decent, it's not going to amaze given what else is on the market now - but it's a very competent camera nonetheless.One bad thing I can report on this phone is it will restart sometimes of its own accord. This is generally when you tap out the RAM by having too many apps running at a time or an app that gets stuck and has a memory leak.Things I like:-Responsive-Thin Design-Amount of apps that can be run at the same time-Media options (micro-HDMI port and media server options)-Good call volume-Decent battery life-Durable (construction isn't easy on electronics)-Forward facing cam (great for video conferencing)Things I don't like:-Random Restarts-Position of unlock button (personal preference)-Camera shutter speed can lag at timesOverall I really have liked this phone.

B004SBJHW4,A1901NTE8LFJF6,"Thomas M. Taylor ""runman""","[141, 160]","When I first saw the Atrix, I was mesmerized and had to wait a few months to get my hands on the phone. The specs of the Atrix is awesome and I have hope that the phone will live up to the promise that has been made. I have never used an Android phone before this one, but have used the Iphone since it came out and have the Iphone 4. I have used the Palm III, treo, BlackBerry ect... you get the point.What comes with the phone? You get the phone, USB cord, A wall plug and the HDMI cable, instruction manual and battery. Everything one need to step off into the Atrix Android world.One thing the iPhone user will notice that the Android software is more difficult to use. It may take a few hours just to get the basics down, but after the few hours a whole new world starts to open up. Unlike the Iphone who's software is easy to operate, the more you learn about Android, the more powerful the phone becomes.Just a quick comparison Iphone 4 VS Atrix, the Iphone 4 display is way clearer and the screen is a little more responsive. The Artix has a user replaceable battery and the phone can be taken a part and fix for a lot less money than the Iphone. Now, I have never tried to take apart either phone, but the instructions and professional review of the taken down is on line.One thing I would like to say is that the finger print reader works very well.The world of Apps...In Apps, Apple wins. Not much else to say there. The Apps that I use mostly are iHeart Radio (does not work on Atrix), Scrabble (Not found on Android store), Farkle (Android has but quality is lacking), Bloomberg and Fox News.Wall Paper...Android leaves Apple in the dust. The active wall paper cannot be beat by apple, you can have multiple home screens with live wall paper. I love knowing the time, temperature and forcast. If you are like me, the Android system, cannot be beat.Ease of use...Apple is a lot simpler to use. Just like pen and paper is easy, but if you are in the computer world, than a pen and paper just won't due, and this is where the Android system comes in. I cannot honestly say which system is best, Android or IOS. If you want simple, but lacking power, Iphone is the way. If you are a person who likes to play, Android is the choice.Display:The display is bright and colorful, but the diplay is not nearly as nice as the iPhone 4. The lack luster display is noticed especially noticed when reading texts and PDFs.Camera and Flash:The camera takes pretty good pictures. The LED flash works really good. I was able to take a picture in a nearly dark room and the subject came out clear and in focus. The LED flash filled the entire room. As a side note, there is a forward facing camera. I have not used and more than likely won't.Speaker:Very loud and clear when using to make calls, talk radio and listening to music. It is a small speaker so you will not get a lot (if any) bass from this little speaker.Operating System:I have never used Android before, so I have ability to describe between the Android, the Moto Blur, and if ATT messed it up I can't tell. The user of the Atrix must use the one app store that ATT backs, and the icon for the store comes preloaded. It would be nice to have more access to more stores, like Amazon, but if you get this phone, you are going to be stuck. The few apps that I have downloaded all seem to work fine and most of them were free. It would be nice it ATT did not pull the apple store garbage with this phone though.The Atrix comes loaded with lots of software, commonly known as bloatware, but you get a lot of it. The software that runs on the computer is called ""Motorola Media Link"", this is kind of like ""iTunes"" in the sense that the Media Link software is a way for your computer to communicate with the Atrix. This nifty program will take you itunes music (Not DRM protected) and place the music on your new phone. You can also transfer your pod casts too. The Media Link is automatic and does not need to be messed with. I had no problems with the installation or use of the software. The Software is stored on your phone and will try to load on any computer that the Atrix is hooked up to.Some of the really things about the Atrix that I like is the Micro SD slot (32BG max) for added memory and the user can remove the battery without having to go find apple support. I was also able to keep my unlimited data package, although a lot of AT&T; customers have not been so lucky. AT&T; also offers their $5.00/ month warranty on the phone as compared to the Iphone, and you do not have to hook the phone up to a computer the first time you use it. You do need to sign up for a MOTO account, nut it only takes a few seconds and you are able to use you new cell phone.Things I do not like. I do not like the feel of the phone. My Iphone 4 feels better constructed and feels like it will not easily slip out of my hands, unlike the Atrix. I have not yet dropped the phone. The battery seems to take a long while to receive a charge too.Big minus for the phone is the Lap top that you can purchase with the phone. I cannot see why I should spend 400.00 for the ""dock"" that is nothing but an empty screen. And then you have to pay ATT and extra ten per month for ""tethering"" the dock that is nothing but a screen to you phone. The price is too high for the extra ten you have to pay per month. You can can get a netbook that has more power and does more things for the same price.Why did I give the Atrix only 4 stars? The Atrix is a good phone, but the lack luster construction of the phone and the steep learning curve do not make up for the other great features that the phone has to offer.With the construction set aside, you cannot just load apps on your new phone. Like Apple, you can only purchase your apps from the included application on the phone. One reason for me gettig rid of my Iphone was the Apple store that you have to use. Well, thanks to AT&T;, the owners ofthe Atrix are stuck too. You cannot side load applications eigther. A real star looser for me.Update: 02/28/2011:I have now used the Atrix for a few days so it was prudent to give an update.Battery life:The battery life is not to great. After getting the battery at 100%, I then took the Atrix to chuch where I used Bible Reader app as my bible. At the end of Sunday school and main service, the phone was down to 60%, after the evening service, the phone was down to 10%. Lack luster battery life is normal. The Iphones have poor battery life, and the Atrix bettery life is even shorter. There is a lot of heat build up during use and when charging. The phone charges slowly when charging from a computer USB with the display off, and does not charge at all it seems with the diplay on. I purchased a Micro USB car charger and it works wonderfully.GPS Function:I do not use the AT&T; navigation, but the ""Navigation"" function that comes with the phone. The Android device does a wonderful with the GPS. Apple's GPS function and mapping capabilty always made the Apple Iphone a lst choice in trying to use as a GPS. The Android does a very good job with GPS, it is not on the level with a stand alone Garmen, but I do use a GPS alot to find customer houses and I would not hesitate to use the Atrix as my main GPS device. The GPS also has an option to use voice for the inputing of an address. It does work faily well, but the voice input for a destination (restraunt name)does not work as well.When traveling to your destination, you can turn the screen of the GPS off and you will still get voice commands. If you are using the media player function through your cars stereo system, the music will mute and the directs will come through your car speakers.DLNA ServicesIf you are like me, you have tons of videos sitting on your hard drive or network attached storage. The Atrix will find the media and play the media. I was able to stream several videos of differing formats with no problems at all. Honestly, I really do not think you will be uising the device as a 3"" television set, but it does work. Apple does the same thing, but you must have iTunes and/or AppleTV.A nifty little function that I have notice after owning the phone for several weeks, the DLNA service will try and link to your home media server where you are within the range of your ""in house"" network..Ring Tones:You can use and song or sound loaded on your phone as a ringtone. Easy to use, and it is free.Update 3/9/2011I tried to get Netflix on the phone and much to my surprise, Netflix does not have an App for the Android devices yet. So as an Atrix user, I am stuck paying an extra ten dollars to AT&T; for their TV service. According to sources on the internet, Android will have an App adventually but it will be a marketed to new phones. You will see the phones labeled as ""Nextflix compatable"". BummerUpdate 03/16/2011Phone is still owrking great. Had to turn the phone off and then back on yesterday. For some reason the phone would not update web based apps like stock market, bloomberg and weather. Turning the phone on and off solved the problem. I also purchased the otterbox defender for the Atrix... sweet phone case.The Atrix does appear to have better reception when placing calls. i could not make a phone call at my work using the Iphone 4 but no problems with the Atrix.Update 3/23/2011Took the phone on a trip of several hundred miles to see how the GPS would function, the phone did a great job. The phone did stop responding when trying to accomplish several tasks quickly. I was not able to turn the phone off to reset the phone. I actually had to take the battery out. You can look at that problem as a possitive and negative. The battery had to be removed to reset the phone, but at least the battery is user accessible unlike the iPhone.The phone was plugged into the 12 volt power in the car, no problems with the phone over heating or even the phone filling warm to the touch.I am pleased to announce that iHeart radio now works.4/3/2011 UpdateI have updated the firm ware in the Atrix to 4.1.57 a couple days ago. The firmware update does help a lot with the battery not lasting. I can now get 1.5 days of use out of a full charge instead of having to monitor the battery constantly, and keeping the Atrix plugged in while at work.ATT bandwidth problem is still there and the radio inside the Atrix is still disconnected thanks to ATT, but the update coming in April is supposed to fix those issues.4/21/2011 Update:Still waiting for the AT&T; update that is coming out this month. Phone is working wonderful. No major problems.If you read the complete summary above, you may notice that I included that the phone feels like it would easily slip from my hands. The phone has on several occasions slipped from my hands, but i have been able to catch the phone before it plunged to the floor. Good thing I have the AT&T; warranty.I did some side by side tests to see if the Iphone was faster loading/running programs than the Atrix. The Iphone maybe a little faster. I have run into CPU speed issues with the Iphone 4 that I have not seen in the Atrix. So my conclusion on the speed of the phone CPUs with launching and running application is this; while the Iphone does appear to launch programs faster most of the time, but running the programs (apps), the Atrix appears to be a constant and steady winner. When Android 2.3 comes out it should make better use of the dual core processor.",4.0,1303862400,"04 27, 2011","Motorola Atrix 4G MB860 Unlocked GSM Phone with Android 2.2 OS, Dual Core, 5MP Camera, GPS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth - Black",96.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LRjjUblVL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2952},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

I believe in yesterday's technology when it is still good. This is. It does everything the new phone of today do. Only issue I have - and I've reaad about it in many reviews - is the camera. It is very slow to respond. But that is not why I have it. I have a good DSLR and it doesn't bother me that the camera in my phone is not that great.Everything else works wonderfully. Great reception....I can hear and be heard well. It finds my wireless very quickly. Lots (LOTS) of options in the settings menu. It is extremely highly customizable. There are seven (7) home pages to set up whatever you may need. I have it set up as one with my calendar, another with music/radio apps, another with oft used numbers, another with a sticky note and one with photos, one with navigation and map stuff and the last with misc apps including my Siri-like helper (works great by the way).The battery isn't great, but it lasts all day. I am used to charging it each night. I bought a second battery so it's there if I do need it.Get a case of some sort (even though it's a pretty device, you need to cover it) - and a screen protector. I have two different types of cases I got here on Amazon (the battery too). I also suggest you get a Bluetooth if you don't already have one - pairing is simple and fast.But back to the Droid X - it is great. I love my phone and use it for many things all day, every day. The fact that it is larger than most other phones is nice. I can see better with the extra real estate. Carrying it is no bother if you have the right case.

The apps are the same as any other iTunes apps and the calls are never dropped. This has been a great phone on trips using it for navigation.

There were a couple of times it could not find signal so we had to use a real map, but that was because there were less Verizon towers in the places we went. I was still amazed we had any signal.

Since I still did not want to tack on extra $$ for data (especially since I get data on my iPad = $60/month just for 2 devices to be on data!) I bought a phone the salesman told me was a &#34;great texting phone&#34;.  This turned out to be very false as the phone was extremely slow and lagged constantly.  Then Verizon introduced the new pricing feature making it much more affordable for my family to have data.  So I was on the prowl for a better prepaid phone that I could replace my p.o.s. with.  I stumbled upon this baby.  I've had it a few days and its incredible!  I love it!  So happy I bought it.  Now would I be this thrilled if I owned an iPhone 5 or a more recent droid?  Probably not but since I was upgrading from a non smart phone this thing is incredible to me.  I really love apple, but didn't want to put out the $$ for a used beat up iPhone 4.  I'm actually enjoying this more than I think I would an iPhone!One thing to be aware of:  I bought this phone &#34;new&#34; and it certainly looks and performs that way.  I doubt it was actually new but the company certainly made sure it looked nice.  I can't complain about that.  I also bought a sandisk 32 gb sdhc card &#34;frustration free packaging&#34;.

B0052TQ4FY,A3B1360JOYS0GJ,AccioFirebolt,"[91, 95]","I don't understand all of the negative reviews for this phone. I noticed that some of the reviews are rating the seller they bought it from instead of the phone itself which isn't fair for this product.This was my first smartphone. I chose this one for the full keyboard. Let me tell you, this phone lasted a full 18 months until my next contract extension and then I was able to resell it to a friend and it's still going strong for him.Let me say the only problems I had with this phone. Firstly, it froze and/or powered off then powered itself back on a couple times a week. It wasn't a big deal for me. Just take the battery out if it ever freezes, put it back in, then restart it.Second problem is that the keyboard went ""wonky"" sometimes where it wouldn't type or wouldn't recognize inputs. After researching online, I was easily able to fix this problem. All you have to to is clear the cache. Go to Settings>Manage Apps>Keyboard&lt;then clear cache and that will solve your problem.Those are the only problems I had with this phone. I absolutely loved it. I also tried a Droid 2 Global and if you're given the choice, choose the Droid 2 instead because it is better unless you need the Global for international use.I love the full keyboard. Fast internet speeds. Easily connects to bluetooth. I was able to connect it to my computer via bluetooth which made sharing media between the 2 super easy. Ran all the apps that I downloaded.Let me recommend adding the Amazon MP3 app. I used it as my main music player because the user interface is better than the stock music player. You can add your entire music collection to your Amazon Cloud from your computer and it automatically sends them to the app on your phone which saves up tons of memory because the music is saved onto your Amazon account and not on your phone. Then when you get a new phone, you download the MP3 app to the new phone and all your music is right there. Very convenient. I literally have 2000 songs saved to my cloud so it's like having a iPod and phone all in one.Add the Amazon App Store application. You get a free paid app everyday so that I now have over 400 paid apps that I got for free easily saving me $1,000+ if I were to purchase those same apps. Like the MP3 app, the apps you download are saved to your Amazon account so that they will follow you from phone to phone which I can verify from having done it myself.And download a free browser app. I prefer the Dolphin browser but there are many other options including Firefox Mobile. The browser apps are better than the stock browser.So whatever problems other have had with the stock browser, music player, etc, etc, can be easily circumvented by following the tips I have given you. The firmware isn't great on any of the Droids I have had so far, including Droid X, X2, Droid 2 Global, and this phone. But by customizing the phone by using the app store, it's like customizing your home computer. I use Firefox browser instead of Internet Explorer on my laptop, for example.Any app that is giving you trouble, just go the the app in the settings, clear the cache, and chances are that will fix the problem. There are dozens of free touch keyboard options, too.How many electronic devices nowadays hold up over 18 months? Not many especially not smartphones but this one did. I loved it. I will continue to buy Droid phones for as long as I have cellphones. Very well made.Buy the extended battery. You will need it. Buy extra chargers for your car, work, etc, anywhere you will be using your phone.Finally, the Otterbox is the best case for this phone. I tried dozens. The screen on this phone has rounded corners so most of the cheapy cases will not fit because the screen piece pops off due to the odd shape.

My multimeter is not working, so I can't tell if it is the plug-in adapter that is not sending power, or if it is the dock that is not working, but either way it doesn't work.  Unfortunately, this is following a pattern of several motorola products I have owned, hence my skepticism in the original review.  Bummer, but at least I will hopefully be able to get a new one under warranty.This is a pretty neat dock.  It is very pricey, compared to the regular (non HD) dock, but the ability to hook it up to your widescreen TV is pretty cool, and the best part (reason I bought it) is that you can hook up USB peripherals.  I had my doubts about this USB feature, but I have 2 different wireless mouse/keyboard combos and both of them work flawlessly with this dock.  My laptop crapped out last week, and I had to research buying a new one using the bionic's webtop app (firefox browser), since I didn't have the laptop to surf with (obviously), and this worked great.  My new laptop should arrive in 3 or 4 days, but in the meantime, this will tide me over.  One big concern I have is the wall plug-in to this dock.  It is not the USB-type like the other docks I've had were.  This is a proprietary plug.  I assume they had to avoid a USB power source, as most USB sources don't have the amperage needed to power this thing, then everyone would return it as ""broken"" when their underpowered USB port fails to run the dock.  Anyway, the power connector is a tiny rod, smaller in diameter than a toothpick (by quite a bit), and it would not surprise me if that tip would snap off easily, so I try to be very careful when packing it into my luggage.

A MAJOR separator between the iphone series and the droid bionic is that the bionic can change battery packs while you are stuck with what apple gives you day one until it dies on the iphone. Having 2 sizes to choose from and both fitting inside the docks (both usb and a/v HDMI HD) was another great move on MOT's part.  But having more than one battery lying around means having to keep them charged - and you never want your phone tied up charging batteries do you?So you buy one of these.  Now there was a rumor it included a 10.2 Wh (high cap) battery but in fact it comes with the 6 Wh slim pack  - that's not the one I prefer, but its not bad to have 2 of them - the one that came with the phone and an extra.  My high cap battery came with the back.Motorola did it even better - the charger has a senser button to determine if you inserted the 6 or 10 watt-hour pack to customize the charge curve.  Lastly, it ships complete with an a/c charger, cord, and even a small 2"" long daisychain plug to go into your usb cradle or phone - thus saving you another ac adapter plug place.Well thought out, well made, works good.  I just wish it shipped with the 10wh battery instead of another slim cell - but I use the slim batteries and keep them at 100% charge anyways.This is a great setup and comes with a thin battery, a charger (included), and finally connects to the usb dock with the short cable...

It includes a unique charger set up as well which is not very well described or barely mentioned , ANYWHERE ! So let me start there . The car charger is a dual USB style port which plugs typically into your car's cigarette lighter/12V power outlet just like any other ordinary auto charger . Only this one includes a special cable which is actually 2 cables in 1 ! The 1st is the USB to micro USB used for power / charging of the phone but it actually says to NOT use with other chargers or household outlet style chargers  don't ask me why , thats just what it says  . It plugs large side into the plug going into your cars power outlet and the other (micro) into the cradle assembly . The 2nd cable is a mini phono style cable which connects to the plug in your cars power outlet and leads out approximatley 12-15 inches and then leads to your vehicles auxillary input jack  assuming you have one  , if you do great , this is simple neat and easy for you but if you don't , no worries , the cable section is removable and the external phone speaker works fantastically ! Or if your vehicles radio is BT compatible then you could use that method ;) All this bundles up nice and neat with an included velcro wrap up which is a nice lil' bonus too . As for the cradle , it's far nicer than the Motorola cradle for the orignal Droid which i also had and liked , this one will accept the phone out of the box stock or with the extended factory battery or with a variety of silicone sleeve/covers and even the extended battery with factory VERIZON shell/holster  what i currently use  and it works with them all securely and firmly and allows for full access to all features of your phone as well as buttons and controls and when docked in this cradle unlocks and opens a new auto/navi feature i've never seen or heard of anywhere else and i won't even go into just how awesome and sweet this added perk is . The cradle can be mounted to your windshield via the included suction cup mount which is what i use and prefer or inverted with the included plate which can be adhered anywhere in your vehicle . There are a variety of booklets , instructions and pamphlets also included with this kit one of which was a 15% off on your next VZW in store purchase which worked out nicely for me since i wanted that extended battery and of course an apprpriate cover/sleeve for said extended battery pack equipped phone .

B005C31G1W,A155IX5XBEH2Z4,USMCgunrock,"[1, 1]","Ok..so since I got my Bionic, I've been looking to find a car dock for it but didn't want to spend over $45 for one and instead went for a $5 one from Amazon.  The unit that I got worked in holding my phone in place but the problem was the ""arms"" that holds the phone covers the side buttons or the charging port and it was very bulky.  It still held the phone in place even when I was offroading, but just the fact that the phone was hanging on one side made me not use it much.Last week I saw this and purchased it for half the price it used to be...I was a bit skeptic because no where in the description mentioned about fitment with extended battery, with case and those that reviewed it gave it a 1 star rating cuz the case gets in the way of charging and what not.  For $25, I gave it a try.So, my Bionic has the standard Motorola plastic case/holster and extended battery.  IT FITS!! there is a sleeve on the cradle that you can take out to accommodate the extended battery and the case.  Since my case is already falling apart from getting dropped from work, I also ordered the Diztronic Matte Back Black Flexible for it at the same time.  Great case, btw, and was kinda worried cuz the case actually covers every side of the Bionic unlike the Motorola case.  I placed in on the dock...IT FITS!!My impression of the dock?  I love it! I always use my phone as my GPS since I travel a lot for work, going from one job site to another and then taking it with me during my weekend outings.  I drive a Jeep (I mention this cuz unlike other cars, my windshield doesn't sit far forward) and how I mount it on the windshield I have no problems with it.  It has held in place even through rough terrain maybe because where it's mounted, it also rest on the dash.  I've also seen a 1 star rating cuz of their phone's GPS was not working in landscape or portrait mode....MINE DOES! so ***** !In conclusion, I think this is a very good dock (well, it is made specifically for the phone) and it was a good $25 investment.

This voids the Amazon refund policy as the product is now used not new. But this would also mean it is defective. Product support and custormer service are not on the same page and the shipping vendor my be selling products they know will not activate. To get an RMA or a refund can take 4-8 weeks if at all. This is a do not buy from third parties. I am not sure I would recommend Virgin Mobile online store. It is still being escallated to  the ""headquarters"" in New Jersey. I am going to the Apple store tomorrow to find two new phones.Without activation this is just very glorified and very expensive mp3 player.",3.0,1314748800,"08 31, 2011",Motorola Triumph Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile),148.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41afT9O27oL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 27145},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"
B005DTSBEU,ASLSSSI5XUMJR,"Amazon Customer ""Patrick Justus""","[87, 93]","The Motorola Triumph is a thing of beauty and comes closest to the handheld device I've been dreaming of.  Ever since the days of the Palm T/X I've longed for a versatile PDA that could also make phone calls in a pinch. Using Wi-Fi to communicate makes so much more sense to me. Since then, I've watched communication devices increasingly become locked down money makers. (I get that you love your idroid, or whatever, but for me, I just don't see the value of paying a hundred bucks a month for what I always had for practically free.)So for me, the biggest advantage of the Triumph is the very reasonable cost of ownership thanks to Virgin Mobile.  VM has cut their service to the bone, but like other savvy tech providers, has set up a mechanized operation that works on its own.  If you need help from Virgin, as a general rule for tech, stay away from the phone line and go to the forums, or use email.  Virgin Mobile Facebook is all you need to get over the hump of confusion caused by new adoption.I have had no problems with the Triumph once I got dialed in.  The signal matches my LG Optimus V and both data and calls are clear even indoors in my suburb digs.  The Triumph has a larger screen, easier to use data entry, longer battery life, and a front facing camera for those ""free"" video chat calls.  All of that makes it worth the initial cost to me.  Once the setup (rather challenging at times) is over, it all works like a champ.Thanks to Motorola, Google, and Virgin, my dream of a handheld device that doesn't make me feel like I'm being gouged by the big providers has been comfortably sublimated.  Every time I pick up the Triumph, I feel like I'm sending another kind of message: a wake-up call to the big providers.

I took off the stock screen protector and that has improved the sensitivity quite a bit. I'm a heavy user so it needs charging once every maybe 8-12 hours, depending on how much I use it. I have ordered an extended 1600 mAh battery for it so it should last quite a bit longer.I also have rooted this phone as well as flashed the MIUI ROM and kicked up the processor to 1.5 ghz. I consistently score between 2600-2900 on Quadrant (although Quadrant scores don't realistically reflect everyday use performance, it should be seen as more of an idea of your phone's performance) but the scores hang with high end contract phones.Overall I am extremely pleased with this phone and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality prepaid phone.I believe this phone paired with Virgin's phone plans are the best bang for your buck.",5.0,1332115200,"03 19, 2012",Motorola Triumph Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile),148.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41afT9O27oL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 27145},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"
B005DTSBEU,A30HTH72XPYK33,Chris B. Hirner,"[1, 3]","On paper this phone is just great. As for day to day use it reminds me of driving a classic car.  It looks great and can really work well, but the constant need for tinkering and workarounds is exhausting.  Just little things just dont seem to work right and when you put them all together the overall experience for the phone is just too much trouble.  The screen looks great at full brightness but lower levels get a little washed out.  The screen sensitivity is just annoying at best because its constantly changing.  One minute it will pick up the slightest touch then the next your rolling your finger around trying to find the best spot.  I never had the bad problems that some report.  No random restarts or bad audio. The bluetooth shuts off when the phone goes to sleep which is really confusing and made my headset useless unless i was activly on a call or listening to a podcast.  The gps seems not to have any Agps support. it will lock but not until it can download the entire gps almanac (about 2 minutes). Its just long enough so its not practical for the maps app, works fine for the navigation though.If music is playing and a system sound comes on the phone lowers the music which is fine, but then it never turns it back up.  so you gotta stop the song then restart to reclaim the volume.I checked with motorola and virgin mobile to see if there was an update coming they  responded as usefully as a preprinted email macro can be. the typical check the forums junk.  It really seems like they got a good deal on some unbranded hardware, threw together a rom as cheap as possible,payed motorola to put their name on it and didnt spend alot of time testing.  Heck i dont need the gingerbread os, i would settle for a simple update fix.Many people experience a low signal on the phone which is is odd as well.  If you compare the dbm readings in the system status compared to other phones it should show one more bar most of the time.In conclusion it had potential but between a phone with issues pointing to an unpolished rom build and a very spotty network.

B005DTSBEU,A3GFQHHVMEAIO,Danny K,"[102, 108]","First I've been an Amazon reviewer reader and writer for many years! I use Amazon because I know the reviews are from real people like myself and I can tell from these reviews if a product is a problem. Now as a Virgin Mobile Samsung Intercept owner I wanted to upgrade and this large thin screen with a 1ghz processor seemed like a no brainer, so I read the reviews and what? There are many 5 star and many 1 star reviews....this confused me, but knowing that that is most always a 30 day money-back guarantee with the Virgin mobile phones I took my Amazon discounted Motorola Triumph page to my local Bestbuy electronics store and they matched the price! So if I may I would like to go into a quick past with my old Virgin mobile Samsung intercept for a second....I purchased the Samsung Intercept and had all sorts of problems, I upgraded the system operating system and with the correct apps made the Samsung a very stable smart phone but slow. I was pleased, but after a year and seeing that Virgin Mobile has a new DROID X phone called the Motorola Triumph I had to go for it. The Motorola phone size is thin, sturdy, beautiful screen and fast, in fact compared to the Samsung, super fast. The memory to run programs is about 1gb. This is just for programs!!! Everything works perfectly, Blue-tooth on my car, wifi, mp3 player,(I'm using power amp app which is fantastic)for videos I added the MX player app which is a must to play HD videos, speaking of HD videos/pictures the camera has a flash and takes perfect pictures and the camcorder can take 1280x 720 videos!  2x free app is a must for saving the battery draw. The 3G speed is about 3 times the Samsung Intercept, the screen is larger than an Iphone and super thin and the detail on the screen is just like my friends HTC fancy large android phone. I checked and my phone software ends in .39  Maybe if you check the one stars on this phone you will their software ends in .38  I don't know the difference and I don't care. I love this phone and I can tell you the reason people are complaining about the battery life is because this phone is so fast, so bright, so detailed and holds so many apps its hard to put it down and shut the screen off!!!!  In conclusion, I would like to point out that I did have a problem with the GPS starting time, so I did much reading and loaded the free GPS tester app on the phone (free on the market) and now I can run the tester if there is a problem and see the satellite signal etc and when I switch to the navigator GPS on the phone it shines!! This is the best Virgin Mobile Phone on the market! I'm one  still on the #25 dollar plan. BTW use superbox app, it does everything you need.PROS:Fast,runs every app I can throw at itVery bright screen and very detailedMemory for holding and running apps is 1gb (great)Memory for running the processor is 200mb or moreProcessor speed is 1gb  (fast)Pictures and Videos are fantastic taking and playing (set to high)Camera flash works wellCase is well designed with a rubber none slip feel and very thinCons:Battery life drains faster than I would like1. because the phone can not be put down!!!!2. Use the battery saver apps like 2x battery or others.IF you have a problem with the GPS starting,try running the free GPS tester app first.UPDATE:Everything above still stands. I also found the black Empire kit that Amazon sells with the pouch, car charger and AC charger to be a must. Also the phone comes with the side power button programmed to drop cellphone calls. You can unprogram this in settings. This is a must for me because I was cancelling my calls while taking the phone out of the pouch. I also downloaded the super keyboard app and it works better for emailing /texting on the screen. This phone is now my emailer, texter, mp3 player, camcorder, camera, flashlight, gaming device, newspaper reader, weather monitor, GPS (better than a garmin) my calculator, VM Minutes monitor, barcode reader,google voice search and much more anyone who gives this phone a one star is crazy, this is the best VM smartphone to date!UPDATE: April 2012 all above stands, except this phone does take a while to connect to the GPS signal and I now found that the fastest way to connect to GPS is to run the App GPS Status and toolbox. It is better than GPS tester and seems to help the phone connect to the GPS signal faster also I'm now using the GPS app Waze...wow Great GPS to Traveling...Try it!UPDATE: August 2012 all the above still stands. Love this phone. I noticed that Virgin mobile is now selling the HTC Evo 3d with 4G and a 1.2 ghz dual core processor. Then I looked at the PC mag reviews and the Amazon reviews and it appears that the HTC Evo 3g has problems receiving phone calls and texting. Too bad, I was ready to upgrade. PC Mag also says the Motorola Triumph is the best smartphone on virgin mobile to date. I agree!UPDATE: September 2012 Because I was frustrated that this phone took too long to connect to the gps satellites, I went to my local radio shack store and purchased the new Virgin Mobile HTC Evo 3D 4G phone. Radio Shack gives a 30 day money back guarantee, so how could I go wrong? It is noticeably faster than the Triumph but has a glich with texting. Glad I don't text much.

B005DTSBEU,A1ICWJAM8Z14BD,gadgetjunkie,"[1, 1]","I've always been hesitant to use a pre-paid carrier because the selection of phones left a lot to be desired.  However, this phone with it's 1Ghz snapdragon processor is finally a good replacement for the HTC Evo I've been using for the last 18 months.  I won't say that it's perfect, but I have about 90% of the functionality of the EVO and a cell phone bill that is more than half off the monthly amount I used to pay.The major downside of the Triumph is that there aren't any extended batteries available yet.  The EVO battery life wasn't great either, but I purchased a Seidio Innocell 3500 mAh Extended-Life Battery which doubled the battery life of the EVO, so I could use it all day.  The Triumph really has to be charged at least once during the day to make it through an entire day.Also, I've received some feedback from people I've called that the speakerphone isn't as clear on the Triumph as it was on my EVO.Other than those two issues, the phone has performed very well.  I did experience some random reboots on the first couple of days, but I haven't seen that happen since then.To remedy the battery life issue (and until there's a better option available), I just purchased aNew Trent iCruiser IMP1000 11000mAh External Battery Pack and Charger for iPad2, iPad, iPhone 4S 4 3Gs 3G (AT&T; and Verizon), iPod Touch (1G 2G 3G 4G 5G), HTC Android EVO, Blackberry, Samsung Galaxy S, Droid, Nintendo, Sony PSP and much more, which I've read will give up to a week of use on a phone like this.UPDATE: I returned my phone to Amazon today and replaced it with an LG Optimus Slider.  The LG Optimus Slider specs aren't anywhere near as good as the Motorola Triumph and the screen is smaller, but at least it's reliable.  I've only returned a handful of products to Amazon over the years, so for me to return this phone, it had to be bad.  The main problems I found are as follows:1. Random reboots.  The phone just reboots itself sometimes for no reason at all.  I was able to live with this because it wasn't that bad, even though it was annoying.2. Speakerphone microphone isn't clear, so callers are unable to hear you clearly when using speakerphone.  I always used speakerphone on my Evo, but never could use it on the Triumph, so I opted for bluetooth instead (see below)...3. Bluetooth is unreliable.  I tried to give this phone the benefit of the doubt literally for 2 weeks.  I was using an older Jawbone Prime, so I figured, maybe the bluetooth was randomly disconnecting because I needed to upgrade.  So, I purchased the Jawbone ICON from Amazon - same issue.  Then I purchased the LG bluetooth headset and same problem.  Turns out that bluetooth issues with this phone are a known issue.  If you google Motorola Triumph Bluetooth Issues, you'll see what I mean.  I was hoping there was a fix out there; I even considered rooting, but found out that there's no way around this issue.  Bluetooth will work for awhile (maybe 1 or 2 calls) and then won't work again until you turn off bluetooth in settings and turn it back on.  The bluetooth issue is what prompted me to return the phone.  I've been using the LG Optimus Slider for just a day now and it is so nice not having to worry about whether my bluetooth will work on the next call.4. Battery life is awful.  I was going to try living with this.  I know battery life on smartphones in general is not that great.  I'd hoped there would be an extended battery available for this phone eventually, but the phone just simply couldn't go more than 12 hours without a recharge.  Admittedly, I spend a lot of time on the phone, but my Evo could keep up with me and the Triumph couldn't.",1.0,1325635200,"01 4, 2012",Motorola Triumph Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile),148.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41afT9O27oL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 27145},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"

I thought it was because I needed to try different headsets.  I thought a lot of things, when what I should have thought was ""Oh my God, this phone is horrible.""  I figured it out too late to return it.  I spent almost two months trying to use by ordering headsets, apps, and learning new ways to sync and backup my music and data.  Don't make my mistake.Cons:1.  Bluetooth will not stay connected.  If you use bluetooth, you will be grossly disappointed.  This is a known issue, thousands of complaints.2. Phone often reboots and sometimes just shuts down without you knowing about it.  Known issue, thousands of complaints.3.  No program to sync it with.  Motorola didn't revise their syncing program so this phone could use it.  You must use your ingenuity and several different programs to load and maintain your data and music.  If you aren't comfortable storing all of your information online in your Google Mail account, you are out of luck.4.  Battery cover doesn't ""snap"" in place, it just slides up over the battery.  If falls off when you pull the phone out of your pocket, and the battery falls out.5.  Phone and battery get very hot when searching for a signal6.  GPS, Navigator, and compass do not work.  This is a known issue, thousands of complaints.7. Battery runs down quickly.  Motorola put a battery in this phone that is undersized compared to most other phones.  There is no replacement battery with more juice.  Thousands of complaints.8. Touch screen freezes for no reason at times and battery must be removed to reset the phone....so if you bought a cover to keep the phone protected and to keep the battery cover on it, you are always taking it off to remove the battery and reset the phone.9.  3G is much slower than the 3G was on my AT&T; phone.  Yet, Sprint is supposed to have a better 3G system.  Maybe for Virgin Mobile they make it as slow as dialup.10.  No note-pad app came with it right out of the box, you must download one.11.  No % key on the calculator, you must download a different app to have one12.  Motorola doesn't list accessories that are compatible with it on their website, you must ""buy, try and return""13.  Motorola has not responded to the complaints about this phone by correcting the software or hardware issues.  It has been silent, and so has Virgin Mobile.The only pros:1.  It looks good2.  It has a large screen3.  It will keep your hand warm this winter when you hold it.  But I'll bet you can buy a very nice pair of gloves for a lot less to keep both hands warm.4.  You won't get fat from all the money you save or lose your voice from all the talking you can do on it.  You will end up having to save all that extra money to buy a phone that actually works.I should have titled this review:  ""The Triumph is the last Motorola Phone you will ever buy.""

The Camera on the Triumph is a 5mp one but the quality wasn't as great as it could have been. I can also record in 720p which i liked, the playback was a little laggy but that might have been because of the slow memory card preinstalled with the phone.

It runs smoothly and I'm happy about my purchase. Keeps up pretty well with a friend's Motorola Atrix, though it's certainly not faster.Alos, the build quality of this phone is top notch. Soft touch alround, Gorilla Glass front, metal back. And really quite slim. The biggest issue I have with the body is that the battery cover is almost too easy to get open - it sometimes comes off when I pull it out of my pocket. Though this is easily fixed with a case.Camera quality is great outdoors in even sunlight, but terrible most of the time indoors and in dark enviroments. The flash does help though. 720p video looks good on the screen, but not the best blown up. Again, it's much better outdoors in good, even sunlight. The front-facing camera, at VGA resolution, is crap. But still good for video chat. And the bonus of Gingerbread is that you can actually use it for video chat on Skype.The screen is gorgeous, bright, and crisp. It's no qHD, but it looks as good as the screen on the Droid 3 or Droid Bionic. At 4.1 inches it's a perfect size, and not so big as to make it an uncomfortable phone to hold.The biggest let down of this device is the battery life though. It is improved by CM7, but it's still a bit lacking. An extra batter and external charger solved the issue quite well, however.Some problems that CM7 solves are: screen flickering when waking device, random reboots, sound quality, it gives you Wi-Fi Hotspot support, and so many other things.

B005DTSBEU,A298UNWDQZFDUK,"Javier Rodriguez ""NothingInCommon""","[7, 8]","1) First triumph just died on me, the battery refused to charge so I had to return it.2) triumph #2 took unfocused pictures 100% of the time.3) triumph #3 would NEVER get a GPS lock. The triumph has by far the absolute worse GPS on any phone EVER. 20 out of 20 times  it would not achieve a GPS lock.4) triumph #4 same issue as #3. I imagine both the first 2 triumphs had the GPS lock issue as well, I just never tested it out.All four had horrible reception, apparently  its a single band radio who's frequency is less likely to penetrate indoors so the end result is a constant weak signal. You may think well its just your area, but no, I had the optimus V before this one and never had signal issues or GPS lock issues. There is a reason this prepaid phone is so inexpensive, and its not because they used the best parts to make it.This phone is absolutely horrendous. I don't understand how anyone in the right mind would give it anything more than 1 star.  It's well documented all over the internet how horrible it is. Motorola even had to delete the threads from their support forums to save themselves from the embarrassment.  My experience was during the first 3 weeks of the phones release so it's entirely possible that they have made adjustments to the hardware/software to fix all of the problems, but I doubt it.[...]",1.0,1320969600,"11 11, 2011",Motorola Triumph Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile),148.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41afT9O27oL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 27145},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"
B005DTSBEU,A2ZH4QB0DTHYJM,"Jeremy D. ""Jeremy""","[5, 5]","I should preface this review by informing you this is my first phone without a physical keyboard--I have always had flip, slider, candy bar, or Blackberry-like telephones with a T9 or Qwerty keyboard on it.  Needless to say, using a virtual keyboard takes some getting used to and I do text a lot but also needed a larger screen to view webpages and wanted to give Virgin Mobile a try after some disappointment with larger, more traditional providers.The Good: Virgin Pricing/BusinessVirgin does a great job of being a low-cost mobile carrier that appeals to a wide variety of consumers and utilizes a major network of cell towers (Sprint) that follows large cities and the US Interstate system.  Plans for this phone are $35 up to a modest $55/month for everything.  Data is unlimited but speed throttling starts at 2.5 GB/plan month (change occured in March 2012).  Set-up, number porting, and support is easily done through Virgin's telephone service or website.  (Unfortuantely the website does not have chat support, but holds are short or non-existant on their support line.)The Good: Camera/ScreenThis is by far the best camera I have purchased inside a phone.  The rear-facing 5MP camera (I have yet to use the flash or front-facing 3MP camera) takes incredibly clear photos and uploads them quickly to Facebook when attached to a 3G or greater data connection.  Daylight photos are astounding and it has some type of image stabilization that is the best I've seen in a small lens camera like this.  The screen is very clear and I can even read some webpages when they are displayed in a desktop-computer type view.  Controls are all on-screen, not sure if the side button can be programmed to act as shutter.  Pinch/Expand is quick to respond as well.The Good: Processor and AudioI've used this phone at my office and in my car to stream Pandora digital music and it handles the app and reproduces audio beautifully through it's headphone jack to an aux audio cord for my car stereo or through earbuds.  The speakerphone is average and not a good music player but serves its purpose adequately for calls.The Good: DurabilityI've had this phone for a month and while I haven't put it through rigerous paces, it can withstand a short drop (hand to counter) and has a slightly rubberized case for shock-resistance and ease of grip.  The surface is Corning Gorilla Glass so it is unlikely it will crack or scratch.  The four ports (micro HDMI Out, Micro USB charge/data, and 3.5 mm headphone jack) are uncovered and reasonably simple to keep clean.The Good: AppsThis phone will support almost any app on the Android Market/Google Play, I have yet to come accross one that refuses to install due to incompatibility and Verizon doesn't load on too many that are unnecessary.The Bad: AppsFacebook's App (Ver 1.8.4 for Android) really hates this phone.  I've used that version successfully on older phones and it doesn't have critical failures like it does on the Motorola Triumph.  No damage to the phone or other applications, but it will close instantly when trying to load Facebook for no visible reason.The Bad: Coverage/WiFi compatibilityI live in a metropolitain area and believed there would be good coverage; unfortunately I am in a brick building and the network Virgin uses is Sprint-only (not their affiliates), so only a few area towers are accessible but this device overcomes that dilemma by using my WiFi network.  Unfortunately I can't find a good VOIP application and unlike my old Motorola, this one does not have it installed or I can't locate the mode.  The result is I can get quick internet inside my apartment using my WiFi network but when a call is coming, I need to lean out the window--with the weak cellular connection the phone keeps detaching/re-joining my wireless network which is frustrating for sending text messages or using data.The Bad: Something every phone should haveEvery manufacturer who puts a ""flash""/high intensity LED on the back of their phone should keep a ""flashlight"" app/button to give you 15 seconds- a minute of light while dimming the display to make it easy to find things in the dark.  I know it drains battery fast--everyone does, but we want this feature!!!The Ugly: As with all smartphones, battery technology hasn't kept up with power-hungry processors and displays and like all phones, this one will not maintain power on standby for a full 24 hours without recharging.  Motorola should know we'd gladly carry around a phone 2mm thicker with an extra 2 ounces of weight if it could hold a charge longer than a day!Bottom line: This phone is a good start for Virgin Mobile to carry an Android phone and the price point is appropriate but there are a few improvements needed in this model as well as the Virgin network before it can satisfy customers used to the coverage and handsets offered by traditional cellular carriers.",3.0,1333411200,"04 3, 2012",Motorola Triumph Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile),148.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41afT9O27oL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 27145},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"
B005DTSBEU,A1ZU55TM45Y2R8,J. Haggard,"[43, 54]","I have been a user of the Virgin Mobile Optimus V phone for the last few months. As a former iPhone 3G customer I was impressed to see such a snappy device on a no-contract plan. Well a few months later Virgin announced the Motorola Triumph. After a few weeks of hesitation I went out and bought it for $299 from my local best buy.  Not even 48 hours later it's been boxed back up and is going back. I've reactivated my old Optimus V and will stick with that one.What's wrong with the Motorola Triumph?1. QualityThe build quality isn't bad. In fact it meets my expectations for the most part. I have zero issues with the design of the battery cover, the buttons, etc. My issue is with the light leak and this is the most minor of my complaints. You can see where the screen is held onto the frame because on the bottom of the screen there are 2 points where you can see a gap and light coming through around the screen. This is minor, but when I tried out the netflix app I found it distracting.2. Touch / ResponsivenessThis is the #1 reason this phone is going back. My phone (wonder if it's all) has serious lag problem when you scroll through the app drawer. At first it's ok, but if you scroll all the way down and then back up and let it sit for a second to find the app you want you'll find that the phone locks up for a few seconds and is unresponsive. This is a STOCK phone with only the standard default apps. Then as you browse through the phone the back button at the bottom of the screen is often unresponsive and requires several pushes. At times I had to push the power button to turn the phone off and back on to get the screen to respond. Personally I've never had this type of issue with the Optimus V or my iPhone which leads me to believe this is either poor design or a software flaw.3. Customer ServiceThis is a problem, I haven't actually called Motorola but in searching to see if my phone was defective Sunday or not I came across Motorola's official support forums. In there I found a thread where a customer found that his version of the phone came with firmware ending in .38, other people however had .39. When he posted a question on how does he upgrade the response from Motorola was poor to say the least. In fact if you go to motorola's website and try to use their device update tool the Triumph isn't even a supported phone, there is no way to download the new firmware and even OTA updates say the package is missing. A few weeks back the question was asked when would current users on the .38 get the .39 update, and WHAT was in that update? The response from Motorola was ""we will try to find out the difference in the firmware"". I think this should be posted clearly on the motorola site saying new firmware is avaialble and here's what it fixes. Not hide the fact they released a new version and some phones come with it, some phones don't and if it doesn't you can't get it.... So then the question was asked when would it be available and below is the response:Motorola: We are currently investigating the difference between the two software versions. As soon as we have information I will share it with you.Customer (5 days after previous post): What is the ETA?Motorola: ""As I said before, when there is information to be shared, it will be shared. In the meantime there is no news.""That last post was on August 10th, 2011. That means as of today it's been 10 days and still no answer on a firmware software update for triumph owners with the .38 version.I'm not even sure .39 will fix all the issues I'm having with the touch screen, but the fact remains customer service from Motorola sort of lacks here.4. BatteryThe battery leaves a lot to be desired. It actually gets worse life then my Optimus V from initial tests before I installed any battery saver apps. I'm sure once I installed an app it would help out greatly, but stock phone/battery life is dismal at best. Be prepared to have a charger on you at all times if you plan on USING the phone for any purpose like reading a book on the kindle app, getting on the web or even just tinkering around in the screens. You'll see the battery life fall pretty fast.So what's right with the phone?1. CameraThe main camera is pretty good. I took several pictures at the lake and they all were in focus and had no issues. It's not the higest MP camera I've used but for what it is it works well. The front facing camera in good light looks great, in low light it looks terrible.2. ScreenThe main display is bight and crystal clear, it looks great which is a plus when the phone lags and you are stuck at least you have something nice to look at.3. Slim designIt's a bit bigger then an iphone 3G, and a little larger then my blackberry Bold in terms of height and length. It's thinner then both in terms of width.4. SpeakerI was surprised at how loud and clear the phone was. I played a netflix video and it was very loud.",1.0,1313366400,"08 15, 2011",Motorola Triumph Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile),148.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41afT9O27oL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 27145},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"

B005DTSBEU,A33YZNZIRA3H97,l2,"[4, 4]","The only reason to consider buying a Motorola Triumph compared to an iphone or Android Nexus phone is the cheap monthly rate plans. I use the Virgin Mobile $35/month plan and it has enough minutes for me.No, the Triumph is not as good as an iphone or a Nexus, but you can't expect that for half the up front price, half the monthly price, and no contracts. What you do get is an above average smartphone with a good operating system (and very little crapware). The 4.1"" screen is easier on my eyes than the little 3.5"" screens that were common a year ago. The CPU and memory have double the specs of my old phone and it really shows when running Android apps. The camera is adequate for my use, though not nearly as good as a decent point & shoot.The negatives to this phone are slow GPS lock (for you people that like to check in everywhere), mediocre battery life (barely lasts through the day with average use), and below average signal quality. Cell service is noticeably worse than Verizon; probably comparable to AT&T; or T-Mobile. Virgin Mobile is owned by Sprint and uses Sprint's network, but apparently not all of it, so coverage is worse than Sprint.If this phone cost as much as an iphone or Android Nexus phone, I would give it only 2 or 3 stars because of the negatives. I'm upping that to 4 stars because of the cheap price; especially the monthly rate. The cell service is probably not adequate for serious professional use, but I don't mind being a little hard to reach if it saves me a lot of money.For your best price, buy this phone directly from Virgin Mobile instead of 3rd party sellers. Discounts and promotions are common direct from VM.

B005DTSBEU,A3NAI3O35MHNXS,lowkey2357,"[0, 1]","I was an early adopter of this phone model with Virgin Mobile.The screen was bright and large for a prepaid carrier's phone and it had just about all features that Android 2.2 could offer.The one I had was a total piece of garbage in my opinion.It worked great for about 3 or 4 months just long enough to exceed return time.Then it began to have problems the biggest of which was the darn thing would not charge.So I sent it back to Motorola for warranty repairs and that is when the fun began.You know the phrase not worth the paper it is written on.That is how I feel about most warranties.I am not sure if Motorola treats all its customers the way I was treated but buddy I was shocked how bad it was.So they received the phone and held onto it for about 2 months.I called and asked why it had not been returned and they said they were waiting on parts.So rather than make a happy customer and just send a replacement phone.I guess they decided they wanted a p*ssed off former customer instead.All they had to do was send me a working phone that I had paid for and provide a little customer service and I would have walked away happy.I felt like the reps at the Motorola support lacked any customer service training or experience at all.When the phone was finally returned it was replaced by a refurb phone.This phone did not have the charging issue but had other issues of its own.I will personally never knowingly buy another Motorola product as long as I live.So again if you think this is a bargain, I would say think again.Knowing what I know now I would never recommend this phone model or Motorola to anyone.Motorola's support for this product is lacking in my opinion and I cannot help think it reflects badly on Motorola as a whole.This phone looks great but it is totally lacking in substance and follow through.I have heard some say this was actually made in China.I don't know if this is true or not but it would certainly explain a lot.I put 1 star but it should probably be a half star cause it worked for 4 months before becoming useless.",1.0,1357776000,"01 10, 2013",Motorola Triumph Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile),148.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41afT9O27oL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 27145},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"

B005DTSBEU,A1DIFL0333QPEB,Marcus T. Brody,"[5, 7]","After losing my job, I needed to cut costs.  I have become very reliant on having a smartphone, after having 3 different BlackBerry's and an iPhone.  But I needed to chop that $125 a month down significantly.  I researched options, and saw that Virgin Mobile offered a pretty modern Android phone for $55 per month, unlimited everything.  I did my research, read reviews, and decided that I'd take the plunge.  I cancelled my AT&T; contract, sold my iPhone on eBay, and I was set up with Virgin Mobile and the Motorola Triumph.After 3 months, I can say, that this is a very serviceable phone.  It does everything I need it to, and it's very reliable, for the most part.  The phone DOES have a lot of different bugs and quirks, but I can deal with them, if it saves me $70 per month.  This is certainly no iPhone, but it does the job.  I can surf the web pretty darn quickly, the apps in the Android Markerplace are ok (not nearly as good as Apple though), and my texts and calls are pretty reliable.  The sprint network, which is what I'm connected to, isn't bad.  It's not as good as AT&T; was, but isn't as bad as T-Mobile.  It's somewhere inbetween, and like I said, it's serviceable.The phone has a lot of bugs and quirks, like I said.  The GPS is horrible.  I downloaded ""GPS Fix"" apps to try to remedy the problem, and it still stinks.  The GPS cuts out often, and sometimes can take as much as 2-5 minutes to connect.  I used my BlackBerry and iPhones as a driving GPS, but can't really do it that well with this phone, which kind of stinks.  This phone also freezes a lot.  Not for long, but it's still kind of annoying.  It also just randomly shuts off and restarts a few times a week as well.  All of sudden out of nowhere the phones says ""VIRGIN MOBILE!"" and shuts off, then says it again when it starts back up.It's pretty embarrassing having a Virgin Mobile phone, so I got a phone case, which covers the Virgin Mobile logo.  I say it's embarrassing, because I'm a person who has made a six-figure income, drive a $60,000 car, yet I can't even afford my freaking iPhone anymore because of this awful economy!  Thankfully my $60,000 car is paid off.  I've toyed with selling it, but it's de-valued so much, that I might as well keep one nice thing!The camera on this phone is pretty good.  5.0 megapixel.  The video claims to be 720p, but I beg to differ.  I have taken quite a number of videos on different settings, and the video camera is horrific.  It's no better than the video I used to take on my BlackBerry Curve, when that was a popular phone back about 4-5 years ago.  I do have a Video Camera that shoots in 1080, so I'm not too concerned with the video camera, although it would be nice if it were better.The battery life on this phone is EASILY the worst I've ever seen for any smartphone I've ever been aware of.  Be prepared to buy chargers for your car, work, and use the one that comes with the phone for home.  You'll easily need 3 chargers to maintain proper battery levels, because this phone SUCKS up the juice like nothing I've ever seen.  I've downloaded all kinds of ""battery fix"" apps, but all they do is shut turn off internet and GPS when you're not using it, so it has to constantly re-connect when you need it.  Sure, you can get better battery life, but it makes the phone perform worse.All in all, this is a very good phone for someone on a budget. $55 per month plus tax, I think it's like $59 or something per month, all inclusive.  I use the word ""serviceable"" for this phone, because it does a serviceable job at replacing the high end phones like a BlackBerry or iPhone.  It will never be an upgrade for those phones, but it pretty much does what they do. Not as well, but not that far behind.

At first I thought VM was just a bad provider because my Samsung Intercept had so many dropped calls, late or missing text and other problems not related to the service.When the Optimus V came out, I traded the Samsung in for it. I had had the Intercept for less than 30 days, less than 30 days that felt like a life time. Unless you like pain and headaches don't buy that phone.When I got the Optimus V nearly all those troubles were gone. Few if any dropped calls, Text went through quickly, GPS worked great (but to be fare, the GPS on the Intercept worked well too) and all the dire problems that were warned about because of the phones lower hardware specs never came to pass. Of the three VM phones I have had, the Optimus V was the best, Not the fastes but the most stable, where the phone worked as it was supposed to.Then came the Motorola Triumph. What can I say about this phone that is nice...........The screen looks good.........when it works.Easier to say whats not nice about it.Have tried to hook up to a half dozen phones by blue tooth. It will see the other phones but no talk to them. Screen flickers all the time, There is a dead spot that runs up and down the middle of the screen, some times it works and sometimes it is dead, back button only works about 60% of the time, Internet gets me a white screen more often than not and is pretty much useless, GPS only works if you use GPSfix first. Run GPSfix app before you need to use the GPS on the phone or you will never get a GPS lock. I have had to add a third party launcher to the phone which has helped a little with the phones stability. On my phone at least the launcher is not handling things well. I had to add Android Assistant to manage the apps and hardware usage to free up resources to reduce glitches in the phone.I am still trying to find apps that might help this phone, and it looks like people are getting the word that this phone is not worth the 300.00 that Virgin Mobile and Motorola think it is worth as no one wants to buy my phone. or even trade for 3/4 value.About Virgin Mobile. Their service is good if you live in an area where Sprint is well received. If Sprint service is spotty where you live, no phone is going to make it better.If your in a good Sprint area buy the Optimus V, it cost half that of the Triumph and works. It does not have flash but for me I would rather do without flash and have a stable phone than have a phone that does flash but I cant get on line with because the browser is goofed some how.If the Optimus V is not to your liking, wait for something better to come along. The Optimus Black/Marquee is thought to be out around Christmas and there is word that a couple other phones may be out before the end of the year. I strongly suggest that what ever you decide to get, do not get it the moment it is released.

The first one bought has been working great with no issues or problems at all and very happy with it. The second one died after just over a month of use. While in the middle of texting, the screen had a vertical line go down it and poof...dead. Called up Motorola tech support and they had us do a hard reset with no luck, and then had us change out the battery with the other Triumph, and still no luck. Going thru Motorola, we were going to have to send the phone back to them, have it fixed, then it would be sent back...and we would have to pay for the shipping to Motorola. We use the phones for Virgin Mobile, so we called Virgin and told them what happened and what we did with tech support with Motorola. They quickly set us up with a new phone being shipped out free thru FedEx, and with a return label to send the defective phone back for free. Pretty impressed about that with Virgin. Sux that the phone died so fast tho. Also, it seems the battery doesn't last quite as long as expected, but was still pretty good.I'll update later after we get the replacement phone and have it working for awhile",3.0,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",Motorola Triumph Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile),148.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41afT9O27oL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 27145},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"
B005DTSBEU,ANEXFROORI6F6,Pilchard,"[0, 0]","We bought 5 of these years ago, on the $25 Virgin Mobile plan. I moved one line to Straight Talk, but the other 4 are still on the $25 Virgin Mobile plan. After a few years, my daughter wore her phone out. As we can only switch to a phone that was active on the $25 Virgin Mobile plan at the time we bought this phone, we bought another.The newer phone seems to have improved GPS, and the back area over the battery is slightly re-designed to be more secure. Other than that, this is a basic Android phone. Likely underpowered for many kids today. However, if you want to talk, have some smart apps, and use internet this is a great phone. As it's 3G you won't be able to talk and access internet at the same time.Coverage in my area has improved over the years, it's on par with T-Mobile, but not as good as AT&T; or Verizon.We had car trouble several winters ago, and I slammed my hood down after a jump, but the hood didn't close. After a second slam, I checked for obstruction. To my horror, my personal Triumph was preventing the hood from closing. It took two decent hits, did not crack, or fail in any way. There was minor abrasion to part of the side of the phone. However, the glass was not adversely affected. By contrast a Google Nexus fell 3' and it's screen cracked into many pieces.

B005DTSBEU,A1J75JJ0Q2OEJN,Raven A. Wind,"[3, 3]","Okay, yes... What some of the other reviewers have said is true: The stock ROM on this phone has problems with GPS and a few other things. When reviewed using stock ROM, I'd have to say this is a 3.5-star phone because of those issues, and Motorola's decision to ignore those problems.Thankfully, the Android community doesn't let stuff like that go without fixing it, and so there are a few different custom ROMs to run on the Motorola Triumph. CM7 runs great, fixes the GPS issues, and grants all sorts of OS improvements that should have been there from the start. It does have some negatives, like taking time before they get around to implementing the HDMI port, and having minor issues with having both WiFi and Bluetooth running at the same time (major battery drain if you do this), but the gain in having a fully-working phone that can hit the GPS satellites, maintain call quality, make WiFi calls, do wireless tethering, and other improvements and upgrades is worth it, if you ask me.With CM7 installed, the phone is stable and performs like it should have out of the box. It's a little tricky getting it installed, but once you do it you'll be happy you picked up a Motorola Triumph. Add to that the fact that you can still use Virgin Mobile's super-cheap thirty-five dollar monthly plan to get 300 talk minutes plus unlimited data and texts, and you've got a winner here.Even if you do stick with stock Android, you'll be happy. But with CM7 this is a powerhouse for the price.",5.0,1342051200,"07 12, 2012",Motorola Triumph Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile),148.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41afT9O27oL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 27145},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"

B005DTSBEU,A11I1I9QLMAM1A,S. Power,"[430, 441]","If this phone came out a year ago, it would be among the top performing phones from any carrier on the market.  Its very fast Snapdragon processor, vivid 4.1"" touch screen, and rock-solid Android 2.2 performance were cutting edge 12 months ago.  I don't say that in a disparaging way, but rather want to show where this phone fits into the spectrum of available devices.  If you want the newest, best, phone, you'll still have to go to the contract carriers.That said, this phone does everything I need very well, and at $300 upfront and $25 a month for service, can't be beat.  It works even better than the Samsung Intercept that I replaced with it, and is reasonably priced.  $25 a month, compared to what plans cost on the contract carriers, and you'll make up the $300 upfront cost in about 6 months.  Brand new customers, may have to pay the $35 a month that they are changing their bottom plan to, but that is still a great deal ($35 a month for 300 minutes, unlimited web/text; $45 a month for 1200 minutes unlimited web/text; or $55 a month for unlimited everything).This is my second phone on Virgin Mobile, and it made me realize that a lot of the problems that I was attributing to the network were actually the fault of my Samsung Intercept.  This phone is more stable in every way.  Wifi, GPS, 3G, Voice, the touch screen, applications, everything about this phone works better and is more stable than they did on the Samsung.Beyond this comparison to my previous Virgin Mobile phone, here are a few comments about the phone:+ very thin and lightweight. I miss the physical keyboard of my Intercept, but only slightly.  The thinness makes up for it.+ durable design.  There aren't many cases available yet for this phone, but even without a case it seems durable.  I already dropped it once, on concrete, and other than having to replace the back cover, there were no issues.  The battery didn't even come out.+ vibrant screen.  The screen looks great on this phone.  I almost say that it looks as good as the display on my wife's iPod Touch.  The only concern with the screen is that it is 4.1 inches instead of 4.3, which has kind of become the new standard for Android phones, but I don't really think that .2 of an inch makes much difference.+ very good touch screen.  The touch screen on the Intercept had issues, compared to this phone.  We are finally able to play games on it, and type quickly on the touch screen.  Again, I think it is safe to compare it to the iPod Touch's performance.  Very good.+ fast processor.  Cutting edge Android phones are now starting to have dual-core chips.  The Snapdragon chip in this phone is single core, but that hasn't stopped it from doing everything that I've asked it to instantaneously.  Very snappy.+ Cameras.  The main camera on this phone is awesome.  Probably not as good as in an iPhone 4 or a real camera, but every bit as good as the stellar one in the iPod Touch.  The pictures and video it takes are amazing.  I don't think I'll ever be taking my real camera or my video recorder with me again.  Even the flash works well and doubles nicely as a flashlight.+ battery life.  The battery life on this phone is very good.  With any Android phone you can expect to have to recharge it daily, but this one at least uses its battery consistently and gradually.  That might not seem like a lot to ask for, but even with Android 2.2 many phones have battery management issues.  This one does not.+ GPS.  The GPS gets its signal pretty quickly and does a good job.  Not perfect in that sometimes you have a wait a few seconds, but none of them are.+ Vanilla Android.  I really like the fact that Virgin Mobile doesn't ""Skin"" their phones or put a bunch of bloatware on them.  This phone is pretty much stock Android 2.2 with a couple extra applications pre-installed.  Much better than the experience with other carriers that fill the phone up with their own software and interface.A few comments on Virgin Mobile:+ Network.  Network performance always depends on your location.  In some cities Verizon is great and AT&T; is terrible.  In others they both work great.  Virgin Mobile's phones operate on their parent company, Sprint's network.  Sprint and T-Mobile's networks as a whole, are not as good as Verizon's, but that does not mean they are terrible.  In my experience, this phone works very well in metropolitan areas, and pretty well in rural areas.  If your cell phone is your life-line and you spend time in rural areas, you may want to check the coverage for your area on Sprint's website.  Otherwise, I really having had any problems with the network.+ International.  Sprint and therefore Virgin Mobile only have network coverage in the US.  That means you can't roam internationally, which is both good and bad.  International roaming on any phone is very expensive.  When I travel outside the US with this phone, and want to make calls, I connect to Wifi in my hotel or at a shop, and use Skype.  It works perfectly and is much cheaper than international roaming, and is often free.I very strongly recommend that you ditch your contract phone and consider this phone or other Contract Free carriers.  AT&T; especially, and Verizon to some extent, are trampling all over their customers, and people are letting them.  The way to fix this situation is not archaic government regulation or laws, but rather consumers showing that they won't stand for it.  Get a contract free phone because it is the best thing for your wallet and works very well, but also know that if enough people do it the big carriers will have to improve the way they do business./// Update after 3 months of use.  ///I don't have much new to report on this phone, but wanted to provide an update after 3 months of use.  They are still working great.  Both my wife and I have had one from the beginning.  Neither of us have it in a case, and it is holding up very well both to purse life and hip life.  No scratches or anything despite normal drops and use.  A few points:+ Service continues to be great on this phone.  Virgin works much better on this than it did on the Intercept.+ I have had about 5 unexpected restarts in the three months of having the phone.  That isn't bad for an Android phone that gets a lot of use.  I think that some of those might have been caused by putting the phone 'power button side down' in the case, and inadvertently keeping it pressed.  Either way, I don't think that 5 is bad, especially if 3 of them were caused by the case.  My wife has never had an unexpected restart on her Triumph, though she doesn't use hers as much as I do.+ Screen.  The screen on this phone is great.  You do have to push a little harder on this phone than on some others, but you get used to it very quickly, and in the long-run, it is better.+ The camera is great (for a phone).I continue to be very happy with this phone, especially after its first three months of real life use.//// Updates after well over a year.  ////I haven been using this phone since the day it came out, over a year ago.  Although I'm disappointed that they haven't updated the OS to Gingerbread, I am overall still very happy with it.  I am especially happy with Virgin Mobile who seems to be improving every day.  They have always been acceptable, considering how cheap their plans are, but every aspect of their service just keeps getting better and better.  The 3G network is definitely getting faster, although possibly because they implemented a 2.5GB per billing cycle 'soft cap'.  Compared to what the contract carriers do when you use a lot of data, I think their soft cap approach is fair and benefits everyone on the network.  Their voice quality, network coverage, and availability also have improved dramatically over the past few years.  Also, their technical and customer service have gone from mediocre to excellent.I recommend Virgin Mobile more then ever.  I also recommend this phone, until they come out with better 'premium' phone offering to replace it with.By the way, Amazon's current price of $209 for this phone is a steal.//// Update as of summer 2012 ////I still think this is a great phone, especially for those who are grandfathered in to the $25 a month plan, but I have now upgraded to the HTC EVO V 3D 4G.  Anyone who is interested in 4G data speeds and carrier endorsed tethering capabilities might want to look into that phone.",5.0,1311811200,"07 28, 2011",Motorola Triumph Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile),148.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41afT9O27oL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 27145},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"
B005DTSBEU,A28AFDBZ8MD5B6,Tom,"[25, 25]","I have owned a lot of Android phones.  The Triumph has a good screen, good build quality, good touch screen response, good processor, good reception, good voice quality, and good battery life.  The camera is decent (5 MPixel) but lacks a dedicated camera button.  The battery door is easy to open without being loose; however, you do need to remove the battery in order to change the MicroSD card.  The phone uses soft buttons that light up in the dark (I prefer physical buttons, but fewer and fewer phones have them).  It is refreshing and nice to see that the Triumph runs almost unmodified Android 2.2.2 (note that this is not the latest version, but it is compatible with most apps).For comparison, the Galaxy S II (which I also have, for use in Europe) is slightly better in all of those areas, but at more than twice the price; I find that none of the Galaxy S II's improvements over the Triumph in these areas are practically important.  The Triumph is an inexpensive and powerful workhorse, the Galaxy S II is a nice luxury.Some other reviews have noted poor battery life, crashes, poor responsiveness; I have not observed any of those on my Triumph.  With Android, it is easy to provoke such problems by installing badly behaved applications; if you are having such problems, check which applications are using the CPU and battery (there are built-in tools under Settings for that) and uninstall them.  The one software problem I have had is that Twitdroyd crashes on startup, but it does that on the LG Optimus as well. Reception is perhaps slightly worse than the LG Optimus (based on the number of bars), but I have had no problems with it.Some words about the plan (as of August 2011): at the increased price of $35/month, Virgin Mobile's service is still a good deal.  There didn't used to be alternatives, but now AT&T; also offers a prepaid plan with $25 for 500M/30 days plus voice; Verizon's prepaid plan on an Android phone will currently set you back $75/month at a minimum, and you end up using the truly awful Motorola Citrus.  Coverage on VirginMobile is more limited than Verizon or AT&T;, but it is still excellent in many parts of the US, including most urban areas I have been to.  Unlike the Optimus, where the WiFi tethering setting was accessible using a standard third party widget, however, you can't fool the Triumph into WiFi tethering anymore.In terms of apps, I like to use SlideIt as a keyboard (it's similar to Swype), and there is a Virgin Mobile minutes checker in the market that keeps track of plan minutes.Given its excellent price/performance ratio, I think the phone clearly deserves five stars.Added 2011-09-05: I noticed in forums that people had some problems.  First, there were complaints about slow GPS location acquistiion; the Triumph is slower than the Galaxy S II, but I haven't found it to be a practical problem.  Also, people were complaining about instability; I can't confirm that, my Triumph has been rock solid, despite tons of applications installed on it.",5.0,1314057600,"08 23, 2011",Motorola Triumph Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile),148.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41afT9O27oL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 27145},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"

B005E06WE4,A1MJZAV7WH0LC7,Life Adventurist,"[1, 1]","Comparing it to the plastic hard case from Verizon - info that would have helped me when I was looking at cases. :)I got the Droid 3 when it first came out and cases were limited, so I got the pricey Verizon plastic fitted case. It worked fine, but once removed one of the little 'tabs' broke on the top piece. I found this Holster case and decided to try it out - it's awesome! It's like the pricey plastic fitted hard case but better! It fits the same way, but it's easier to 'grip' and I'm less likely to drop it when carrying other things. The case is much 'sturdier' compared to the plastic case and the case fits snugly but goes on easily (much easier than the plastic case had). The keyboard slides out perfectly and feels 'tight' and more controlled than it did without it. It fits in the holster nicely and is easy to remove when I need it. The holster clips on me easily and is also easy to remove. The little case stand works great too!Overall, this is the best case I've had for any phone (and I've had many!). HIGHLY recommend it!Editing to add on July 2nd, 2012: I still LOVE THIS CASE. I've had to remove it a few times now, it's simple to remove and put back on and doesn't break!

I bought it for that reason alone, and it has been worth every penny just for that feature. The shell-holster feature is sturdy and provides good protection for your phone, while also allowing conveniently keeping your phone easily available on a belt or something similar. Solves the problem of trying to decide which pocket to carry it in, or the difficulty locating your phone by rummaging around in your purse. The only (minimal) downside is that the shell does add a bit to the size/weight of the phone, but I have found it not to be a significant drawback. If the phone is already at the limits of size/weight that you find acceptable, then it might be a factor to consider.

While its long term durability is still to be determined, out of the box is an excellent performer.High points:-Very nice user interface. If you've ever struggled with a small button/indicator light to turn other headsets on or off, those days are over. On/off functionality with this device is via the hinged end of the microphone. Swing it open: on. Flip it closed: off. When it's open, a 3-color LED (green/amber/red) gives feedback the state of batter charging.-Three wearing options: ""in-ear hook:, ""on-ear-hook"" and ""in-ear gel (hook-less)"".

Until you've trained yourself on the four or five voice commands needed to master the app, you'll still need to do some screen touches for command confirmations.Pairing was fast and easy with this headset and an HTC EVO, and sound quality was excellent for incoming and outgoing audio.

B005FPT380,A2V9DTXTQ5YIMK,"A. Hudson ""bisou bisou""","[20, 24]","I have owned so many Bluetooths over the years I could probably open a wireless accessory store. The problem I have with owning so many is that I lose them because they are so small. I bought several Motorola Bluetooth headsets a few years ago, a different model, for my family and sad to say, they were terrible. I have always had great luck with Plantronics and thought they were the best around. I then bought thePlantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece (Cerise) [Retail Packaging] . I figured with a case and the extra built in charger it would be harder to lose. Not the case. I kept the Bluetooth charged and rarely used it and it was always dead. I did not own it long and recently pulled it out to use it; it would not charge or work. It was less than a year old and not used more than 10 times. I then started using Jabra, I thought Plantronics took a dive in their quality and Jabra replaced the quality for me. I own a Jabra speaker for my car and it is the best one I own. Or so I though. Over a month ago my best friend bought me a Motorola  Motorola T325 Wireless Bluetooth Car Speaker Portable Vehicle Visor Mount with Auto Pairing For All Cell Phones and Smartphones- BLACK- Non-Retail Packaging.. It seemed basic but all I needed. The sound is perfect and a lot like this headset.When I received this Bluetooth my first thought was, ""Oh boy, it is so small I already know I am going to lose it!"" It is the smallest Bluetooth I have owned. Pairing it took literally seconds to pair with myHTC Trophy Windows Phone (Verizon Wireless). I have worn it for several weeks now and have not lost it. I think it is because it is my favorite Bluetooth. I used it at extensive length at a car repair shop that sits at a busy intersection one evening. I was speaking to my parents who are both hard of hearing and they both heard me great! I love that I can turn up the volume from the headset or just by turning on the volume on my phone. To turn on the phone you simply open the mic and it is on. I try to make sure I keep it charged but sometimes I forget it in my purse and it has been in there for days, (with the mouthpiece/mic closed). In the past all my others sets I would have to recharge, not this one. I had it in my purse for days and just took it out and it said, ""Phone one connected, battery level is high"". That is exactly what my T325 says when I get in my car. The battery level is amazing!As far as comfort, I wear glasses and have not found a Bluetooth I can wear with my glasses. This is the exception! It fits behind my glasses, with the ear hook,  without moving them all over, it stays put without making one side of my glasses go up. I can put it on and take it off with my glasses and there is no disturbance. First Bluetooth I can wear with glasses, that is a biggie for me!Having a smart phone I love the A2DP feature. The Bluetooth is small enough that people cannot see it with my long hair while shopping and I can stream music or listen to the local police scanner with an application on my phone. Sure if I take a call people think I am talking to myself but they leave me alone and just think I am crazy, fine with me. Gets you through the shopping line a bit faster.Last, I was scared of losing this since I love it so much. I boughtCase Logic JDS-2 USB Drive Shuttle 2-Capacity (Black)to store it in and have on the outside of my purse. It is not ideal but fits my needs perfectly. I don't have to dig around looking for it in my purse, it is right there. I included pictures in the photo gallery for you to see.Just when I thought I found my favorite Bluetooth brand, it has been replaced.

B005FPT380,A2921P0RH0TZF1,AI,"[2, 2]","I have had four different bluetooths over the past few years, with my first being Motorola, the next two Plantronics and finally back to Motorola with the HX550 as my fourth.  My first Motorola was nothing to brag about and I seemed to constantly get complaints and so I was a little skeptical about getting another now.  The two Plantronics were decent but I always had connection issues resulting in static during a call.  After reading all the reviews about this headset, I decided to give Motorola another shot, and I am very happy I did.After using this for a couple weeks, more than any other bluetooth I've had, I absolutely love this headset.  The sound quality really is great for the user, being loud and clear, and I have asked people on the other end of the phone several times and they didn't realize I was using a bluetooth and were shocked to hear I was.  Noise cancellation seems to work well; I typically only use it when I am driving or at home, but it cancels out the noise from the road just fine and allows for a clear uninterrupted call.  As I mentioned, my biggest complaint with my last two headsets was the connection with the phone resulting in static while in use, and so far I have not had the faintest hint of static or a choppy connection with the HX550. It really holds a solid connection with the phone.  To add to that, the distance of the connection really is great - I am able to leave my phone in the charge dock and walk around my place no problem (the distance I've been away from if so far has been at most 30 feet, but at that distance and between two walls, no problem with the connection).  The battery life is truly superior to other headsets I've had.  I have charged it only once since having it (about two weeks now; I primarily use it when driving though so do not have it in all day) - since it is so easy to flip on and off with the boom, conserving battery life is really easy.  Lastly, I have an iPhone 4, and although I can't use the MotoSpeak app with it and gain some cool features like the text-to-speech, the ""answer"" and ""ignore"" feature work like a breeze and without fail.  Also, when not on a call, hitting the main button on the HX550 brings up the Voice Control feature on my phone (I have read on the iPhone 4s it brings up Siri), which allows you to dial hands free anyone in your phonebook - really making this little device capable of a relatively hands free experience on an iPhone as well.Overall I couldn't be happier with this bluetooth, and with the price around $40 it really can't be beat.",5.0,1329868800,"02 22, 2012",Motorola HX550 Universal Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,33.89,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/311OOgLxDWL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 269},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"

The flexible ear hook is also a marked improvement over its older siblings hard plastic version.My company phone is a pretty basic flip model so I really can't comment on the ability to dictate to my phone.

B005FPT380,A3S9DOTT4Z8JF9,Amozarte,"[12, 13]","The Motorola HX550, though not perfect, is a fantastic entry-level headset.I'm constantly on the phone, have worn a lot of headsets, and generally keep more than one with me at any time.  I'm currently carrying the Moto HX550 along with thePlantronics Voyager PRO+and theJawbone ERA.  Although the Moto is about half the price of the others, it manages to keep pace very well.The first and most important factor of any headset is the call quality- and the Moto HX550 is no slouch.  It's not quite as great as the other two, but after extensive use I've yet to hear any complaints about the sound of my voice or background noise.  Wind is sometimes an issue, but typically only in extreme wind conditions like driving with the windows down or moonroof open.  On my end voices come through clear and, with the ample range of this set, I can always find the right volume for the environment.  The HX550 has the ability to stream music too and although it does an adequate job for a single-ear Bluetooth headset, don't expect any miracles.Perhaps my favourite feature of this set is the tiny flip piece that puts the headset in standby mode when closed.  Combine this with the Moto's stellar 9 hour talk time and I can always count on my Moto to have sufficient charge.  The flip piece also makes a tiny headset even smaller, so I can slip it in any pocket and barely know it's there.The downside of the flip is that it disconnects the headset from the phone.  When it's time to turn it back on, the set sometimes fails to reconnect.  This only happens about once every twenty or thirty times, but it can be a huge inconvenience when you're trying to answer a call- I've missed more than one call because of it.The other annoyance is that, upon reconnecting, the headset has an overly lengthy audible prompt to let you know the connection was successful.  The prompt begins with a short musical tone and then a voice announces which phones are connected (up to two with multi-point) as well as the remaining battery life.  The whole sequence takes what seems like an eternity, all the while drowning out your caller.

Anderson,"[345, 357]","I've been searching around for a great bluetooth headset for years (literally), and while I found a few good ones, the majority of them were lacking in some way or other.  This particular headset is really just...awesome.The form factor is small with the boom closed, and it's very light.  It ships with an on-ear hook, an in-ear hook, and two differently sized in-ear no hook options.  I'm using the smaller of the two in-ear no hook pieces, and it is easily the most comfortable headset I've ever worn.  The only problem is that I forget it's there, and I end up walking around all day with a headset in.My headset showed up fully charged (which was nice), and when I opened the boom, a voice guided me through pairing it with my iPhone (!).  I'm used to hunting through the manual to find the right combination of keypresses to get the the headset into pairing mode, but this headset anticipates that and immediately gets to work. Pairing the headset was the completely painless and worked perfectly.The battery has lasted quite some time.  Each time you flip open the boom, a voice lets you know the headset is connected, and tells you the level of the battery.  You charge the battery with a micro USB slot on the end of the headset. I don't know how long it would take to charge, mostly because I haven't had to charge it yet.The sound is crystal-clear, and most people I talk to with this don't even realize I'm on a bluetooth headset.  The ""answer"" and ""ignore"" voice commands are a cool feature, and work reliably.  The headset turns off when you close the boom - this is a great battery-saving feature, and I really like not having to press a button and hold it for 3 seconds until I get some obscure series of blue or red flashes to indicate the headset is off.  If the boom is closed, it's off.The only minor complaint I have is that the mute functionality is a little tough to use with double-volume rocker (you have to press both up and down switches to mute the call) - it would have been nicer to have a dedicated button for this.One feature I don't personally have a use for, but just shows consideration by the designers is that you can pair with more than one phone, and answer calls from both if they're on.  Just something worth noting.Also, the package is fully recyclable, which is a nice add.  If you're looking for a new bluetooth headset, I can't recommend this one enough. I'd give it 6 stars, if I could.2/22/12 UPDATE:So it turns out the headset isn't waterproof. I accidentally washed it, and it's DOA.

B005FPT380,A3T4OHEAHOJ700,B. Colonna,"[197, 207]","I have owned a few bluetooth headsets, including a Jabra, a couple of higher end Plantronics, a inexpensive Logitech and even a Jabra visor-type unit which clips to your car visor.I do not want to confuse anyone by talking about other products in a review on this headset, but I thought it important to make a few comparisons.  And since I've found the Plantronics product line to be so awesome, I'll keep going back to that product below as I compare the two.None of these products has ever given me any trouble, and I found them all easy to pair with phones and the sound quality has been good on all of them.  On the two Plantronics, both variations of the Voyager Pro, the sound quality was exceptional, but the price was also in the $100 or more range, so unless you are a heavy business user,  those might be overkill.One of the minor annoyances with most headsets is turning them on or using different functions, which often involves tapping a button once, double tapping, etc.  One of the few brands that minimized that issue is Plantronics, especially with their proximity feature in their new Voyager Pro HD, which senses when it is on - or off - your ear and turns on/off accordingly.  Now, nothing is as easy as that, but the HX550 comes darn close.The HX550 is not priced extremely low, however it is almost half of the cost of the Plantronics Voyager Pro.  Yet the HX550 is a full featured, high quality headset.  I have always been a fan of Motorola products and find them to be among the most reliable mobile phones and accessories around.  If past performance is any indication, the HX550 will prove to be quite durable.So, what's in the box?* HX550 bluetooth headset.* 1 On Ear Hook* 1 In Ear Hook* 2 In Ear Gels* AC Adapter* User Guide.What I love about the HX550 is Morotola's ""RapidConnect"" feature.  You flip the small microphone open and its on, flip it closed again and its off.  This eliminates the feeling for some tiny button and checking to see if a little light is on, off, blue, red, etc.  Although if you like to use the status lights, the unit has a full complement of colors to alert you to different statuses.Pairing is very simple - when you first flip open the mic, a voice will prompt you through pairing.The sound is great - I would compare it to my much more expensive Plantronics.  No background noise and no one can really hear that I am on a headset.You can pair with two devices, which can be handy if you have a personal phone and a company Blackberry, for example.Design wise, the HX550 is lightweight and unobtrusive.  It is a small profile unit, and offers a few different ways to wear it (on ear, in ear by hook, in ear by gel).  As far as layout, there are just a couple of buttons, the Call button and the Volume up/down buttons, and one status light which changes colors.Battery life is excellent, although I've never had a battery issue on a blue tooth headset.  Plus when you flip this on, the voice tells you the battery strength!The warranty on this headset is one year; Plantronics gives a tow year warranty on the Voyager Pro.This headset uses the MotoSpeak application, which is great but it is only for Android phones.  MotoSpeak is a full feature text to voice application.  MotoSpeak is completely free, whereas Plantronics offers Vocalyst, which is more robust but has a fee associated with it.Overall, this is my new favorite blue tooth headset!  It's ease of use and sound quality is comparable to the more expensive Plantronics, and its about 40-50% less expensive.",5.0,1318896000,"10 18, 2011",Motorola HX550 Universal Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,33.89,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/311OOgLxDWL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 269},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"

The problem is that it isn't very comfortable when wearing for over an hour or so. So I did some research and it seems as though this headset is supposed to be about the best in the under $50.00 or so category.About this headset, I cannot say with much certainty (since mine was an open box item) but I did make several phone calls comparing this set with the Plantronics M50 and I was told on every call that I made that the cheaper $29.00 Plantronics M50 set had better audio quality and was easier to hear (meaning louder). I'm not sure if this would have been the same case when comparing a new in the box Motorola HX550 headset or not, but in this case the cheaper headset did sound better, and was louder on both sides of the calls that I made.Over All: DO not buy from Int'l Distributers! If your looking for a New in the box item this is not the guy to purchase your headset from. As I said above it came in a plastic bag with a charger, and only with one of the three ear pieces the earphone is supposed to come with. So you self a favor and avoid this guy. He is not trust worthy and if my experience is any indication you will not get a new in the box headset. I did return this item and they sent an early refund to my bank to expedite things (it still took four day's to see the funds back in my account), and BTW I called Amazon the same day this set arrived within the hour to return see about returning it).

Since this was only six months of routine use, I'd rate the HX550 pretty low now.############################ORIGINAL REVIEW FIRST MONTH:It's featherlight and among other features, it should charge to several hours of use in 15 minutes.  (Hint: The charging light is a tiny pin sized dot on the volume button; the socket is standard micro usb.)  Incoming and outgoing audio is very good.  Also, the earpiece audio can go pretty high (great if you are holding a conversation in an airport or other loud environment.)  There are three earpiece choices.  Two have an over the ear hook, of which one is sort of a naked little speaker and the other puts a gel ring around the speaker to shield noise and focus sound into your ear.  The third earpiece is an ""all in the ear"" type which comes in 2 sizes and works pretty well because HX550 is feather light.  (The all in the ear type mount lacks any sound shielding ring though.)  This is the first time I've had an active noise cancelling headset (for a long time those on the market always had mixed reviews for one or another reason) and I'm very happy so far.  I read complaints it took too long to pair when you first flip it open but it seemed quick to me.I spend a lot of time on business calls and have been traveling with a flip phone, a spare cellphone battery (some fancy phones allowing no spare battery), and two Plantronic 975's, since earpieces have only a built in battery.

B005FPT380,A13MKSASQ6YWL7,B. Willis,"[29, 33]","I own quite a number of bluetooth headsets.  I have at least 2 other Motorola models, 2 that are made by Jabra and 2 Plantronic units.  I haven't used this headset for long, but so far it's my favorite.There are a number of things that stand out.  First and foremost, it's comfortable.  Motorola includes 4 different earpieces so that you can wear the headset using an in-ear hook, an on-ear hook, or simply wearing it inside of your ear without a hook.  If you choose to wear it inside of your ear, there is a larger earpiece and a smaller earpiece so that you have the best possible fit.  I am a decent-sized guy, but the smaller piece works for me and I believe that I could wear this headset for an extended period of time without discomfort.Pairing is extremely simple.  Just turn the unit on and everything is voice menu driven.  I really like the fact that Motorola provides an AC charger that you can plug into your wall socket.  There's been a recent trend amongst many bluetooth device manufacturers of providing a 12 volt car charger instead.  I typically don't charge these things in the car, so the AC home charger works a lot better for me.The parties on the other end who I've spoken to have told me that my voice is very clear on this headset.  Likewise, I can hear them quite well.I have an older phone by design, so I couldn't test out all of the Motospeak features.  However, saying ""answer"" or ""ignore"" did work for me.So is there anything not to like?  Not much actually, although I do have 2 related nitpicky little things.  If you close the little microphone boom, it snaps shut with spring-loaded force.  This can cause 2 things to happen.  First off, it might make your ear ring a bit due to the slightly loud sound of the thing snapping shut while in your ear canal.  Also, the force of the spring-loaded mic can actually knock the headset off of your ear if you aren't using one of the hooks.But overall, I like this headset a lot and suspect that it will be the one that I use daily.

The H730 is better in every way including:- wearing comfort,- slipping on and off the ear,- call quality for me wearing the H730,- call quality for the person I am talking to (yes, I have compared both units with multiple people on the other end; the H730 was preferred each time), and- button controls (the vol buttons are better on the HX550 but the large command button most used is superior on the H730).I have had plenty of bluetooth headsets and the H730 as of March 2013 is still the best I have tried and I have tried units that cost nearly $200.So, if you're considering the HX550 (which is not bad), you may want to consider the H730 as well.",3.0,1365811200,"04 13, 2013",Motorola HX550 Universal Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,33.89,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/311OOgLxDWL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 269},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"

Took a second.  Slightly more work with the Plantronics but nothing major.Fit: The Plantronics is an in-ear model.  This Motorola is more of an over the ear model with a piece to squish in the ear.  It's pretty easy to take on and off.  The only thing that I haven't got down 100% yet is that it tends to point away from my head when wearing it.  Other than looking oddly, people on the phone have no trouble hearing me.  The Plantronics stuffs into my ear so it has a more intimate feel.  This one, much less so.Turning on/off: This is a big consideration for me because I hate, hate, hate charging my headset.  It always seems like when I need it the most, the battery is dead.  To turn off the Plantronics, you have to hold the on/off button for about 3 to 4 seconds.  Kind of a pain.  The Motorola, simple.  Just flip open the mic attachment and it's on.  Flip it back and it's off.  Easy to conserve battery life.  Big plus.Battery life: I haven't used this extensively but I will say that the profile in the iPhone does show the battery life.  Huge plus.  And when powering on, the headset tells you what it's battery level is.  Big plus.

B005FPT380,A3OC93X866Z8TB,Celestialsky29,"[4, 5]","I have been looking for a bluetooth that fits comfortably in your ear without having to hook around your ear.  Among other great features, this one is EXACTLY what I wanted!I have small ear canals, and I can't wear traditional earbuds as they just fall out of my ear.  The devices that hook around my ear won't stay inside my ear so I can't hear the conversation or the music well.  This bluetooth comes with 3 different earpieces.  1 for larger ears that tucks up inside your ear, the same piece for smaller ears and then a piece that hooks around your ear.  The piece for smaller ears fits PERFECTLY.  When I shake my head side to side, it doesn't move.  The hooked piece has a rubber bud that rotates so you can use it on either ear.The sound is clear, and loud.  There is a volume adjustment on the bluetooth, and I can also use the volume on my Motorola Droid 2 in conjunction with the bluetooth.  I was able to sync this within about 1 minute to my Droid 2.  This is the first bluetooth I have actively used, and I didn't have to refer to the manual to figure out how to use it.  I am computer and tech savvy, but this unit was very easy to figure out.  The side button adjusts the volume, the large button on the outside answers or disconnects.  You can also use the flip mechanism to answer.  If you already have it flipped out, you can say ""answer"" or ""ignore"" when you have an incoming call.  I really enjoy that feature.  Also, if you have the flip open, and a call comes in, it speaks the phone number in your ear so you don't have to look at your cell phone to see who's calling.  The only thing I would improve on would be to have it speak the contact name instead of the phone number.With my Droid 2, I don't have to switch between bluetooth and headset manually, it does it automatically.  So, if I have the bluetooth closed, or charging, and the phone rings, it knows that the bluetooth isn't accessible and automatically gives me the option of using the phone.  This also works if I have the bluetooth on, and the phone rings, I can press the ""bluetooth"" button on my touch screen and it will turn it off so that I can answer with the phone instead.  In the middle of a call, if I decide that I want to use my phone instead, all I have to do is touch the bluetooth button and it switches to my phone.  I found this very convenient.I love it!  I can't say enough good things about it.  It has terrific sound for the caller and receiver, it fits perfectly in my ear, and its very easy to use.  I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.

The sound is very good, the volume is loud enough for all but the loudest situations, the pairing was fast/simple, the range is exceptional, the battery life is impressive and the charge time is unbelievable.  15 minutes on a charger for a full charge!If there is a down-side, the earpiece options are excellent, however the soft rubber ear inserts are a bit fragile.  I tore mine removing it from my pocket so be careful with those.  If anyone knows where to get replacements please comment on my review.  If I find them I'll post it later as an edit. It still works, but probably needs to be replaced before it tears any more.One other note on the ear inserts: if you use the either of the ear loops you need to use the donut-shaped ear insert that comes with it.  It is removable and you can move it to either loop.  If you don't use it, it will tend to fall off and the volume will be too low because it doesn't bring the sound into your ear canal without it.",5.0,1340582400,"06 25, 2012",Motorola HX550 Universal Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,33.89,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/311OOgLxDWL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 269},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"

I have a drawer full of discarded bluetooth headsets. In the last few years I've had a Plantronics, two Jawbones (ICON and ERA), and most recently - this unit. I'm sad to say, that while this unit is marginally better than the ERA, I still have to switch to the handset to clearly hear the caller, and for the caller to clearly hear me in noisy environments. The unit works fine in a quiet environment; but if there's any significant background noise (driving with the window open; walking down a busy street), it is difficult for me to hear the caller, and when I switch to the handset, the callers always claim that the sound is much better.I'm sure part of it is my 50+ hearing, and some of it may be the bluetooth on my Galaxy Nexus.

B005FPT380,A15ML85W54A2AH,Do42,"[3, 4]","The sound quality and battery life on this unit are excellent. It has A2DP so it plays music or other audio through the headset although naturally in mono. I can listen to audiobooks from my phone and the sound is clear and loud. The noise rejection is amazing. I can jog or drive in my convertible with the top down and the wind noise is minimal. With a wired headset the other party says it sounds like I'm in a hurricane. In a LOUD restaurant with plenty of background noise the person on the other end barely hears anything in the background. The background noise rejection is simply amazing.It has a voice recognition program for Android called Motospeak. The voice recognition gets a F grade as the voice recognition rarely gets the words right but there are other settings in the app that are useful such as reading out text messages.The one drawback is the advertised 300ft range is NOT 300ft. It goes no further than any standard bluetooth headset. I'm not sure why they advertise it as 300ft and not the true 30ft. It's hard to believe Motorola made a typo so I have to consider it deliberate deception.I've read other reviews where others have commented on the range and their experience is identical to mine. I've read no comments on anyone getting more than the standard bluetooth range.I would buy this headset again but some could buy it for the 300ft range in which case it's false advertising. If it stated the true 30ft range, I would give this unit five stars.The range is really no big deal, you won't be 300ft or even 20ft away from your headset usually but false advertising is false advertising and that one factor could be the factor that makes someone choose this headset.UPDATE: I've done some research on 300ft bluetooth headsets and I have updated my review and my rating to five stars. Motorola is not exactly lying, they just aren't telling you the whole truth.If you have a phone with a Class 1 radio then it will transmit to 300ft. The problem is that as of September 2012 there are NO phones with Class 1 radios in them. So as of now, NO phones will go the advertised 300ft.The bottom line is that given the choice I would prefer the 33ft(10m) over the 300ft(100m) range simply because the power output is 40 times less and I prefer to have as little radiated power as possible going into my head.The following table compares the available Bluetooth power classes. These are POWER classes, NOT Bluetooth device or version classes.Class Maximum Power Operating RangeClass 1 100mW (20dBm) 100 metersClass 2 2.5mW (4dBm) 10 metersClass 3 1mW (0dBm) 1 meterIf you wish to communicate over the 100m range, you will need a class 1 Bluetooth device at both ends.If you wish to communicate over the 10m range, you can have a class 1 or class 2 device at both ends.Many people make the mistake of believing that they can extend the range of their class 2 device to 100m by purchasing a class 1 device for the other end. This is simply not true. Consider two people standing 100m apart, if person A yells loud enough for their voice to travel over 100m, person B will be able to hear what person A is saying, but if when person B replies they only yell loud enough for their voice to travel over 10m, person A will obviously not hear the response.Thus is the case with the HX550. It technically will go 300ft with a Class 1 phone. There just are no Class 1 phones at the moment and even if there were, I don't want 40 times the power output going into my head just to go a few more feet. So given the new info AND since rarely will my phone and headset be more than 30ft apart, the existing 30ft range is just fine.",5.0,1346371200,"08 31, 2012",Motorola HX550 Universal Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,33.89,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/311OOgLxDWL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 269},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"

The pairing was simple and the control intuitive. The inclusion of 3 different earpiece set-ups was also very nice. I was able to try various configurations without having to buy the different parts. The sound from music and phone calls is great at all times on my end and the noise cancelling microphone has received much appreciation from folks on the other end of the line.However, they also notice (easily) when my battery is getting low. Apparently the quality of the connection from the headset to the phone is reduced tremendously as the battery loses power, needing to be within a few inches of each other towards the end of the battery. The unfortunate part is that only the other person can tell there is a poor connection. What sounds fine to me sounds like heavy wind to the other person when the battery is low (even if I'm sitting in a quiet room).

Well... when I first got this earpiece, I was using iPhone 4s running iOS 6.0. The HX550 paired and worked flawlessly. I upgraded to the iPhone 5 and all that went away. On phone calls lasting longer than about 2 minutes, the HX550 would make a click sound and disconnect. I resigned to writing off my beloved HX550 as a lost cause. As I thought about it, I wondered if the fact that since I had originally connected my HX550 to my iPhone 4s AFTER I had updated iOS and it worked fine, if doing the same on the iPhone would work. When I first got the iPhone 5, I immediately connected the HX550 BEFORE updating iOS (and it didn't work). So, I wiped my phone clean and restored to original factory settings. Then, I updated iOS.

The biggest issue is the My Motospeak app that it uses.I have a Droid Razr.  My Motospeak has never worked well.  It responds to text messages only intermittently, and most of the time I have to manually deal with the text in one way or another (including the fact that my phone does not register that the text has been read by the app and I have to actually read the text to turn off the reminder).  This negates the entire purpose of using this 'hands-free' app.  The speech recognition is really poor, and I can't rely upon it to send an accurate text most of the time.  It doesn't recognize 2 out of 3 names when it comes to voice dialing, and while it can read out the contact name when I receive a text msg., for some reason it can't do it for incoming calls and will only say the phone number.  Slowly.  So that by the time I can decide if I'm going to answer the call, it's already gone to voicemail.

The smaller in-the-ear mount worked better.However, I originally thought that the on/off control via the flip stem would be a good idea.  Unfortunately, in use it did not work very well for me at all.  Making the flip action unfold from the inside of the device (the part that is against your face/ear) was not a good choice.  There is minimal clearance when you are wearing the device.  So my big fingers with minimal nails could not easily find the end and open the stem w/o pulling the device out of my ear.WHY put the flip action from the inside out, rather than the more logical from the outside down?  Or make the stem rotate from the top of the device down to fully deployed.  Either would make more sense!During use, if I wanted to open this small flip stem to take/make a call w/o having the device come out of my ear, I had to use two hands - one to wiggle my fat finger between the device and my face to search for the stem end (up near the inside middle of the device) and the other hand to hold the device in my ear so it wasn't pulled out when I folded the stem out.  Using two hands to enable the device is obviously not practicable when driving.As for the sound, my friends said I sounded OK and background noise was eliminated nicely.

However, for me comfort was an issue [the thick earpiece on the Voyager caused pressure on my close-to-my-head ears.] So, I got a Motorola H15. Great comfort with the slim earpice and light weight - horrendous sound quality at both ends. I gave up on bluetooth headsets for one year. Then, I saw the reviews on the Motorola HX550 both on Amazon and websites that reviewed newly released products. This one is lightweight, comfortable and has superb sound quality at both ends. It truly has great noise cancelling: I've told my friends I was on a headset and they thought I was talking directly from the phone. It has a great range: I can leave my phone turned on in the car, go into a store for a few hundred feet, and still be connected. If the connection gets lost, a recorded voice says the headset is disconnected. With compatible phones, it responds to voice commands like ""answer, call ..., etc."" The battery life is unbelievable. Upon each fire up, a voice tells you if the battery power is high, medium, low. They only weakness I've noted: I wish the ear piece held the phone a bit more securely to the ear. That's the only reason I didn't give this a ""five."" I found the ear bud attachment, a provided option, even worse. I have had the headset occasionally fall off. However, even though the phone feels like it's just ""floating in air"" and not firmly attached, the voice quality is still top notch. So, perhaps it's just me.

B005FPT380,A1FJBWP2R3NSH4,LJS,"[3, 6]","This product is only a little short of amazing. I am giving it one star, because of a problem that needs to be fixed. (NOTE: Problems now fixed with OS upgrade and workaround. See 2nd update below.)Clarity - 5 stars: Everyone I have talked to has said that the clarity of the HX550 is excellent whether on the road or in the office.Ease of use - 5 stars: The My MotoSpeak application as well as the earpiece itself provide an excellent user experience and are very easy to use.Voice recognition - 5 stars: The voice recognition is nearly perfect in catching every word and translating voice to text.Voice calling - 5 stars: Whether saying, ""Call Nancy Mobile 1"" or ""Call 651-555-1212,"" calling using voice commands couldn't be easier or more reliable.Voice texting - (Now 5 stars. See update below.) 1 star: The application beautifully converts voiced messages to text, and equally amazingly reads text messages that come in while using the bluetooth earpiece. These features are lifesavers for someone who is on the road a lot. Unfortunately though, the My MotoSpeak application does not allow the messaging applications on Samsung Galaxy S3 and Samsung Galaxy Exhilarate phones to acknowledge the messages as sent. As a result, the messages eventually show up as failed in the messaging applications that come with these phones (even though in most cases the messages do indeed go through). So unfortunately, I am unable to use this wonderful feature.Motorola has outdone themselves with this outstanding reasonably priced bluetooth earpiece. I will happily change this review from one star to five stars as soon as Motorola fixes the voiced text message acknowledgement issue. Despite the issue, I am keeping the HX550 because the functions that do work are excellent and because I'm hopeful that Motorola will fix the issue with Samsung messaging applications. (I have called and informed Motorola support of the issue.)12/7/2012 Update: I have completely given up using this product for work. The MotoSpeak app fires off the Samsung music player at the conclusion of every call I make. I'm very disappointed that Motorola is not interested in correcting their software for use with Samsung devices. I guess they're only concerned with Motorola devices. 1 star.12/30/2012 Update: I just updated my Galaxy S3 to the Jelly Bean operating system and the voice texting now works perfectly. Instead of using MotoSpeak, the earpiece uses Samsung S Voice to send text messages. Voice recognition is still spot on perfect (amazing!). The only slight drawback is that it no longer reads voice text messages back to you before sending. But the voice recognition is so good that it's really not necessary. It did not make a single error during my testing.With regard to the problem of music playing after dialing phone numbers rather than using listings already in the phone, the Jelly Bean update did NOT correct that problem. However, I was able to do a work around by deleting all my music from the phone. Now that the music is gone, the HX550 now operates properly in all ways and I can use it for work. I am very happy about that because nearly all the functionality of this product is perfect. Sacrificing my music from the phone is not that big a deal because the purpose of the phone is for work.I'm leaving the 1 star review so that other Galaxy S3 owners know what they're getting into.

B005FPT380,A2G1GT7AL6I8US,Michael,"[2, 2]","I evaluate bluetooth headsets based on 5 key characteristics: Reception, Battery life, Sound, Ergonomics and Aesthetic. The Motorola HX550 makes very well in the first three and not too well in the last two. I used it several hours every weekday listening music for about 8 months until it started showing some problems that I will describe below.-Reception: 5 Stars. This is the best feature of this headset. It received the signal from the cell phone at about a dozen yards with no interruption in the middle of factory plant. There were no walls in between, but a lot of electromagnetic signals from machines, computers, other bluetooth headsets, etc.-Battery life: 4 Stars. As advertised, the battery lasted 8 hours (+- 10 or 20 minutes) of continuous use. It took about 50 minutes to charge it completely. There other headsets with 11 hours battery, but they sacrifice sound quality and reception.-Sound: 4 Stars. The volume level and tone balance is high and clear enough. This headset has a very good noise cancelation, which makes easier for your party to understand you when talking in high ambient noise. Other headsets have better tone balance.-Ergonomics: 2 Stars. It's too heavy, even for an ear accustomed to hold earphones. At first, you won't feel any discomfort, but after several hours of use you can feel some pain until you get used to it. The ear buds provided were too big for me. Anyways, they can't be smaller because they wouldn't hold the headset on the right position (toward your face). Also, the idea of a swivel power switch wasn't very smart. It makes it hard to turn on and off the headset while it's in your ear. You have to do it sometimes if you need to save battery or after a non-successful pairing (not frequent). You will hear a sharp click right on your ear when the swivel hits the body of the headset to turn it off.Aesthetic: 3 Stars. The design makes it look bulky. I don't think it would be the preferred choice for a lady paying attention to elegance. I think that they probably had to make room for a powerful battery, antenna and hardware, but the exterior design suffered a lot.Conclusion: As said before, the reason for getting rid of this headset was a speaker problem that showed up at about 8 months of intense use. Every time that I turned it on, the speaker started working intermittently. I had to restart it several times for the speaker to work well. However, the problem came back randomly while using the headset. I still would recommend this product with some warnings.

The earhook that comes attached to the headset when you purchase it works great keeping the bluetooth on your ear.  It's so comfortable that you forget you have it on.  The sound is great in most conditions, though I have gotten some complaints if I am walking on a very windy day that the sound is a little bad.  I can hear callers very clearly, and my music comes through very well also.  The MotoSpeak app which allows you to speak and hear text messages is great for hearing them but the app has some lag when trying to speak back to it.  Most phones have built in voice recognition now and that may work better than the app does.  But to me, that in no way diminishes the usefulness of the headset.  Also, the white color, to me, makes it easier to locate than the traditional black headsets.  I've lost many headsets in my day, but this one stands out much more so I haven't had a problem locating it (knock on wood, LOL).

But what sets it apart?-A2DP capability means that you can listen to music or media over your headset--a very nice feature missing from most of the older headsets.-MOTOSPEAK: a free app from the Android market (no iPhone app yet, I think) that will--wait for it--READ YOU YOUR TEXT MESSAGES ALOUD and then allow you to SPEAK YOUR RESPONSES!!  This is pretty amazing and something of a game changer!  While there may be similar programs out there that do this, I cannot stress how neat this felt.  You just hear it speak in your ear: ""New text message from Frank Pikowski... Don't forget to bring the cables, see you soon""  And then you can simply reply with your voice and it will transcribe and send it.  I feel like this will be something that we'll see on the iPhone 5 or 6 and is generally the way of the future... but this brings it to you now.It also has a few other neat features that make it a cut above:-A neat little arm that ""flips"" open when you want to turn it on and flips closed to turn it off: this is such an elegant and ergonomic way to do this-A HIGHLY customizable in-ear or over-ear setup for attaching it to you (I rather like the default over ear setup)Bottom line: A superlative bluetooth headset that does the basic tasks beautifully but has a few extras that make it worth a close look.

It came in a very generic box, but after checking with Motorola, they said there was no packaging like that - not even OEM. So at that point I just got fed up with my experience trying to get this headset and did not even test the USED one. I just returned it and went to a store to buy one.

May get another one looking to see what else is available.I have tried the Jawbone (original, Icon, Era), Plantronics (Discovery 925 & 975, Voyager Pro, Pro HD, Marque M155, M100), Sound ID (forget the model, Motorola (H17, H12) and many many more - Only the Jawbone Icon worked well but they (yes plural) would break within 6 mos by generating an irritating sound my callers would hear (sounded like loud rushing wind).  After having done Aliph Jawbone returns twice (not the easiest company to deal with) I gave up on the Jawbone line in search for something else.I spent many many hours over days trying to find the bluetooth headset that:* would NOT cut my voice off, make it sound like a robot or muffled* have good sounding clear loud speaker (I have some hearing loss)* A2DP - I can stream audio, listen to podcasts, nav directions, etc.* excellent noise cancellation (I drive a Honda Fit - not a quite car ride)I believe the Motorola HX550 is a winner. It just works and works well (iPhone 4S).  My only complaint is that Siri's voice is really loud and there is no way that I have found to reduce the volume of her announcements (had this problem with the Marque M155 as well).I was really skeptical of buying this unit because:* I never thought Motorola made good BT headsets* it was only ~$50 deliveredHowever, the Moto HX550 really delivers and the fit is very secure and comfortable.  I didn't think I would like the folding mic boom but it is really convenient for stowing and doubles as power switch for the unit.  It pairs fast and connects in less the 2 secs (from off) with my iPhone.

Initially when I saw this charger I thought it would be nice to use but wasn't worth the cost. Obviously you can just take your current battery out, put your new one in and charge it in your phone if needed.A few days later I actually ended up breaking part of my micro usb port on my phone. Careful trying to plug those things in the dark late at night forcing when things don't want to go. =)Warranty does not cover physical damage to the phone and instead of doing an insurance claim, paying the deductible and then getting a refurbished phone, this stand alone charger started to look very good. I still say it is overpriced for what it is, but it's exactly what I need. I use it charge my batteries since my usb port is not an option. You have to use the charger that came with your phone or a car charger for your power source. No big deal there. This thing uses the same micro usb port that your phone does.When I first got it, I was surprised to see a cradle on both sides of it. I was excited thinking I could charge two batteries at the same time. You can't. They are different sized as well. While they hold the batteries for my Electrify, the Phonton's twin, very well there is nothing to keep it from falling out if you pick it up and turn it over or on it's side. Normally this is not a problem but if you were using the car charger option for example it might be hard not to have this happen occasionally.  I just put a rubber band around it and the battery won't fall out regardless of the position the base is in. 4 stars is more then adequate considering no charger comes with it and there is no support to keep the battery in place. Those are very minor things. If the cost was cheaper I'd go 5 stars.

The Samsung 1A charger from my Galaxy S3, the Motorola 0.85A charger from my Motorola Droid 2, and a 0.85A charger from a LG phone were the only ones that worked properly.

The ""Power On"" light is not overly bright, just right so as to be obvious but not blinding.A nice, strong USB cable is included, which is long enough for car use (some devices only come with a few inches of length).Con:Not really a con, but the output is rated at 750mA, which means it will not charge any of the newer high power tablets like the Ipad or my Dell Streak 7 (both require 2000mA to charge).

Not a biggie as the camera sucks anyway. I have a DSLR for photos.The phone is great; very responsive. I found on my old one, I had a tendency to overload it with apps. Not only did it drain the battery, but too much RAM was used and it slowed the phone down.Found a new battery every year also helps. After a while, they just don't hold a charge anymore. They are not expensive here @ Amazon.All the accessories (charger, Otter case, etc) works from the original Droid.Lots of options with this phone. It has seven (7) home screens to customize. I used one for contacts THE home screen; and other for groups of apps. ...theme pages. One has maps and navigation, one voice command and personal assistants, one Weather, Facebook and text widgets and a calendar and post-it note page each.

The Droid X2 is a total downgrade. It is almost the exact same phone only made of cheaper materials. It is a tiny bit thinner but they are otherwise the exact same phone. All Droid X accessories fit the Droid X2.The X is more solid. The X2 just feels really generic. A piece of the battery cover on the X2 broke off inside the phone. Called Amazon Wireless and they couldn't replace it because the X and X2 are now discontinued. They kept trying to push me into taking it to Verizon. I said if I wanted to deal with Verizon, I would have upgraded through Verizon. Ended up switching to a Razr 16gb which I had to pay $80 for even though I got the X2 for free. Just a terrible experience through Amazon Wireless and if their customer support just keeps going on like this, they're not going to be in business for long. Terrible customer service.I wanted the X2 instead of the more expensive phones because it has a battery that you can take in and out and replace it any time it wears down. With the new phones, such as Droid4 and Razrs, the battery is internal and cannot be replaced without sending it in for servicing. With as much as I use my phone, I knew I needed a battery I could take in and out which is why I have never wanted an iPhone.So, don't buy this phone. Buy the cheaper but better more solid phone in the Droid X. I love it. It's my fave phone and I've had Droid2, Droid2 Global, and Droid X2 as far as smartphones go. The X has very stable software.

And no one to report this too and get help (no customer support)).-- After I got the dock, ""Motorola"" tries to force an additional computer (drivers) update (other than the standard USB ones), if you download it, each time you connect to the computer, three folders open.  One is the Motorola drivers folder and this seems to make a browser window open and it connect to the internet, to a Verizon wirelesses backup service, a video self starts, advertising a service I dont want or need. Apparently I have to Root the phone, to remove this nag-ware from the phone, in order to make it stop. Work around (sorta): And and remove programs, and remove the offending Motorola folder. The third folder still opens, after docking, but no internet sales video starts.-- The info area at the top of the phone is supper tiny and there seems to be no setting to make it bigger.-- The signal strength bars, has just 4 bars, instead of the standard 5, and is hard to see.  Having no signal, is common where I live, and the no signal looks, like full bars.-- The info area messages comes and goes, faster than I can read (same area).-- GPS wont actually turn on, when selected (using maps), if the cellular service is turned off.  The symbol shows up, but not worke.  The work around is: Turn on cellular, then GPS, then turn cell back off, to make GPS work.  Even still some times the GPS just wont work.  THen it takes a power off-on reset. Sometimes this dose not work and you need to do the remove the battery reset, and reinstall the battery, to restart the GPS...-- Screen timeout dose not apparently apply to wake up screen and sometimes the screen goes to sleep, as I'm trying to inter the password or shut the phone off, or set it into to airplane mode.-- There is a lot of data consuming bloat-ware on the phone and rooting is the only solution is to remove. This stuff also kills memory and slows the phone as sum of it, starts and runs despite that I'm not using it. There is way too much trash, supplied by Verizon, on this phone.-- Android/ Google. I'm not liking the disclaimers, that accompanies 98% of all the applications. One example: Why dose a mapping program, need to take pictures or record sound, or can even make phone calls, without user intervention???  This is in may of the disclaimers, when you download software to the phone from the Google Play Store - Why???-- Weird battery removal process, and poorly described. A piece of plastic (red) label is used to pry up the battery. It exceptionally unprofessional - a cheap solution. I expect it will fail (tare), making imposable to remove the battery, over time. I use my phone enough, I use several batteries, and even one a separate aftermarket charger, to charge batteries out of the phone. I own 4 batteries, one of the original 1500mAh battery, the other 3 are aftermarket BH5X that is 1900mAh, I got from ebay. All are the standard thin, non-fat (dose not take a different battery door), battery.Inclusion:As you can see, I have many somewhat minor issues with the phone.

It has held up from the drops and oops and still keeps going strong. The biggest disadvantage today for this phone is that you are limited to what version of Android your carrier decides to stop at before no longer upgrading. It is well capable of handling the later versions of the android operating system but unfortunately for us, our carrier has discontinued android OS updates for the X2 at 2.3. But if you are willing to live with that then this phone is a good reliable choice. Battery life is good but like most batteries these days, they start to dwindle in lifespan after a couple years and you are stuck at either upgrading or spending a premium for Motorola's replacement battery.This phone is good for a replacement phone that you don't want to pay an outrageous price for or you don't want to renew a contract.  Having owned this and the original droid and both lasted a long time, the major difference between the two is that the X2 is a bit faster overall that the original droid, but with either one you can't go wrong with a reliable phone.",4.0,1390608000,"01 25, 2014",Motorola Droid X2 No Contract Verizon Cell Phone,90.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518%2BtF83heL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 10226},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"

I did a LOT of research before deciding on this phone. My provider is pagepluswireless which is a prepaid cell phone company and they only have a 3G capable network so I needed a phone that was 3G and not 4G. I found this to be the best price/spec/screen size phone for what I wanted. Only real drawback is the stock battery is really bad, goes dead in about 30 minutes of the screen being lit. I bought an extended battery and new battery cover for it for about $17 on Amazon here and that has worked great. Battery life is now excellent.

It will make your phone a bit fatter, but I don't mind the extra girth at all, and it makes the phone more comfortable to hold for me. Phone is still pretty light even with extended battery.I was pleased to see that the battery and case certainly look OEM. The sticker has serial numbers and marking that look exactly like my normal OEM battery. Also, the plastic extended battery back panel, looks and feels exactly like the original along with the Verizon, 4G and Google logos. As far as I can tell, this is the real deal OEM.Performance: I received the battery with about 80% charge. I charged the battery to 100%, then I downloaded and installed the ""BatteryCalibration"" app from the android marketplace. I followed the 4 simple steps.1) Plug your phone to the charger2) Wait till it charges to 100%3) Click ""Battery Calibration""4) Unplug your phone.What this app does is wipe your battery stats. It forces the phone to recognize that you have a new and different battery with different capacity. If you don't do this, you will not get optimal battery life out of your new extended battery.After doing Calibration, I allowed the phone to die completely and then charged it again. Under first charge, my phone last just over 24hours. It's a brand new phone for me, so I have been playing with it extensively all day, using 4G mainly, some WiFi, games, pictures, a bit of Navigation, and lots of texting, emailing, browsing, etc.So 24 hours I think was really good. My other battery would die after 9 hours tops of similar use. I'm sure if you use the phone moderately throughout the day, you might even get a day and a half of battery life out of it.

I commute by bus/trolley, so I need my phone handy at nearly all times to check transit schedules and maps. So, I thought this case would be great to clip onto my backpack strap, like with my original case/holster. Nope! The clip either digs into my side or scrapes against the inside of my arm, because it extends WAY past the case when the phone is in a vertical position. It's also nearly impossible to simply slip the phone out of the holster because there is a lip around all sides of the phone. I've actually missed phone calls because I spent too much time struggling with the stupid holster! And lastly, I dropped my phone while in a two-handed struggle to get it out of the holster. The top and bottom edges of the phone aren't protected by the case, so of course the phone landed in such a way that the lower front edge got shredded. The damage is only cosmetic, but still considerable. I had an Otterbox Defender originally, but they don't make a case for the extended battery.

It is one tough holster - and has many grooves on it for gripping it.  There are some nice features, and some not so nice.NICE:  The part that grips the phone works with both the extended battery and the slim battery.  SMART!It also has a push out stand that holds the phone either sideways like a picture frame or vertically like a portrait position for charging, nightstand in a motel, etc (I'd still buy the a/v nightstand setup simply for the hdmi output)Not so nice - the beltclip is not nearly as strong as the case grips the phone and I've already dropped it into my car between the open door (the threshold body part plastic) and the seat - found it there when I could not find my droid, but the missing phone app told me it was at my house somewhere.I'd give it 5 stars if the belt clip were stronger or better designed (wider).  NOTE - the clip can be rotated for landscape or portrait carry, but you must draw the phone out of the clip in a portrait orientation.All togther, this protects the screen, the back, allows photos to be taken, and makes the phone more useful when not in the dock.  It's rugged material and does not look like it would break except POSSIBLY in extreme cold (I have an environmental chamber that will go to -100 deg C and I would NOT put this thermoplastic into the chamber at that temp - I suspect permanent damage might happen and I like my case!!It's almost a 5 star product.

The tiny green light on one side is very bright when fully charged. It has yellow light for 80-20% charge, and red for less than 20% charged. Pairing to my iPhone was a simple one-step process confirmed by a verbal acknowledgement from the device.  It comes with four ear piece choices for on-the-ear with an ear hook, in-the-ear with an ear hook, and two sizes of in-the-ear without an ear hook.  When pairing the voice says ""Connected to Phone 1 (or 2 or tablet).  With Android or other phones with ""NFC technology"" pairing is simply taping the headset against the phone.  Motorola claims a 300-ft range from the phone.  I've gone quite a distance but not a full 300 feet.  My biggest concern is will it work inside a ""big box store?""  All the steel and concrete prevents adequate signal transmission.  I have not had an opportunity to try it in a big store, like a Costco, Lowes, etc. and will update once that trial is done.  On and off is just a flip of the little speaker. The ""flipper"" is a little cumbersome to open when it's being worn closed/off, and would likely be difficult for people with large fingers.  It can be worn in the open and off position, then just push the call button when receiving or placing a call. The call button on the end is easy to access and works without dislodging the earpiece.  Volume control button is on the top (worn on left ear) or bottom (worn on right ear) and works well.  However, I do tend to hit that button when holding the device to push the call button.  Maybe with some practice I can figure out how to do it without hitting the volume control.  I have a smaller than average head for an adult female so it has been quite a challenge finding ear hooks and ear pieces that don't fall off.  This in-ear piece fits perfectly!!

Poor results with these.First, I paired the headset with my Motorola W766 cell phone. This is an old fashioned ""dumb"" phone. Pairing was dead simple. However, the two devices would disconnect and then immediately re-connect every few minutes. Eventually, the two devices would fail to reconnect. This was 100% reproducible. I phoned up Motorola tech support and their rep. stated that this headset is intended for use only with Android. She offered no further suggestions.I paired the headset with a Windows XP PC that uses the latest WIDCOMM Bluetooth software. Pairing was a bit flaky. I had to re-pair several times while testing.I also obtained flaky results pairing with my Apple iPod Touch (latest model).It is too bad, because this headset delivered the best sound quality that I have experienced so far. What I have to compare with are the Motorola H17, and two Plantronics headsets. This headset also features Motorola's ""flip"" design, which is excellent. Most headsets require you to hold down a button for a second or two to turn the thing on or off. With Motorola's design, you simply flip the headset open or closed, and it only takes a fraction of a second. One or two seconds does not sound like much. But if your daily routine includes unlocking your car, putting sunglasses on, putting seatbelt on, etc. then it all adds up.

I uploaded a picture comparing this headset with theJawbone ICON-Series Thinker Bluetooth Headset (Black)to illustrate my point.  The problem is that the speaker for this headset is almost flush with the part that sits on your cheek. I tried every one of the different ear hooks and gels, but none of them made the headset feel secure (like it wasn't just going to fall off if I did anything other than sit perfectly still) or gave a good seal so the sound transmitted well and blocked out environmental sounds.The problem is that there is no clearance for your tragus (Google ""ear tragus"" to understand which part of the ear this is) to fit between the outer edge of the speaker/ear gel and the inner edge of the body of the headset (the black part).  I wasn't expecting the same noise cancellation or sound fidelity you get with a good pair of in-ear-monitor headphones, but it felt like someone was holding the ELITE FLIP an inch away from my head in terms of sound transmission and I wouldn't dare walk around without holding this in place with my hand, completely defeating the whole hands-free concept.I have never had a headset fit this poorly, and have never even considered this particular design flaw, but now that I have had this experience, I will definitely look more closely at the product pictures for all future headsets.

This one looked promising, but I just could not get it to work.Fit:  Great!  It's tiny, light, and very comfortable.  It comes with options for over-ear, in-ear, or some combination.  I used the over-ear and found it comfortable, although it has a tendency to lose position easily.  Otherwise, very comfortable and pretty secure.Call quality:  Good, but callers told me there was some static.  I also noticed callers sounded a little ""distant"" and tinny.Form factor:  Sleek, tiny, and with a nice folding feature to turn the unit on/off.  Buttons are intuitive and pretty easy to use, although people with bigger fingers may have some trouble.Ease of use:  Here's where this one failed.  From reading the manual, the voice commands (like ""call [number]"") only work for texting, although I couldn't get even that much to work to find out.  You can only use this feature if you download the enormous (beta!) app to your phone, but it force-closed on me twice and then failed to actually work the third time.  I also couldn't get the headset settings commands to work at all.  I read through the limited troubleshooting that came with the device with no results, and the Motorola support website didn't even have this device listed.If you plan to only use this by manually dialing your phone, this is a comfortable, slick headset with decent sound quality.

B005PVXIWQ,A3PWPNZVMNX3PA,rareoopdvds,"[1, 5]","This simple MOTOROLA ELITE FLIP Bluetooth Headset is a quick and simple device that sounds great.A few notes, that once you remove it, it will need to be charged as the device is not functional yet. There is an adapter that plugs into the wall and then a small USB into the device. No biggie, but for me this was annoying as I wanted to use it out of the box. But thats just me. Once its charged, the phone itself is sort of ""curled"" over. This is the ""FLIP"" part that the item refers to. Once you flip that, it serves as an 'on-off switch'. Turning it on, a female voice will trigger a welcome and then tell you how much talk time is allowed. At full charge, you have about 6 hours to talk time.I have an iPhone 4 that paired up quickly to the device and was easy to make a call from there.I gave it 4 stars for a few reasons. The first is that I really had trouble getting the phone in my ear. It could have been my own idiocy that I could not figure out how to wrap it around me ear, or that it just was not designed in the way that is obvious. I believe the former to be more true, but it was a frustration nonetheless.Second is that bluetooth has not really been a good energy saver, in my opinion. Six hour talk time is really small, not to mention it also pulls a lot of battery power off the phone. As always, my phone gets very hot when I have the bluetooth settings on. I do heavy texting, lots of internet use in additional to talking on the phone and so to have all of that pulling on battery power, it really takes a lot out of my phone and potentially reducing talk time in the process. It is useful to have a USB port set up in your car to have continual charge to counteract this issue, even if it just maintains the level its at, but ultimately, bluetooth devices need a lot of attention. Flipping the phone in ""off"" position should help counteract some of the time/energy issues, but if you are driving around a lot, flipping it on and off would probably be a wasted step after a while. I dont imagine someone using these devices outside of the car, so I am not sure how necessary it is. I am not sure how it affects other phones, but this has been my experience.Otherwise, once its up and running, it sounds clean and clear and the person on the other side has no problem hearing me. There is little peripheral sounds which is nice and brings the person you are talking to the forefront of your hearing.So the few things I found an issue with are not so much the device itself, which I think works very well, but more against the technology and its relationship it creates with the phone. But it certainly serves its purpose.

I had hoped that this would work as an in-ear unit since it was so light, I thought I wouldn't have any problems, but no luck for me.The thing that always concerns me is sound quality when it comes to Bluetooth headsets.  I realize that some of the sound quality issues has to do with the phone, but most has to deal with the headset.  I have had an excellent experience with this headset.  As far as what I hear on my end, it is great.  The volume can be raised to a loud enough level that I can hear well when I am in a louder vehicle cab. I really do notice the noise cancellation technology making a difference compared to other headsets I have used.  I hear people very clearly in often noisy environments.The only drawback is that sometimes people say I am hard to hear or that I sound distant.  I have tried re-positioning things to make it better but it appears to be hit or miss.  Sometimes people can hear me clearly, other times is sound very distant.  My only complaint.Of course the unit is easy to use, flip open to turn on, flip close to turn off.  The talk button is a little flimsy to use and hard to press down, but the headset does allow for voice activation for answering calls, so that is what I use most of the time.Battery life is extremely good, I can almost go a week with using the unit while driving and not need to recharge.I can speak much to the roaming distance since I am often not much farther than 10 feet from my phone.So all in all I do recommend this unit.  I would give 5 stars but the audio quality problems on the other end of the line cost one star.If you have any questions I would be happy to answer since I use the unit daily, just leave a comment and I will try to get back to you.",4.0,1334620800,"04 17, 2012",Motorola ELITE FLIP Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Silver,29.9,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41UxF24ocYL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1360},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories', 'Computer Components']]"

The sound started getting a little hazy when I walked from the stairs into my kitchen, and I realized my phone was in the car (past the stairs, the walls, my car).The most I've ever talked on this phone in a single conversation is 5 hours with enough juice to have other shorter conversations later.  I've left it unplugged on my counter for up to 9 days without needing a charge (reported standby time is 12 days but I've never tested that).  It is VERY easy to turn on...all you do is flip the microphone down and an automated voice will indicate how much talk time is remaining (fold in the microphone to turn off the headset). This is important to me so I can alternate between my phone and headset with greater ease.This Motorola is a very lightweight earpiece, and it's great after leaving my job in a call center where we use heavier Plantronics headsets.  I prefer the ear hook but there's a soft earpiece you can use instead.  The response to voice commands is nice too.  You can say ""answer"" or ""ignore"" with incoming calls.The best BT headset I've ever had.  I've gone through BT from Plantronics, BlueAnt, Samsung, and a cheapter Motorola model.

My key features were a comfortable &#34;in ear&#34; ear piece, good distance so i can walk around the house, good battery life, and clarity for people on the other end. It was paired with my Motorola Droid MAXX.None of the ear pieces are comfortable.  The &#34;over the ear&#34; ones seem to hold the speak too far away from the ear, such that it is noticeably harder to hear.  Neither of the two sizes of the &#34;in ear&#34; ear pieces fit me well; the big one is too big and the little one doesn't stay in during moderate movement.  I tried using my Jabra ear piece, but its ID is just a little too large for the OD of the speaker.The usable distance is somehow worse than with the old Jabra.  Maybe 20 ft with one wall between.  Even without a wall, the distance is not impressive.  Sometimes it doesn't pair with my phone even though I have my phone in my hands.The battery life is good.

For the life of me I can't figure out why these Chinese can mangle up such a simple design concept.  If it's not the build quality, it's the software.  If it's not the software, it's the operational use.  If it's not operational, it's the documentation.  Or the battery.  Or weird behavior.  Or annoying ""features"".  There's always SOMEthing completely screwed up, left out, incompatible or just broken right out of the box.  And Motorola doesn't hold the patent for screwed up engineering of Bluetooth headsets.  Wait till you try to get a new Plantronics to work with an iPhone 5.I had lots of high hopes for this one.  Couldn't wait for it to get here.  Charged it up, but quickly found out it doesn't have a standard USB charge port.  You HAVE to put it in it's proprietary little case, then plug the case into USB.  Which means you got to carry the case around wherever you go or it'll never get charged.  Then there's the incessant beeping - and nobody - I mean nobody including Motorola tech support knows why it beeps at you every 5 secs.  Sometimes while on mute it'll beep every 5 secs.  Sometimes when it's not in ""wide range mode"" it'll beep every 5 secs.  Sometimes when there's more than one device nearby it'll beep.  But beep at you it will, to the point you can't even use it.  One time a fully charged unit started beeping at me about 15 mins into the call.  It showed a full charge.  A cohort has one and says he has the same problem, and went back to his Jabra.The only people that know why/when it'll beep at you are the software engineers, and they're all in China.  And unreachable behind communist walls.  And it's not documented anywhere - even internally according to tech support.  But it *IS* a feature of some sort they think.This little headset had potential - it has a surprisingly good fit.  But the button management is just stupid.  Hold the ""smart"" button (just above the volume buttons) and it'll go on mute.  If you don't hold it just long enough, it'll cut off the call.  The bottom button does different things at different times - but usually serves to cut off the unit mid-talk.  Miss the volume button(s) and you'll hit the smart button and again and unknowingly shut off the call.  I was hosting about 20 people on a concall and every time I'd touch the volume it it would hang up, and all 20 of us would get cut off.  One by one we'd join in again, and if I touched it it'd hang up again.  I gave up.I bet they had high hopes for this unit too - probably until some idiotic project manager related to some VP took over and ruined the idea.

I'll emphasize little, because it has a low profile that hides most of the device behind the ear with a small piece that wraps around to the ear canal.The carrying case/charger is a brilliant idea and works flawlessly.A handy feature that I only discovered with use is that turning the ear piece powers the device on and off, thus engaging and severing the bluetooth connection in the process. It's a logical way to do things, but I'll admit that I wasn't expecting it and was pleased to discover it. Another nice feature is the announcement of hours of talk-time remaining whenever I pair the headset to my phone. This leaves no question about when I need to recharge.The sound quality is top notch, but the most common critique I've received from those on the other end is that it sounds like I have them on speaker phone. This makes sense given the microphone's placement behind my ear, but is a bit disappointing nonetheless. While I haven't tested the claim that the headset can work up to 300 feet away from the phone, I have tested it at closer to 60 feet with a few walls separating the phone and headset.

B005PVXKC4,A25CGBLRJB6X0S,Brass Monkey,"[2, 3]","The Motorola Elite Sliver has been an entirely new experience for me and honestly, I find myself using using my bluetooth headset more now then ever because it's so much more convenient to use then my last one (5+ years old, came with my Razer), way more comfortable to wear, and the sound quality is superb - I can actually hear the person on the other line.For starters, the case that this headset arrives in is very slick.  It has a built in battery charger for your headset on the go and (if I understood the instructions correctly...) the case itself has some abilities to synch the headset to your phone by touch however, I don't believe my phone has the necessary technology for this to work (iPhone 3GS).  No worries though because synching this headset couldn't have been easier.  You just power it on and then seek out the bluetooth device in your phone's settings.  Slightly embarrassed to say that it took me a little while to figure out how to wear this bluetooth (you twist the ear piece so the large speaker part of the headset can slide up and behind your ear) and also how to turn it off (it turns off automatically when you twist the ear piece back into it's resting position as shown in the case).The only reason why I gave this a four star rating is because although I can hear the person on the other line crystal clear, I've been told quite a few times that my line seemed fuzzy or I seemed muffled when I've used this headset.  In fact, my boyfriend can tell without fail when I'm using my headset or not based on the sound quality of my line.  And although this may simply be an issue with my own comprehension of the instructions enclosed, I kind of feel that they were too vague.  I'm still not 100% sure what the little button on the headset does (other then make little beeping noises in my ear) and it's luck of the draw if I get the big button to do what I want it to do at the opportune time.Overall though, I love this headset.  It works and it's so comfortable!  My last headset always felt like it was on the verge of falling off or it would start to hurt my ear after wearing it for longer then 10 minutes.  This headset I could easily wear all day long and forget about it and it is super discreet with the bulk of it hidden behind your ear.

B005PVXKC4,A18VCM7Y7HK6EW,Chris,"[2, 2]","Very nice design overall. It pairs very easily w/iphone4S and turns on/off and connects with a twist of the earpiece (no separate switch, so that's a very nice feature). With some headsets you have to press a switch for a couple of seconds before it turns on (never quite figured that out, why do you want to press a button for that long ?).  Very comfortable and light.  Sound quality is also very good.  The charging/storage case is aesthetically pleasing.  The color scheme is neat, it's a black casing (soft to the touch) with ""metallic"" gray/black on the earpiece stem, so it's a really nice bit of a contrast. The only cons are: 1. Some people may think it looks like a hearing aid, 2. If something happens to the case, you're out of luck because you have to have it to charge the unit.  I think Motorola could have somehow put a charging port on the headset, although the odds of something happening to the case are slim to none).  3. The caller ID only tells you the number and it takes a while to say it, which in the meantime your phone has rung at least three times.  Motorola needs a firmware upgrade to state the name if it's available.  I use it while driving my Corolla and my wife says she can hear me just fine.Update 2/1: Still think it's a nice headset, but Motorola is misleading the user into thinking it has voice dialing. Well...it actually interacts with the phone's voice dial, so it's not built into the headset.  For it to be built-in, it would have to import the phonebook, and this thing doesn't do that. Also, don't know if it's just me, but I noticed that the LED in the charging case goes from green to red a few seconds after inserting the headset, and I've never seen the LED go yellow.  Called Motorola to ask if that's normal, but their ""tech"" support is not much help at all with more involved questions like that, and they say that's the only level of suppport they have.  So...my question will probably remain unanswered until I get another headset.Update 2/27: Forgot to mention..it seemed to me like this headset actually goes to ""sleep"" (power save) if worn but not used for a while. Several times I noticed my phone would ring, but only after the first ring did it transfer to the headset. Also, I tried pushing the button to activate Siri on my iphone (yes, it did work with Siri), but the first time I pressed the call button, nothing happened.  Had to press it again to wake it up.  Not the biggest deal, but it can make you wonder what's going on, in large part because Motorola does not mention a whole lot of operational detail in either their website or their owner's manual.  If these things are ""fixed"", I may buy it again.  I think this sleep mode is a big part of why the battery life seems to be so good.  Still think it's nice, but Motorola needs to inform users COMPLETELY on how this thing operates.  I downgraded my rating to 3 stars due to Motorola's lack of info...",3.0,1327190400,"01 22, 2012",Motorola ELITE SLIVER Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,51.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZH858oZyL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 5424},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B005PVXKC4,A2BMZRO0H7TFCS,Ed,"[1, 1]","It's hard to get excited about a Bluetooth headset anymore. There are so many to choose from and you can only do so much to a tiny little device. Every once in a while, though, a headset will come along with a distinctive design and a feature-set that stands out from the rest. The Motorola ELITE SLIVER is such a device and my new primary headset.PROS:- Great audio quality- Good battery life (5 hours of talk time)- Charging case provides an additional 10 hours of talk time- Good noise cancellation- 300ft range for Class 1 phones (30ft for Class 2)- Stylish appearance- Comfortable fit- Android app adds additional featuresCONS:- Volume control goes in steps- Thin on accessories- PriceyPAIRINGPairing the SLIVER to an HTC Droid Incredible 2 the old-fashioned way was simple and familiar. The SLIVER also supports Multipoint (2 devices) pairing. The interesting thing about the SLIVER is that it supports pairing via Near Field Communications (NFC) too. To pair using NFC, you just take the SLIVER (in the case) and touch an NFC-enabled phone. That's it.FITAs I've stated many times over in past headset reviews, a headset's fit is one of the most important features for me. It has to be easy to put on and it has to stay on. The SLIVER comes with a selection of ear gels to optimize fit and comfort. I found it to be very comfortable to wear and is the first Bluetooth headset I've reviewed in which the bulk of the headset rests behind my ear lobe. At just 9 ounces, I barely feel the SLIVER on my ear.Initially, I needed to use both hands to put the SLIVER on. I eventually got used to slipping it on one-handed but it definitely requires more effort than my trusty Jabra EXTREME. I don't like wearing headsets unless I'm actually using them, which is why the headsets that I leave in my car are easy to put on. I keep the headsets that require a little more effort to put on for home/office use. It's also worth mentioning that the SLIVER's earpiece swivels in both directions so that it can be worn on either ear.CALL QUALITYThe call quality of the ELITE SLIVER was very good on both ends. The caller on the other end came in very clear and I had no problems with the volume. The SLIVER's noise canceling technology is referred to as CrystalTalk, which uses dual microphones. I was told by callers that they could hear me well, even when I was driving on the highway. My Toyota 4Runner doesn't have the quietest interior cabin, so a headset with good noise cancellation is a must for me.MUSICThe ELITE SLIVER supports advanced audio distribution profile (A2DP), which means that you can stream music and GPS directions from your phone to the headset. Many Bluetooth headsets support A2DP but most of them don't perform that well with music. If you spend a lot of time listening to music with your phone, you need to seriously give the SLIVER a listen, because it's the best sounding Bluetooth mono headset I've ever heard. I wouldn't throw out your hi-fi stereo headphones, but at low to medium volume levels, the SLIVER is a joy to use with music. I streamed music from Google Music, Spotify and Pandora and enjoyed the wireless freedom.BATTERY & CHARGINGThe SLIVER is rated for 5 hours of talk time on its own. When you factor in the charging case, you can get up to 15 hours of talk time and 35 days of standby! The body of the charging case is made out of matte plastic, with a glossy, semi-translucent plastic lid. There really isn't much to the case. It has a micro-USB port for charging and that's pretty much it. On the downside, only a dedicated wall charger is included in the box. For such an expensive and high-end headset, I was a little surprised that Motorola didn't include a USB cable with separate wall and car chargers. Still, because the headset uses a micro-USB port for charging, there's a good chance that you already have chargers and cables that are compatible.BUTTONSThe SLIVER has just two physical buttons. The smart(multifunction) button controls the volume, turns mute on/off, activates the Android My Motospeak app, and rejects calls. Of course, like most advanced headsets, you can use your voice to answer and reject calls. The other button on the SLIVER is the call button, which can launch your phone's voice dialing feature, redial, answer a call, and end a call. Both buttons were easy to use and responsive. My only gripe is that I prefer separate volume buttons, rather than having a single multifunction button that cycles through volume levels.MY MOTOSPEAKMy Motospeak is the Android app by Motorola that allows you to customize the SLIVER and send text messages by voice. To activate My Motospeak, you just hit the smart button, then it asks you to ""say a command."" You can tell the app to call or text someone at that point. Texting worked OK, but I wouldn't rely on it for lengthy messages. It's a nice option for short SMS messages though, like, ""running late"" or ""should I pick up milk?"" The app also allows you to change the headset equalizer but the default setting sounded best to me. You can also customize the noise cancellation to different environments, but I don't foresee users modifying it from the default. The app also does a decent job of reading back new text messages to you while driving. It's worth installing the app for sure, but I wouldn't get the SLIVER just for the app support. My Motospeak is available from both the Android Market and the Amazon Appstore.SUMMARYThe Motorola ELITE SLIVER is one of the most advanced Bluetooth headsets I've ever used. If that weren't enough, it's also the best sounding headset I've ever heard. Voice calls, GPS directions and music, all sounded excellent. The charging case is a great convenience for storage/protection and boosts talk time for up to 10 additional hours. The stylish SLIVER is also easy to use, comfortable, and fits well.  If you're looking for an advanced Bluetooth headset, give the Motorola ELITE SLIVER a go.",4.0,1353369600,"11 20, 2012",Motorola ELITE SLIVER Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,51.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZH858oZyL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 5424},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

Almost like a very hard static.  With my iPhone 3Gs I thought it was because my phone was old and I had dropped it a few times.  But when I paired this headset with my iPhone 4s I (at times) heard the same thing.  The good thing is that it doesn't completely shut the app like it did with the 3Gs.  It's just a few seconds of hard static and then it goes back to the music.  It HAS NOT done this with phone calls.  I don't know if this is an iPhone pairing thing or what but I find it hard to believe that two phone could be experiencing the exact same problem************************Ahhhhh... the wonder of technology.  When I first opened the package I was thinking, ""how in the world can this device pick up my freaking voice""?  One part goes in my ear and the other part wraps BEHIND my ear.  How in the... ?  Well, once I got over trying to figure it out and started using it I was very, very, very happy.  Just for reference I use an iPhone 3Gs and an iPad 2.  I think I read somewhere this is best used for Android phones.  I only found one instance where having an Android phone with this device is ""better"", but I'll get to that in a minute:Charging: charging items are usually a boring and little thought of aspect to electronic devices.  Not so with this one (at least with me).  Not only does this wireless headset hold a good charge, but even if you were to run it down all you would have to do is put it in its case.  The CASE is the charger!  How cool is that?  The case itself is very small and can easily fit in a purse or even your front pocket.  When you do (finally) run out of power all you do is place the headset in the case and plug the case in the wall.  The specs say that we have up to 15 hours of talk time with the case.  I have yet to get anywhere close to that, but I love the fact that I can just grab the case and go and not have to worry about lugging around yet another cord.  The bad news is that if you lose the case, you lost the ability to charge your headset.Pairing: very easy.  When you put on the headset you get prompts from the lady in the sky on how to pair it.  I didn't need to use the pass code to pair it for either of my devices but she does give you one should you need it.  I did pair it with my iPad 2 but since I don't think you're supposed to(?) it recognized it as  ""phone 1"".  To once you turn it off or put it back in its case linking up is automatic as long as your device has the setting to ""on"".  The lady in the sky also let you know once you are connected or become disconnected.Call clarity: VERY good.  I walk my kids to and from school every day.  It's about a 50 minute round trip and I am able to hear my callers even on the busy stretch of road. In the house or in the Jeep it's even better because I don't have that outside noise to worry about.  You can use the buttons on the headset to adjust volume, end calls, and start calls (if you have voice activation on your mobile device).  This device is also a good fit because it wraps around your ear like a glove.  I never had to adjust while I was out walking.Music:  Since this is a wireless headset you are able to listen to music as well.  BONUS!  This is my first Bluetooth headset and I felt like I hit pay dirt when I found this out.  Sometimes it's the small things and not having to fight with cords as I'm getting the kids ready or trying to find some misplaced item in my Jeep is one of them.Battery power: no complaints whatsoever.  I will admit that I'm not a phone hog but I do listen to music a lot and I've never gotten close to running out of power, especially since I use the charged case.The Android connection: I wanted to use the `My MotoSpeak' but that is only for Android phones.  With the app you can hear text and reply to texts.  I guess since the iPhone has Siri Motorola might have felt the need to not make one for iOS devices.  But for folks like me who don't have the iPhone 4s, it would be nice to have that option.  But that's small cheese when you take this device as a whole.

The case uses a micro USB charger to charge and it has two little lights within that glow nicely to tell the charging state of the case and the headset.  It charges the headset first, then the case battery.The controls are real simple.  When you move the earpiece it turns the headset on and announces how much charge time you have.  When you turn it inwards it turns the headset off.If your call coming in has caller ID the headset announces the number.  You can answer the call by merely saying answer or ignore.  There is a mute control as well.The headset comes with a number of plastic rings to fit your ear.  It fits well and there is no protruding microphone that I always seem to have trouble with.All in all I highly recommend this headset and plan to use it as my preferred choice.",5.0,1320105600,"11 1, 2011",Motorola ELITE SLIVER Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,51.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZH858oZyL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 5424},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

Karazim,"[0, 1]","I had been using the Motorola H710 for the last couple of years, and while it was decent in its own right, I could not seem to squeeze out more than 4-5 hours without a re-charge, even when it was new.  I would get tons of echo and I could not travel far from my phone without losing functionality.  People complained all the time that they had a hard time hearing me.Not so with the Elite Silver!  Pairing to my iPhone 4 was a snap, I didn't even need to put in a code, just turned on the headset after charging it and it paired to the phone immediately.  I love the command functions.  I didn't think they would work well, as my experiences with voice commands always seem to be lukewarm.  I like just being able to say ""answer"" if I have my hands in something, like doing dishes or whatever, so I don't need to touch the headset at all.  You can also say ""ignore"" if you don't want to answer the call.  I have not figured out how to use it with call waiting other than pressing a button.  I guess the voice commands only work with the first call, which makes sense.  The headset also works great for listening to music/streaming audio etc., although some songs you need to have something in both ears to get the full effect from the song.You can pair this with two different devices, so my husband has it paired to his phone as well, although he did need to enter the code 0000.I have found that the battery does last almost 15 hours as the product claims.  I can't say anything for the standby time because I never leave it alone for long enough!  I like that the charger is also a carrying case as it makes it easier to find in my purse and keeps dust, dirt, and moisture from coming in contact with the headset when charging and not in use.  The H710 just charged with a regular charging cable and it was easily lost.Great headset!

B005PVXKC4,A1S5KB9FYUSKIQ,Moheroy,"[13, 15]","I have been using this headset for almost two weeks now and that has given me some time to form some pretty firm opinions.First, I am using the headset with an IPhone 4.The unit is very well made, good build quality, with sturdy construction.  It fits very comfortably on either ear, you turn kit on by rotating the earpiece and the startup sequence is very pleasant.The headset comes in a case that also serves as a charger, the case has an internal battery that charges the headset even when the case is not plugged in.  This is a fantastic feature as it extends the life of the headset dramatically, even without charging in the case you can talk for almost 5 hours, and the case charge adds hours more.  The case is also very well built, and very easy to carry around.  I usually lose cases, but this one goes in my pocket whenever I know I will be on the road all day.The range is, as advertised, about 50 feet give or take, though it depends on building construction.  It can be linked to two devices, I linked to both my phone and laptop.  One problem, that seems inherent with all Bluetooth devices, is that it has had to be resynced twice.  I have no idea why and this is very annoying.  However the process is pretty painless.The sound in the earpiece is excellent, but the microphone has some trouble, even in quiet environments.  The sound is muddy, and loses clarity.  This is my chief complaint, and can get quite annoying.  When speaking to those with any hearing difficulties it becomes almost mpossible and you have to use the phone without the headset, but most people can hear it relatively clearly.This is by far the best headset I have used, but it is still somewhat limited.",4.0,1320364800,"11 4, 2011",Motorola ELITE SLIVER Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,51.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZH858oZyL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 5424},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

Even though that Jabra Stone is about 3 years older than this current Motorola Sliver, the Jabra Stone wins hands down. In this review I will compare both.PairingThis Bluetooth is super easy to pair and use. You can simply tap your phone and the Motorola Charger and you are done. I did the regular pairing with the code and it was simple as well.Design/FitThe fit and design of the Jabra Stone is excellent. It fits snuggly and has a slick design that was not cumbersome. In contrast, this Motorola Blue tooth is too big for my ears (average sized ears) and it cannot be adjusted. The design is clunky and heavy on your ear. Because of the weight and fit, the bluetooth has often fallen or slipped off my ear. Even during action as simple as taking off my coat.Talk FeaturesIt about the worst I have used. For several minutes I tried to ""Call Mom"" or ""Text Mom"" and other simple commands and the Bluetooth was not able to pick up a single one. Instead, it directed my phone to call people I had not spoken to in years. It was very embarrassing. Moreover, if you have even the slightest accent, this feature is even worse at picking up what you say.Charge/Talk TimeThis is the only good thing about this Bluetooth. It holds a 5 hour talk time charge and has a carrier that recharges your phone, even when not plugged in. The battery will last you forever.OverallI regret my decision to get rid of my Jabra Stone. I want it back.

B005PVXKC4,AS8C336DDLSO4,"Mr. Ben ""ctsamurai""","[2, 4]","I recieved this headset as a Vine offer, and I do not normall use or require a headset. But I have to say that I was very pleased with it. First off, the thing looks pretty cool. Its not as sleek as a lot of Jawbone or plantronics headsets, but I like this over the ear look. The earpiece definitely is noticable and you probably won't forget that you're wearing it, but it was comfortable for hours of wear and its over the ear design keeps in place when you move your head around. Another nice bonus: no ""idiot light""! There is a blue LED that indicates certain activity, but it does not incessantly blink like other headsets. I never had any complaints on calls with it, and it does allow a certain amount of hands free manipulation (though I wasn't able to test this, since my phone setup is a little complicated):About the phone I used with it: Its a Samsung (Google) Nexus S. Running Android Cyanogenmod 7 (yeah, i'm one of those guys). I did try the NFC pairing feature, but the phone didn't know what to do with the NFC tag. It recognized it immediately, but it didn't launch anything. Fortunately the normal blue tooth pairing process is only slightly slower. The voice on the headset rather loudly proclaims ""Phone 1 connected"" and that's all there is to it. I could listen to music, speak voice commands, it all sounded and worked quite well.Battery life was quite good, though I never wore it long enough to drain it, and I don't use my phone for voice communication. But I was also able to pair the phone with my MacBook, where I do make calls. Again, the bluetooth setup process was fairly quick and painless and I was able to communicate with Google Voice and even tried recording it a few times to check the sound quality. Again, sound quality was pretty good, but when paired with the MacBook there were some fairly subtly pops- not quite static sounding and the sound was actually clearer than the onboard mic, but it could be a little distracting.The final great feature is the carrying case that also functions as a small recharge station (which Motorola touts as allowing up to 15 hours of ""talk time""). When fully charged, the headset gives you 5 hours of talk time, so that probably means you can get about 3 full recharges just from putting it back in its case. When the case and headset are connected to AC Power, the headset charges first. Overall, I'm very satisfied with its performance (battery life and sound quality), though its only fairly comfortable to wear and at this price, the thing should feel good in the ear which I think Motorola could have done some more work on.",4.0,1321401600,"11 16, 2011",Motorola ELITE SLIVER Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,51.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZH858oZyL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 5424},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

It can easily switch from the left ear to the right ear with just a twist of the ear piece. The sound quality is excellent for both making calls and listening to music on your phone. I have also used the headset to watch videos on my smartphone - occasionally there will be a slight delay between the image on the screen and the sound you hear, but since listening to movies/videos is not one of the advertised purposes of this headset, I don't deduct anything from its rating.My favorite thing about this headset is that the microphone portion of the headset is also located behind the ear, eliminating the need for what I call the ""Britney Spears"" mic - you know the kind that come across the cheek bone or in front of the ear. Those types of microphones are great for popstars, but I prefer a headset that is a little less noticeable.

If you google the issue you'll find multiple examples of the same issue.Motorola's solution is to reset the unit. This is done by depressing the call button and turning the unit on/off simultaneously. This worked on my phone for two calls and then the volume spiked again.I'm still waiting for Motorola's response to the re-occurence of the problem. Until the problem is fixed I rate it one star as well.**2nd Problem: Iphone 4S Siri Interface.The Siri interface didn't work well either and the recommended solution was the same as for problem # 1.  When I reset the unit. the Siri interface started working. However, over time (5 activations of Siri) the response time went from normal to 30 seconds to 1 minute for command response and (you guessed it) the volume went to maximum when it did respond.I contacted Motorola and I'm waiting for a solution.

B005PVXKC4,A1YEPFLLH42OU1,"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia ""Yu-Jin Chia""","[1, 2]","The Motorola Elite Sliver is a high-end bluetooth headset. It supports a wide range of functions, including voice instructions and speech recognition, multiple device pairing, music playback, long-range reception, noise cancellation, and quick setup. It also has a case with an integrated battery that charges the headset while stored.Straight up, the headset itself is very light and easy to put on and take off. It's also comfortable when worn even for extended periods. It's easy to turn it off and on- simply twist the earpiece left or right. This also allows it to be worn in whichever ear you prefer.The battery charges quickly- about an hour and a half to full charge. If you count the battery in the case, you get at least 12 hours of talk time on one charge. Note that this isn't continuous, as it means you'll have to put it back in the case at least part of the time. The earpiece itself lasts about 5 hours at a time.Reception range is good, though I'd say the 300 foot range claimed is pretty ridiculous. Perhaps this is only the case with a high end Moto smartphone? At any rate, I don't have one- and with my LG Optimus it dropped out altogether at about 100 feet. Even at around 30 feet, signal strength begins to degrade pretty noticeably and past that it started to stutter pretty seriously. This is especially the case when listening to music.Pairing was very straightforward, and I had no problems doing so with both my Android handset and my Mac Pro. All functions worked straight up as advertised. Music playback picks up seamlessly and pauses on incoming calls. The speech recognition worked well for answering calls. If it doesn't, there's a button you can press, but I found it unnecessary. Unfortunately, the headset doesn't have any voice commands for initiating a call- to do so you have to hit one of the physical buttons. Doing this starts up the device's voice dialer, assuming it has one. Overall, both the microphone pickup and audio reception while making calls was good. Music quality is likewise decent, though I'll admit I'm one of those people that can't really stand listening to it in one ear. Noise cancellation is all right- not amazing but about what you'd expect from an earpiece that also has to be easy to put on.I did have some problems using Skype with this headset. It worked when I selected it as my primary I/O device, but for some reason after every call it threw a Bluetooth error and disconnected. The call quality was also mediocre; it stuttered continually and at times was barely understandable. I don't have the same problems with my laptop's built-in mic and audio and don't have any problems with other BT devices, so it probably was a compatibility issue with the headset (possibly on Skype's part since this one's pretty new).Design-wise, the earpiece is made of flexible rubberized plastic. It appears decently rugged and isn't huge or obnoxious in appearance like some other bluetooth headsets I've seen. Overall, I'd say this is definitely one of the better ones on the market, and is pretty solid all around for voice calls.Pros:Pairing is very easy, voice instructions walk you through it.Voice quality is clear, pickup is good.Comfortable and compact.Long battery life, fast charge.Charging case is a nice touch.Con:Not nearly as much range as Motorola claims.Doesn't seem to play well with Skype.",4.0,1320019200,"10 31, 2011",Motorola ELITE SLIVER Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,51.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZH858oZyL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 5424},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B005YVTHF4,A1ELF4U3EOUV9F,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","I bought this dock for my Droid Razr because I thought ""Hmm.  OEM accessory.  Ok, it should work fine.""  In concept this thing is a great idea, and I would recommend it hands down if not for two major flaws.1) My unit worked fine for five months or so, but then it started shorting out the micro USB chargers I plugged into it (first the charger which came with it, and then two other chargers I had lying around).  I think it has a defective ground inside or something.  In any case I am lucky that the dock only ate up chargers and did not short my phone or something.2) If you keep a protective case on your phone, you have to take it off to use the dock.  Even though the Droid Razr is meant to take a great deal of abuse (which is why I bought it), I still try to keep my Otterbox case on it.  I find it annoying and unnecessary that I have to remove the case.  Seriously, couldn't Motorola just make a small adapter for the dock?  I mean you only need to have access to the HDMI and USB port on the phone, and you're golden.  I would be willing to pay an extra $5 or so for them to include an adapter in the package which would allow me to keep my phone in its protective case.Otherwise this is a solid little unit.  If those two flaws were addressed by Motorola, I would give this 5 stars with no hesitation.

So theoretically with a TV and computer speakers you have a little home theater that fits in the palm of your hand! Unfortunately they got rid of the two USB ports before sending it to production.  These would have come in handy on the road!  Hotel rooms never seem to have enough 110 outlets, and I always have to bring to 110-USB adapters.  You could use the other USB for a keyboard and to charge an ipad, but c'est la vi.

I previously had a docking station for my Droid X and loved it so much I bought a second one so I had on for  my desk and bedside table.  So, when I upgraded to my Droid Razr, a docking station was the first accessory I wanted.I got this as a Christmas gift, along with my phone.  And I couldn't get the phone to connect to it.  With 2 connectors, which don't seem to be quite straight, getting them to go into the holes in the top of the phone was impossible, no matter how hard I tried!  Once in a while, with some fluke of angle, it would go in the holes and work just fine, doing what a docking station should have (though I preferred the software setup that came with my Droid X docking station).However, as soon as I took the phone out of the docking station (which is really hard to do without touching the screen and starting something you don't want to touch!), I was back to square one struggling to get it inserted.Because I thought maybe I had a defective one, and because it had been a gift, so I didn't have the necessary receipt to return it, I bought a second one, figuring I'd be able to return the first as defective (it was from the same seller) once the second one was delivered...only, guess what? Same problem with the second one!  No matter how carefully I tried to push it into the holes on top of the phone, it took 5 minutes every time!  Having to be so careful not to accidentally break the connectors off in the phone.  This time, though, I finally figured out what the perfect angle is to get it lined up to one of the connectors and then gently push down on it to force it to straighten a bit so the second connector would line up with the second hole.

B005YVTHF4,A2I2A7N3OCPNW4,"T. A. Daniel ""Alex""","[1, 1]","Right now, I kind of have a love hate relationship with the HD Dock.  To put simply, it does exactly what it's supposed to, but it is bogged down in a clunky interface.THE GOOD:Like I said, the HD Dock does exactly as it is advertised.  Once you plug in your DROID RAZR, a screen prompts you to decide how you would like to treat your docking station.  Would you like it as a bedside clock?  Enabling this option grants a large time display coupled with a few music options.  Would you like it as an office call center?  Enabling this option creates a few icons to allow for quick and easy communication (phone, text, group meetings, etc...)  It looks really nice, and it charges the phone well.  If you sit at a desk during the day, this is a nice little accessory to own.THE BAD:Unfortunately, a few interface design choices offer clunky use with the HD Dock.  This dock forces your phone into the aforementioned modes, but if you want to use your phone as its normal interface, you may as well just disconnect it from its station.  If you need to access your calendar, or any other app, you will need to repeatedly press the Back button until you come to your original homescreen.  Using the touchscreen while in its docking station also proves to be a little annoying; it's much much easier to browse the internet on the phone via handheld methods as opposed to this.I'm puzzled as to why this is labeled ""Rapid Wall Charger;"" my phone seems to take much longer to charge using this station than it does by simply plugging it into the wall.  The lack of customization options also proves to be really annoying after using the device for a while; users have to operate by what Motorola think you do in your office (or whatever interface option you have chosen).THE HUH?:No USB connection options?  This limits consumers to only being able to use wall/AC Adapter plugins to provide power to this station.  While the options that the phone provides regarding interface are fine (Office, Bedside Clock, etc...), I would have liked to see some kind of customization with this feature.  For example, for music, you will need to rely on Motorola's music service -- you can't enable Google Music or Amazon MP3 for instance without exiting out of the dock options entirely.OVERALL:This device is fine.  At $25+, it's not exactly a bargain, but it's worth the money if you spend a lot of time at a desk.

It is much lighter than a smartphone, but as with the touchpad, the main button to use the phone feature is so sensitive that it is possible to click it accidentally, hanging up.  Pairing the device was easy enough once I realized it was listed as two separate items -basically one for audio and one for the mouse.  It has the standard menu/home/back/search buttons you would expect from an Android device as well as volume and mute.All things considered, it is a lot of money for a device with pretty limited unique usefulness, unless the first thing you do when you get home each night is connect your phone to the charging station and the TV.",3.0,1334707200,"04 18, 2012",Motorola Bluetooth Smart Controller for Android - Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,19.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31HHR46GQwL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 62503},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"

The product listing indicates that it's compatible with most Android devices supporting HID - not true. Motorola's own site shows it only works with a subset of Motorola smartphones (and another reviewer finds it works on his Samsung, which isn't listed in their compatibility list). It doesn't work with any of the HTC phones I tried. Even the QR code on the side of the packaging resolves to a 404 Error since nobody bothered to either build the page or check the code being published on a widely released retail product.The product and support information is among some of the worst I've seen for any non-beta electronic product. A 3""x4"" manual comes with the product and provides the briefest overview of what the device can do. It doesn't even mention how to pair with a television. Searching the web, there's very little information and even Motorola's own site page (bizarrely not indexed in Google) only repeats the contents of the manual.It also doesn't ship with a wall charger, only a USB to micro-USB cable. This means that you must have a computer with a USB port if you want to charge it. For taking calls while your phone is charging, the average user would be better buying a Bluetooth headset since this is a bulkier way to take calls.

B0060EKFYG,A33YZNZIRA3H97,l2,"[2, 4]","I am reviewing this device when paired with a Verizon Samsung Galaxy Nexus Android phone. I assume it fully works with recent Motorola Android phones. No idea how well it works with other phones.Motorola is selling a bunch of Android accessory devices that enhance the functionality of their Android smartphones, especially for business users. The Android bluetooth keyboard has special Android-specific function buttons (like the ones you see on your phone). The Android multi-media docks power your phone and have HDMI outputs to connect to a big screen TV. The laptop docks convert your phone into a laptop computer. This ""smart controller"" is another device in this product line.The smart controller is a bluetooth touchpad and with a few smartphone-specific features. On the side, there is a volume control that works just like the volume control on your phone. On the back, there are the 4 standard Android buttons (menu, home, back, search) that work just like the buttons on your phone. Also on the back is a 2 inch square touch-pad that remotely controls your phone's touch screen, except a little differently. One finger drag gestures move a cursor around your screen to you can select specific objects in the Android GUI. Two finger multi-touch gestures move the screen around; scrolling the screen up-and-down or left-and-right. On the front is a telephone handset so you can make or receive voice calls. There is a single phone button to make or end calls.This device paired easily with the Bluetooth on my Galaxy Nexus. All of the advertised features work fine. One finger gestures on the touch pad work easily, though the cursor is blue and can be hard to see if your background is also blue. Two finger gestures take some getting used to, at least if you have fat fingers like me. Phone call quality is pretty good. You can make calls using the touch pad to access your phone's contact list or touch dialer. Or press on the phone button to redial the last number you called (or to pickup an incoming call or end the current call).Do you really need this device? If you have your phone hooked up to a HDTV to watch videos or slideshows or business presentations on a big screen, then this controller is very handy, though of course not everyone is going to do that. If you only do this kind of thing occasionally, the $100 price tag for this device is very expensive. If you already have a bluetooth mouse and bluetooth headset, those will probably give you most of the same functionality.The smart controller has a rechargeable battery that runs for more hours than my phone, so no complaints there.4 stars because this smart controller mostly achieves what it is designed for.

The way you use this is equally simple - pair with your tablet or phone, connect your phone to your TV using its dock or Mini/Micro HDMI cable, then sit back on the sofa and use the Motorola Smart Controller as a remote. Use the mouse to pick a movie, and if a call happens to come in, you can pick it up on the handset. While this sounds absolutely brilliant, it means you get to pay $90 for the luxury of not having to get up and touch your screen or order a $20 headset.If you are into gadgets (and I am), you'll LOVE this thing. I used it last week in a hotel room with my Motorola Xoom - plugged the Xoom into the TV, and when a call came in (using Groove IP, a Google Voice client), I took the call on the controller. So, to me as a geek, this is definitely worth $90 - but to someone less geeky (and less lazy), it may be worthwhile to spend that money on something else...Build quality is good - the mouse responds nicely and the call quality is excellent. Motorola makes excellent headsets, so a good voice quality is to be expected. The Smart Controller charges over microUSB, and a charger is included. One other plus - it has a ""real"" on/off slider switch.Only downsides? It lacks a carrying case/pouch.One other upside? It works on your PC as well! I paired it with my Lenovo and could use it as a mouse and headset with Skype. The buttons did not work right, as they are assigned to Android keys.I tested it on my Xoom, Transformer Prime, Galaxy Nexus and Windows 7 machine. In all cases, it worked as it should.

If you use it for calls, you hold it up to your ear like a phone, but I found it's pretty easy to accidentally hang up on the call too.

Works well if you leave your phone attached to your TV through HDMI out.  I have the cable and have done it a few times with my phone, but I don't normally leave it attached there, nor do I use my phone as a hub for most things.

Search button doesn't seem to do anything useful.- Volume controls the Mac's volume- Pinch features don't work, but multi-touch scrolling does** General Experience **The buttons are nice enough, but an integrated app on the Android device would have been nice so that custom buttons like those relating to media functions could exist.  The mouse cursor is small and slow on Android, which is a major inconvenience.  The speed of the tracking can be changed, but the overall experience is enough of an annoyance to just not use the device with Android.  It was weird having to depress the main button pad as a giant mouse button - I'm used to capacitive touch events.  On a normal computer, if the mouse speed is accelerated, it's pretty tolerable and a neat novelty that gets attention.The vibrator in it is really strong.  Stronger than my Nexus vibrator.  You definitely notice it in the pocket, though the ringer is a bit quiet.If giving a presentation, this works pretty well as a presenter's mouse on a real computer.  An actual ball on top like a trackball would make the use of the mouse a lot nicer, but then there's the tradeoff of the multi-touch.It can charge off the computer's USB power, so that's also a plus.Unfortunately, no Motorola phones or iPad/iPhone/Blackberry available to try, so this was a test of everything else.** Getting the phone functions to work with my Nexus phone **At first it appears that the headset feature is unavailable, but it IS available--it just takes a lot longer for the headset device to become visible.  On the phone, I had to search for devices at least 6 times before the headset device of the RZ100 showed up.  The key is to NOT pair the mouse first.  If it does, there's a good chance it'll stop trying to pair.  Pair the headset first, then search again for devices on the phone and then pair the mouse device.The Galaxy Nexus does not support a button-enabled voice command, but there may be an app that enables that.  So pressing the phone button doesn't do anything.One advantage of using this as a phone with your phone is that you can charge your phone and talk using this device.  This could be really handy if you are on a long conference call, for example.  If your phone batter gets too low, turn this device on and charge the phone.  When this device starts getting low, switch back to the phone and charge this device.  Note that the headset feature does NOT work with music.  Only phone calls.  That's pretty reasonable though.** And the verdict is... **I gave this product 3 stars because it has a nice cool-factor and I can see its benefit as a remote mouse for a computer.  I thought it was a little awkward for use with my Android devices and I'm not sure I would have ever found an every-day use for it.  At this price point, that is certainly something to consider.  Still, I think I WOULD HAVE liked this device overall, EXCEPT...I got one of these as a ""free sample"".  The unit I was given seems to have been abused in transit or something because the touch pad area had scuffs/scratches right out of the box and after only a few hours of use, the unit quit functioning completely.  Amazon has an excellent return policy and if I had purchased this, I know they would have sent a speedy replacement.  However, because it was free and because they don't have any more inventory of free samples to send, then I guess that's all the sample I'll be getting.  I did not take any stars off of this because I don't think it's fair to base an opinion of build quality off of a unit that appears to be a lemon out of the batch of (potentially) good units.",3.0,1332720000,"03 26, 2012",Motorola Bluetooth Smart Controller for Android - Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,19.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31HHR46GQwL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 62503},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"
B006B9GRM4,A3EZEP0FX5BC1P,"A Conrad ""Ask Conrad""","[4, 7]","I received these headphones to test its capabilities as a replacement to my wired headsets.  My favorite wired inner-ear headsets are the Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10, followed closely by the Ultimate Ears 600vi set.I opened the retail packaging to find a quick-start guide sitting on top.  Underneath was the SF600 wireless sports headphone, a bag with 5 sizes of ear cushions, a wall charger (micro USB), and a convenient black travel pouch.  The package Motorola SF600 has ear cushions in five sizes to ensure a secure, comfortable fit no matter what your pace is.  You can use any other micro USB charger to charge the batteries.The selling-point of this headset is the breakthrough HD sound with wireless technology that the manufacturers referred to as headphones that ""deliver crystal clear, pulse-pumping sound quality to keep you focused and motivated through every step of every workout.""  What does that mean?  Well, the Motorola SF600 features advanced HD audio capabilities that include APT-X codec technology that Motorola boasts to match or even the outperform wired headset performance.  Overall, the sound is one of the best I've heard from a bluetooth headset.  However, there are areas that need work.I tested this with an iPhone 4S, iPad2, Blackberry Curve, and a MacBook Pro.If you have the Plantronics Voyager Pro BT headset for you phone, you will have a pretty good idea how these may fit in your ears.  The earbuds sit in the outer ear canal, and you really need to fine which inserts fit best for your size and shape.  Otherwise, the fit will either be too small or too large, and the result is an earbud that will always pop out of your ear.One of the first things I did was put the headphones through a week's worth of my personal burn-in regiment.  This included playing a variety of songs (classical, jazz, r&b;, pop, broadway musical, etc.) for at least 10 hours a day for about a week at medium volume.  This typically ""breaks in"" the headphones for maximal performance.  I put about 100 hours before listening to these headphones.Having had the Jawbone SPORT and the Plantronics Backbeat, and being somewhat underwhelmed by these bluetooth headphones, I was prepared to be disappointed.  I will say that these Motorola SF600 outperformed these other two sets.  It produced a more significant bass response (when the headphones were seated properly), and the highs were more crisp.  However, I will not go so far as to say the sound is EXCELLENT, but it is one of the best sounding bluetooth headphones I have used thus far.  The start-up and shut-down audio prompts give a very good example of the potential by these headsets, but the actual audio that comes through is probably somewhere around 50% of its potential (generally speaking, of course).  I tried to play various audio to simulate the enhanced bass response (R&B;, Hip-Hop, Rap, etc.) and I just cannot get the same bass as the start-up and shut-down.  If you've heard these audio prompts, you will know what I am talking about.  The mids and highs are acceptable, but also can be a lot better.  So somewhat underwhelmed by these, and is the major reason for the 4-star rating.One major advantage is the lack of the wires, which is a major source of noise or interference.  Runners know this all too well, when the sound of the wires transfer to the earbuds.  This is similar to how voice vibrations transfer from a paper/plastic cup along a string.  With the SF600, your favorite workout tracks are streamed from your mp3 player (such as the MOTOACTV) so that you can keep moving without getting tangled up in wires.Also, this set boasts to be ""protected"" from moisture and sweat.  The headset sports a hydrophobic mesh and lightweight durable materials, including Kevlar and silicone seals deliver strength and protection from moisture.The battery life is very good.  I can go a day and a half of normal usage before the battery drains on me, and this includes listening to about 3-4 hours of music, watching 2-3 hours of movies and videos, and talking on the phone 2-3 hours a day.  My iPhone monitors the battery level, and when the unit is turned on it gives an audio prompt telling the battery level is high, medium, or low.These Motorola SF600 headphones allow you to answer calls as well as text messages (using Siri) whether you're on the trail or on the treadmill.  In addition to working with MOTOACTV GPS Fitness tracker and music player, the wireless Motorola SF600 headphones are compatible with most mobile phones, music players and tablets from Motorola and all leading manufacturers.  It has a built-in mic and controls make it easy to manage your calls and music. The answer/end call button (to control the phone) doubles as the play/pause button for the mp3 player.  UPDATE:  Siri can ""read"" NEW text messages received through the headphones (but it cannot read old messages), and you can ""reply"" to the text message through Siri by speaking the text through the headphones.  When you receive a text message, press the control button to activate Siri and say ""Read text message"" and Siri will ""read"" to you.  After, you can either have Siri ""read again"" or ""reply"" back to sender.One thing to note is that if you are listening to music (or watching a video) and you receive a call, and you want to use the Motorola SF600 as a bluetooth headset to answer the call, make sure you press the button on the headset (the top button on right earbud) and not the ""answer"" button on your phone.  For example, when I receive a call on my iPhone 4S and I press the ""answer"" button on the iphone, the audio will route to the handset and not the headset.  Not too big of a deal, I just have to transfer the audio to the headset using the controls on the iPhone (it will take a few seconds).  This is the cause of confusion for many users.Overall, it is a very good set of wireless bluetooth headphones.  I like the convenience of the wireless feature.  I would give it a 4.5 star rating (out of 5) for a bluetooth headphone set, and an average 4 out of 5 for a headset.  I would rank it as one of the best wireless bluetooth headphones (the best ones in my collection).  In terms of sound quality and compared to all of my headphones, I would rank it somewhere in the ""average"" range, and for the price you pay for the convenience of wireless and the very good battery life.  It is not the best set of headphones, but it is one of the best wireless headphones at its pricepoint, currently about $129 at Amazon.comWould I buy these for $129?  If you are looking for convenience of wireless bluetooth, these SF600 are the way to go.  If you are looking for sound quality for the same price and don't mind the wires, I would recommend the Ultimate Ears 600vi.  Also recommended is the Klipsch S4/S4i which have better sound quality than the SF600 but at a lower price (sub $100).UPDATE:  The headphones give an audible tone (same tone as phone's sound) when a text message or email is received.  You can have Siri ""read"" your text message by pressing the control button to activate Siri and say ""read text message.""  You can then either ""read again"" or ""reply"" to the sender.  It's a really cool feature I am appreciating more and more.  Also, a text message can be sent through the SF600 with Siri (on the iPhone 4S).  Press the home button on the iPhone (or the control button on the headset) to wake Siri, say ""Send text message to [NAME]"" and then you will be prompted to say the message to be sent.

B006B9GRM4,A1EYJGSBOKDSB,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","I purchased the Motorola SF600 from Verizon Wireless in December 2012.  By March 2013 (3 months later) the battery in the device would no longer accept a charge so I returned them to Verizon for a new pair.  The manager at Verizon looked under the battery cover and saw white residue and accused me of getting them wet.  I assured him the only moisture to get on this unit was copious amounts of sweat.  I only bought these to use while running.  Anyway, he exchanged them for a new pair.  Between March 2013 and July 2013, I went through three more pairs, essentially clearing out our local Verizon stores inventory.  All but one exchange was due to the device's inability to accept a charge to the battery and all three were because of sweat somehow seeping up into the usb port on the headset, corroding the contacts preventing charging.  THe fourth bad unit had a separate issue where it would not turn off, so it was always dead when I went to use it.  It also malfunctioned regularly in addition to not turning off.So now the Verizon store has nothing left for me to swap out to and they will not refund the $105 I paid for the unit.  So I'm stuck with a broken headset that I exchanged 4 times in 6 months.

B006B9GRM4,AIFLY2HF8NS8U,Andre Lawrence,"[46, 57]","...and, add the one-piece Bluetooth receiver to that list.*** The Benefits of a wireless, stereo Bluetooth headset ***Devices like this, (wireless) stereo sport headsets, are rapidly adding all of the conveniences of wired earphones such as:* high-fidelity speakers with in a compact design.* the ability to plug into portable mp3, mp4 and smartphones* relatively inexpensive- various price points.Combined with the functions of the one-piece Bluetooth headset:* the ability to receive and respond to incoming calls* wireless/ radio-frequency connectivity* long battery life.The drawback has always been, you needed both kinds if you want to:* listen to music in stereo* hassle of wires* the expense of buying two devices.Motorola Sports Headphone is one of the better wireless headsets I own.  It's marketed as having HD speaker system.  It's difficult to prove that it's actually ""High Definition"" but the dynamic range is incredible.  Listening to streaming audio up to 256 kbps and mp3 at 320 was a pleasure.The power of this device is its drivers and its built in amplifier.  So, if the music source is of lower quality, there's no way that the device will produce a HD sound, it can receive and replicate what is transmitted.  The good news is Bluetooth paired devices like a laptop or a smartphone usually has a built-in equalizer.For Android phones, like the Evo 3D I own, there are several very good free equalizers that you can download from the Marketplace.  When engaged, the beauty of the headset is unmistakable.Tracks like:Hayley Westenra's, ""You Are Water""The Royal Airforce Band (UK)/ Glenn Miller, ""In The Mood""Alexander O'Neal, ""If You Were Here Tonight"" - Jazzy remix (on YouTube)Or watching the documentary, ""The Flute Player""--it was almost like being in a theater.*** Battery Life ***The battery life was consistently between 5- 5.5 hours these past couple of weeks.  This was one of the things I most concerned with.*** Comfort ***They fit snugly.  That's the way I like it.  I have a Bose wireless and I'm always concerned when walking outside with them because there's nothing to keep them attached to the ear.  And, unlike the Jabra Sport, I didn't have to get used to them.*** Comparing Motorola to Jabra's Sport ***The Jabra ""Sport"" is the other stereo, Bluetooth headset that I have and it, too, is marketed for active users.---Fit & Design---*  Jabra- Slimmer design, slightly lighter, but arm-connector was a bit too long. Took a few days to get accustomed to the feel.  Yellow w/ black trim, sports theme.* Moto--Considerably larger, wrap-around ear makes for a snug, comfortable fit.  Black w/ chrome trim.  (Conservative design makes it suitable for many functions)---Button/ Accessibility---Jabra--Simple, large buttons.  Easy to navigate, easily accessible while wearing.Moto--Many buttons spread across both r/l speakers.  The on/off button very small and difficult to find.--- Sound/ Call Quality---Jabra--Very good.  Easily as good as moderate price, earphones.  Call reception very good.Moto--Exceptional.  Sound is between moderate and high-end headphones.  The combination of the built-in amplifier along with the source's equalizer settings makes sound reproduction explosive.---Battery Life/ Recharging---Jabra--4.5 hours/ 1:15 to fully rechargeMoto--5-5.5 hours/ 1:05 for 80%, 1:20 for 100%---Price---Jabra--between $70- 90 (Amazon's fluctuating price)Moto-- $130.*** Conclusion ***As I mentioned, these kinds of headsets will, within 3 years, start to fully replaced the wired headsets that have become the mainstay of people with portable music players and smartphones.  Gone will be the days when a snag wire means that you're shelling out $50- 75 for good quality, wired earphone.  These wireless, stereo Bluetooth does it all and considering the price of around $100, you're actually buying an upper midrange headset for the price but without the worries of a wired connection.If you're in the market for a single-ear Bluetooth receiver, I'd say consider buying one of these stereo Bluetooth receivers.  For the price of a decent single-ear, you have all of the features except a 5 hours battery life as oppose to about 8.5 hours with a single-ear piece.  But, these can also double as a theater headphone that you can use as far away as 30'.  Think about this when you're watch a long movie like The Lord Of The Rings trilogy.The real question is... is the more robust speaker system of the Motorola of such importance that you'd be willing to pay the $30 price difference instead of buying the Jabra Sport, which is nothing to sneeze at either?One last thing.  I am not an exercise junkie.  In fact, with the exception of basic yoga and pilates, my strenuous exercise regiment is far in my past.  My knees won't hold up under any kind of gym workout.  But, these are marketed to the fitness junkie.  So, my advice aside, you might want to consider the objective advice of the fitness writers who have some thought to add about how it works in a gym-setting if you plan you use these in a gym.For my purposes, Motorola Wireless Bluetooth Headset # SF600---- 5 stars.",5.0,1328227200,"02 3, 2012",Motorola SF600 Wireless Sports Headphones - Retail Packaging - Black,82.55,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31lhA%2B5vifL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 26060},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"

B006B9GRM4,AVPNQUVZWMDSX,"esanta ""esanta""","[2, 3]","The SF600 are bluetooth headphones designed to fit in the MOTOACTV fitness product line, but of course you can use them with any bluetooth device capable of handling the A2DP profile; I used these with my MOTOACTV and also my iPhone.The box contains the headphones, a very small 110/240V charger, a soft carry pouch and an assortment of five sizes of eartips.The headphones are made of two identical ear pieces (somewhat similar to a mono bluetooth headset) connected by a short semi-rigid wire that goes behind your head when you wear them.The eartips are adjustable in direction only, not height; and the part that fits behind the ear is thin. After a few tries I was able to put them on without problems, and they stay in place perfectly while jogging.The left piece features the power on/off button; everything else is on the right piece: microUSB connector (behind a rubber cover,) action button, and volume +/- buttons. There is a small indicator light next to the connector that gives you the status of the headphones (charging, pairing, connected, etc...) but it's placed in such a way that you don't see it unless you're looking straight at it, so it doesn't make you look like a Borg.Motorola seems to have paid particular attention to the controls on this unit, gearing them towards the use by fitness enthusiasts. Most other bluetooth headsets have separate controls for previous/next track, play/pause, and phone action; this results in a headset that is difficult to use while jogging. The three buttons on the SF600 are much simpler to use and provide most of the functionality of the more cumbersome design via the clever use of the multi-function button (at the top of the right unit):- one press to play/pause, or pick up a call if the phone is ringing, or hang up if a call is in progress- two presses to skip to the next track- three presses to skip to the previous track- long press for the power song (MOTOACTV only)A great feature on this unit is the voice menus and feedback. When you first turn it on, a female voice instructs you to pair the headphones with your device, and gives you the battery level. You can change the settings (voice feedback, high quality audio, caller ID) by pressing the power button and the action button simultaneously. If you're listening to music and a call comes in, you will hear ""call from 2125551212"" and you can press the action button to pick up the call (or a long press to reject). This is a really neat feature.Another great feature is the battery status display on compatible devices like the iPhone.The audio quality is spectacular. I think these are some of the best bluetooth headphones I've ever heard.To test the battery life, I fully charged them and then proceeded to listen to them continuously at medium volume. After seven hours, the battery was down to 1/3rd capacity.Pretty much the only sore point with these headphones is the microphone. I tested them while jogging, and my caller couldn't hear me. I then stopped to see if things would improve; I was standing on the sidewalk on a suburban street late in the evening, light traffic, no wind, and my caller still had trouble hearing me. So, lots of room for improvement here.THE GOOD--------* AMAZING sound quality* Very long battery life* Standard microUSB charger* Simple, intuitive controls* Sports-compatible (won't get ruined by sweat or constantly fall off your ears)* Voice prompts, including caller IDTHE BAD-------* Inadequate microphone* Design may not fit all ears, heads and hairstylesCONCLUSION----------If calling is not a major feature for you, the SF600 is perfect. If you regularly take calls while jogging or in noisy environments, and calling is a critical feature, there are better choices -- unfortunately, none of them with the spectacular sound quality of the SF600.",5.0,1327536000,"01 26, 2012",Motorola SF600 Wireless Sports Headphones - Retail Packaging - Black,82.55,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31lhA%2B5vifL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 26060},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"

Disappointing, but this seems to be the norm with many of these Bluetooth products. Still good at the gym where unit is on holder on equipment.  when  it is in your pocket you can expect dropouts.  If I had this to do over I'd buy another brand just to roll the dice to see if another one was better.7-18-2013:  EDIT.  Used second day on treadmill. Can't reiterate enough how difficult it is to use the buttons. They are very stiff and don't have a clicky feeling that lets you know you pressed them. Further, the action is delay by a moment after a successful press so you don't know if you successfully pressed or need to try again.  Looking back I wish I had tried something different, but I have these now and the sound is good, and they have not broke (yet) so I'll keep them (for now).  Wish there was one clear winner in the bluetooth headphone wars.  At this point I'd gladly pay $100 for the perfect set that would be bullet proof and feature rich.  I'm already missing the simple to use phone features of the 903 and its positive click buttons.7-17-2013:  Recently had, and returned, the Plantronics 903+ headphones as the music would cut out while my phone was in my pocket.  Just used these once and they do not have the same issue.  Sound is better. 903's were difficult to get on and adjusted, but so are these. Maybe more difficult, but once on they have stayed in place during mild activity. Buttons do not respond easily to touch - it's hard to know if you are pressing them. You have to squeeze the unit by putting your finger on the button, then a finger on the other side of the unit and squeeze to get the button to work.  Will try them at the gym this week and see how that goes.After reading many reviews for many different bluetooth headphones, it seems the technology is not perfected, that many units have problems with recemption, fit, sound quality, and sweat.  So perhaps I'll put up with bad buttons to get sound that does not drop, and a unit that does not fail after a month of use.",2.0,1374019200,"07 17, 2013",Motorola SF600 Wireless Sports Headphones - Retail Packaging - Black,82.55,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31lhA%2B5vifL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 26060},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"

B006B9GRM4,A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ,"Grimmy ""Grimmy""","[1, 2]","Pros:This set has better noise isolation than Jabra Sport. With several different ear gel sizes included, there should be one that fits your ears well enough. In a noisy environment, such as a gym, you won't have to blast up the volume as you would have to with the Sport. It won't shut out everything, but it's much better than the Jabra in this regard.Note, though, that the lowest volume when using it for phone calls with the iPhone 4 is still pretty loud. Not sure whose fault that is.Good sound across all ranges, with decent bass. Tried it with iPhone, iPad. Unfortunately with Garageband you can't do recording in real time, due to the Bluetooth lag, but playback is fine.Seems sufficiently workout-proof. The hydrophobic mesh seems to be holding out. We'll see ...Pairing is easy - it prompts for pairing each time it's powered on. Voice prompts for pairing, power on/off, etc.Mic for phone calls and voice control (if your phone has it); pretty good voice quality.Cons:The Power button is kind of a strange little nub. To press it, you'll have to get leverage against the other side of the battery thingy that goes behind your ear.The battery, etc. thingy that goes behind your ear is largish, and the connecting wire is kind of stiff and (when worn with eyeglasses, at least) seems to be a factor in making the earbuds less secure. I think it rubs on the neck or collar and slowly unseats the earbuds.The stem near where the eargels go into your ear are kind of big, so it's hard to get them into your ear further to block more sound.The case is a weird, flat thing with a strip of velcro in the middle, so it's kind of open on the sides.Misc:Battery life is 6 hours or more, depending on usage and volume.Uses multi-function button - one press for play/pause/answer call, two for next track, three for previous track, etc. Whether this is a pro or con depends on how much you want separate controls for these. Due to the size of these things, the multi-function button seems like a good tradeoff.UPDATE: After using these for a while, my chief complaint is the rather large earbuds, which cause my ear canal to ache after a bit. Another thing is the tendency of the cord to unseat the earbuds.

B006B9GRM4,A22S7D0LP8GRDH,"Jacob Hantla ""hantla.com""","[0, 1]","I love the Motorola SF600 Wireless bluetooth headphones! They are the most comfortable fit of any bluetooth headphones that I have tried. They come with multiple sizes of earbud inserts so that you can get a good fit. They stayed in place in my ears despite movement, very well, which is something that I have had trouble with some other brands and previous models of Motorola bluetooth headphones. The sound is very good and I had no reception problems no matter where on my body I placed my phone (many other bluetooth headphones don't do well if the signal has to cross your body). Battery life has been decent at about 4 hours of constant music or talking use.Now my disappointments:-People listening to me talk on these say that it sounds like I'm ""very distant"" or ""in a box"". It seems like all bluetooth stereo headphone makers don't focus much on the quality the microphone. I do not know of a better stereo headphone in this category, but am disappointed again.-The battery is weird. Perhaps this is a problem with just my unit, but one more than one occassion I will charge the unit and get an indicator showing that it is connected only to have it be dead in the morning. Or I charge it for a few hours and get just a few minutes of use out of it. Then other times I'll get hours of use out of it.

B006B9GRM4,A1P0JSFW184ZXJ,"Jen ""Geek Girl""","[1, 2]","I have tried numerous bluetooth headsets in the last year or so, and they all have their pros and cons. Some don't fit well, some have poor sound and some are poor quality. I have been desperately wanting a secure pair of sweat proof wireless earbuds that I can wear while cycling and during workouts and I think I may have found the perfect set for me.The fit of the SF600 on my smaller than average ears is perfect. I don't feel like they're going to fall off. I can jump and run, and short of headbanging to some Maiden (hey, I had to try!), these babies will not budge. They are very light and after a fairly short period of initial use, I neglect to even notice them. Part of this is thanks to the genius who said ""Let's put a soft covering over the cord!"" (Thank you, genius) because without this, other earbuds have a tendency to pull themselves out of my ears when the rubbery cord grips the back of my neck during a workout. Not a problem with the SF600. Yay! Another factor is the multiple sizes of ear gels. Make sure you try them all and find the one that fits you best. You don't want it popping itself out every 5 minutes because it's too big and you don't want it falling out constantly because it's too small. No one should have any issue finding the one of the 6 sets that fits them perfectly.Next is the battery. I used this headset for almost a week for about 2-3 hours per day before I finally had to recharge. This seems about standard for this type of wireless headset but is nice nonetheless.Sound is pretty good as well. It's not show stopping, but we're still fairly new into this era of wireless bluetooth earbuds and considering the competition, it performs just as well as I'd expect. Music is clear and full, audio from videos is crisp and clean. No complaints here. It's also very easy to access the volume rocker. Some earbuds like to cram a billion buttons into a small space on these earbuds so that your fingers are confused about which button does what, but the volume rocker is all on it's own on the back of the right ear piece and can't be confused with any other buttons.The multi function button rests on the top of the right ear piece, so it's impossible to push the wrong button. And speaking of the multi function button, a single touch answers an incoming call after the headset announces who is calling. Nice! This isn't a first, but it's not a feature in most headsets so it's welcome indeed. One less distraction while working out is a good thing in my book. The multi function button controls all aspects of audio playback - forward, back, pause, play. Also nice. I have an older Motorola bluetooth headset that was great for it's price range but was littered with buttons and I finally gave up on it after the 10th time I accidentally called someone when I was trying to pause my music. Less is more in this case. There's only one button on the left side, and that's the power button which you probably won't even need to mess with because you can turn it on before you put the earbuds on and vice versa when you take them off. The power button is kind of tricky to push when they're being worn, but it seems that's by design. If you want to turn them off, that likely means you're done using them.All in all, I'm very pleased and so far (after several months of use) they have held true to their claim of being sweat resistant. They are still performing well and I think they are a strong contender in the wireless earbud market.",5.0,1334707200,"04 18, 2012",Motorola SF600 Wireless Sports Headphones - Retail Packaging - Black,82.55,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31lhA%2B5vifL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 26060},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"
B006B9GRM4,A16P052K67T1GR,J. Hui,"[4, 5]","I picked up a ""new in box"" pair the about a week ago here on Amazon for 29.99. Not sure if it was a Goldbox sale or what but I happened to click on them while searching for a good pair of bluetooth earbuds to use at the gym.Amazon sent me a pair that weren't in a retail box and were missing all the accessories except the charger and the buds that were attached to the headphones themselves, they could be refurb or returns... I'm really not sure what the deal was but they offered to send sending me a new pair and while I wait for the new ones to arrive I am taking these on a test run to see how I like it... and holy wow I'm really loving them so far. It's been about 5 days since I got them (I also picked up a pair of Jaybird Bluebud X headphones from Best Buy last weekend and right now I'm deciding between the two pairs) and they are currently favored over my Bluebud X's first in price. The Bluebuds cost me $164 (though I used $160 of Reward Zone credit I had saved up) and though the clarity on them is a tiny bit better I feel that the SF600's are a way better pair of headphones for me.I'll quit with the comparison and try to stick to a straight review from here on out.Sound: I've had many a headphones being quite the headphone junkie and a audiophile on the cheap. These are on par with a good pair of Sony earbuds about the 80 dollar range ones. The bass is solid for ear buds, a tiny bit muddy in the mids compared to some of my top headphones but those lack in bass and I feel it's an acceptable trade off especially in the case of going wire free with these! The treble is clean and and altogether it makes my music very pleasant. Also it's not really noted or pushed but these are Apt-X bluetooth headphones which means they have a higher quality sound than BT headphones of yore... and it shows! These might be the most fairly priced Apt-X BT headphones available as of this writing! To note you do need a device that uses Apt-X compression (I used my Mac Mini) but honestly the quality from my iPhone/iPod Touch sounded great too. It's not like the older compression format that leaves a jingly high-hat sound in the treble from BT devices pre 2009. Overall unless you've got super hearing (mine is just above average) you wouldn't listen to mp3/compressed music to begin with.Comfort and Fit: It took a few minutes to figure out how to put these on... at least for me. I first tried to wrap them around my ear before pushing the bud in my ear canal. It's not really necessary actually. You can just push them in and the rest of it kind of wraps around your ears by themselves. Once their in they are quite comfortable, well as comfortable as any silicone ear tips get. Which for me is only good for about 45 min. I've ordered the Comply TX500s to put on. I won't know how they fair until next week unfortunately. But based solely on my usage over time it'll feel MUCH better on my ears. That said the included ear tips are a bit thinner and softer than ones I have used so they insert a little more comfortably but still do become uncomfortable after a some time. they also tend to slip out a little when I sweat. (Quick comparison I like the feel of these buds over the Bluebuds the bigger more solid wrap around piece that goes over your ear gives it more of a secure feeling like it won't ever move. I'll reevaluate after I get the Comply tips. The are the same ones for both sets of headphones)Battery Life: On my iPhone/iPod Touch the battery life is indicated on the screen, I never knew that it could do that, pretty nice feature! I went about 3 days at roughly 2 hrs a day on and off using the SF600 before the battery died completely. Once the battery hits ""low"" the voice prompt informs you that the ""battery is low"" and then procedes to beep once every 30 seconds. A bit annoying, but once you hit ""low"" you only have about 20 minutes before your headphones die completely anyway, so you'd probably want to stop using them at that point. All in all I got around 6 hours over the 3 days I used it.Value: At 30 bucks it's a heck of a deal. It's back up to $50 now I think which is still quite cheap compared to the alternatives... BUT I've read more than a handful of reviews stating that the one ear goes out from getting too wet or the thing dies completely in well under a year (I think it's been an average of 3-4 months) and I won't be able to find this out until after my return window has closed. This makes me a littler nervous because I actually love these headphones, even with the silicone tips. But if they die in 3 months then they're a waste of everyone's time. But then again I also don't know the circumstance of these other people and this may never happen to me at all. If these last me 2-3 years then there is no doubt that it's money well spent.Overall: If you've ever used canal headphones and hate them these are obviously not for you. But I would be hard pressed find a $30-$50 pair of bluetooth headphones that hold this kind of quality, style and comfort. Sound quality is top notch and I did not ever make a call using these headphones because honestly I've never had a pair of BT headphones that sounded even ""good"" to the people I talked to. I did record a little clip in quicktime and I sounded far away and harder to understand than when someone is talking directly to me in the phone.I can't say these are perfect for everyone but I'm definitely loving these headphones over anything else I've tested on the market so long as they don't crap out on me in the next 6 months.EDIT: Got my Comply tips in and they make a world of difference. What I've noticed about these buds is if they are jammed really tight into your ears the left earbud seems ""louder"" or more or less muffled. With the Comply TS500 comfort tips I got a decent seal without jamming the earbud too deep into my ear. The bass level increases a bit so not having them jammed in as tight is actually quite nice for sound quality. It's still a bit muddy compared to my Bluebuds X headphones but again at over 1/5 the cost these are a much better value at the end of the day. So long of course they don't die on me.",4.0,1366416000,"04 20, 2013",Motorola SF600 Wireless Sports Headphones - Retail Packaging - Black,82.55,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31lhA%2B5vifL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 26060},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"

I tried a bunch of ear gels and got a pretty good fit.  The literature says that the gels with the slots cut out are if you want to hear more ambient noise.  I tested the speaker connections to make sure that the initial problem did not repeat and they were firmly connected.UPDATE: January 28th, 2012I used them for a lift routine and I was able to walk 20 feet away from my iPhone, while searching for the right barbell and there was no static, or connection problems.For 1 hour, I was surprised how little my battery drained. I was running the fitness builder iPhone app (interacting with the screen), listening to an audiobook (Lord of the Flies), and using the bluetooth.  My iPhone went from an 85% charge to a 79% charge (according to the Boost Magic iPhone app).Normally, I use Etymotics which really block out ambient noise.  With the Motorola's I could hear every breath of the guy next to me.  These Motorola headphones only minimally reduce external noise.There is a real benefit to being completely wireless.  I have also used the Jabra Clipper, that allows you to use your own headphones, but then you still need to deal with the wire.  The benefit of the Jabra Clipper is that you can run with headphones you know work for you.For me, the Motorola sport headphones do not work for running.  I even am a forefoot runner and I hardly go up and down at all, but even so, the bluetooth receiver is kinda heavy and it bounced causing the gel to squeak with each step.In Conclusion:1 Star for Quality Control (1 in 100 headsets are tested)5 Stars for Customer Service (a free water bottle and two replacement headsets!)4 Stars for the actual product (easy pairing, good battery, good range, easy buttons, but not usable for running)",4.0,1327363200,"01 24, 2012",Motorola SF600 Wireless Sports Headphones - Retail Packaging - Black,82.55,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31lhA%2B5vifL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 26060},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"
B006B9GRM4,ACHTDPEQYSEQL,mhnstr,"[1, 2]","The Motorola SF600 Wireless Sports Headphones are comprised of two headphone bodies connected by a stiff, thin cable which runs behind your head.  The headphones connect to your player using a Bluetooth connection so that you dont have a cord running from the headphones to your player.  The absence of the long cord to your player makes the headphones very convenient to use since you dont have a cable swinging around you as you run.The Motorola headphones have a rectangular body which sits behind your ears.  The earbuds extend from the rectangular body and the earbuds can be swiveled to ensure a good fit into your ear canal.  Five different ear cushions are included with the headphones to ensure a comfortable fit.I have been using the Motorola headphones for several weeks while running and have been very pleased with them.  The sound quality is excellent and they have an amazing range which means that I never drop the Bluetooth connection.  I have not had any problems with sweat causing damage to the headphone components.Pairing the headphones with my laptop, phone and iPod was straightforward and easy to perform.These are not my first pair of Bluetooth headphones.  I also have a pair ofJabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Black/Yellowand so I will be comparing them to the Motorola version.* At first glance, I was concerned by the large size of the headphones because I thought that they would be uncomfortable.  The Motorola has its boxy, thin body which sits in contact with your head behind your ears.  Although this turned out not to be  uncomfortable, I was definitively aware that the headphones were there at first.  But, now after wearing them for some time, I dont really notice them anymore.  Alternatively, the  Jabra headphones are thicker than the Motorola, but they sit behind your ear (think one of the older style hearing aids).  With the Jabra headphones in place, I barely notice them.  In my opinion, the Jabra have an advantage for comfort while wearing them.* The Jabra earbuds are positioned right outside of the ear canal whereas the Motorla earbuds are inserted into the ear canal.  I actually prefer the Jabra approach because I can clearly hear the traffic around me.  Although you can choose to use a slotted ear cushions with the Motrola earbuds which is supposed to let in more traffic noise, I found myself feeling less aware of my surroundings.  While this may be the point for some people who would rather just hear music, drivers where I live pay little attention to runners or pedestrians crossing the street and so it is extremely important that I can both hear and see the cars around me.  In my opinion, the fit of the Jabra has the advantage.* A very big advantage for the Motorola headphones is the short cord between the headphones.  When the headphones are in place, the rigid cord is suspended behind your head without making contact with your skin.  The Jabra headphones on the other hand, have a long, flat cord (think linguini shape) that lies on your neck.  When you sweat, the cord of the Jabra headphones sticks to your skin resulting in the cord tugging at your neck whenever you turn your head which is very annoying.  The Motorola headphones have a clear advantage over the Jabra headphones in this regard.* The Motorola headphones definitely sound better than the Jabra headphones.  The music with the Motorola headphones is deeper and richer.  The Motorola definitely has an advantage in sound quality.* I found that the Motorola headphones never dropped the bluetooth connection to my player while I ran.  This was regardless of whether the player was on my shoulder, held in my right hand or held in my left hand.  The Jabra headphones have connection problems and even when held in my right hand (the side closest to the bluetooth receiver in the headset), the signal is dropped intermittently.  If you wear your player on your shoulder, this wont be an issue but for people like me who prefer to hold your player in your hand, the dependable connection of the Motorola headphones is a clear advantage.* The Motorola cable and headphones are black in color whereas the Jabra headphones are yellow.  While there are reasons to have flashy headphones, if you wish to be more nondescript, the Motorola headphones have an advantage.* Both the Motorola and the Jabra headphones have excellent call quality when using them for making calls.In summary, in terms of comfort while wearing and the positioning of the headphones, the Jabra is the better headset.  However, in every other regard, the Motorola headphones are better and I would recommend them over the Jabra headphones.I found the instructions that came with the Motorola headphones to be ok.  The font that they used for the at a glance instructions is ridiculously small (possibly 4 point).  I have not tried initiating calls with the headphones so I cant review how easy that is, but overall, I have found the headphones easy to use.Overall, I highly recommend the Motorola headphones.  The excellent sound quality, the positioning of the cord behind your head, the strong Bluetooth connection and the ease of use all give the Motorola headphones a clear advantage over other Bluetooth headphone options.",5.0,1345766400,"08 24, 2012",Motorola SF600 Wireless Sports Headphones - Retail Packaging - Black,82.55,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31lhA%2B5vifL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 26060},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"

B006B9GRM4,A4UGMKUSX9XHI,Robert Stone,"[1, 2]","I received this unit yesterday and have done some preliminary tests and it works well. Pairing with my iPhone 4 was easy and was coordinated by an auditory cue - as another reviewer noted you will like that cue if you like a British accent (which I do.) As I looked at the device, I thought that there is no way that it would stay in the ear since it appears there is so much weight in the back I thought it would ""torque"" out of the ear - but it does not. I just left the default gels in (they worked well for me) but it is nice they supply 5 sizes to improve the chances of a good fit. I actually examine multiple ears daily in my work and everyone's ear canal is different - almost like a fingerprint - so for some there is no doubt these would not work but I suspect the vast majority of people will be able to use them. I have not had any issues with moisture penetration but that might be a more long term issue and these have seen limited use thus far. Sound quality was good and I even walked away from my iPhone and did not start to get drops until I was about 15 feet away - which was a surprise (in a good way!)Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I'll post update with any issues.",5.0,1327536000,"01 26, 2012",Motorola SF600 Wireless Sports Headphones - Retail Packaging - Black,82.55,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31lhA%2B5vifL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 26060},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"
B006B9GRM4,A294SHLWPSG1BP,Ryan Winkleman,"[3, 5]","These is my first pair of wireless headphones, and frankly, I love the concept. It's nice to have no cords to worry about. However, there are several issues with the SF600 headphones that make them troublesome to wholeheartedly recommend. Let's look at the good and bad:The good:- Pair easily with Bluetooth devices. I was able to pair these headphones with both their intendedMOTOACTV 8 GB GPS Fitness Tracker and Music Playerunit and with my phone very easily. It tells you audibly over the headphones when you turn them on to press ""0000"" if prompted to when pairing, but I did not have to do that for either device. When using them after initial setup,  just turn on the MOTOACTV or other unit, turn on the headphones, and then tell it to pair with the headphones, and that's it. I can pretty easily switch from streaming music from my MOTOACTV over the SF600's to turning off the MOTOACTV and switching right over to streaming from my phone without any trouble. (and in case you're wondering, yes, you can have both your phone and these headphones Bluetooth paired to your MOTOACTV simultaneously to listen to music and get all your phone notifications at the same time)- They are fairly small. These look much bigger in the product photo. They are actually reasonably small and are partially obscured by your ears (see my user photo). You don't have to look like as big of a dork as the product photo makes it seem.- Higher ranges are pretty good. I mean...they're wireless headphones, but the higher treble stuff sounds pretty good.- Streaming quality is good. I get the occasional microsecond hiccup, but other than that these stream from your device fine. The manual says to try to keep the unit above your waist to avoid having any signal problems, but I keep both my phone and my MOTOACTV at my waist and have had no problems.- They are stylish. The black and red looks good and matches the MOTOACTV's style.- They come with a carrying case. The case is nothing special, just a small velcro case, but it's black and red like the headphones and stylish. It would be nice if it had a lanyard or something to make sure it doesn't accidentally get dropped or fall out of a pocket, but it'll do as-is.- They come with spare earbud covers. In addition to the ""solid"" covers that are on the earbuds already, you get two additional sizes each of ""solid"" and ""open"" earbud covers.- The on-unit buttons are useful, with the exception of the power button. There are volume buttons and a multifunction button (MFB) on the right-ear unit. These are pretty easy to get to while using the headphones, and of course you can just adjust volume on your phone or MOTOACTV if it's easier for you than reaching up and fumbling to try to find them on your ear. Similar to the ""music"" button on the MOTOACTV, the MFB will play/pause with one press, skip forward with two, and go back with three presses.The bad:- These are really hard to put on. It takes me like 30 seconds to put these on every time. Because of their bulk in the back and because the actual earbud part of them twists back and forth for adjustment, they are very awkward to fit over and stick in your ear. Once they're on you're good, but I struggle with this every time.- They get uncomfortable after a while. Because they're hanging over your ears, they suffer from that syndrome that these over-the-ear earbuds tend to have, which is that after a while they start hurting.- They feel a little loose when running. They're fine if walking or doing something that doesn't involve a lot of bouncing around, but while running they seem to feel a little loose. I don't feel like I'm going to have to reach up and grab them, but they just feel insecure...but I guess that's kind of an issue with any pair of earbuds while running.- The power button is terrible. It is a hard little button that doesn't push in or anything, so you just press it until they turn on. It's not a good design. Kind of hard to describe unless you see it yourself.- There is basically no bass to speak of. If you like bass, you won't like these. If you don't care about much bass, you will probably like these. The bass is waaaaaay low.- It's hard to know how much battery you have left. When it first pairs it gives you a message about the battery level (""battery level is high,"" or something like that), but after that you kind of have to play a guessing game.Miscellaneous:- The manual doesn't tell you what to look for, so when you're charging these, flashing red and solid orange mean they're charging, while green means charging is finished. These also come with their own charger (one single charging unit, not a separate USB cable).- If you like the sound of a woman with a British accent speaking to you, you'll be very pleased ;-)Overall these are decent wireless headphones, and if you use the MOTOACTV you'll like that they are designed to match the look and minimalism of the unit. However, it's up to you if you want to pay $130 for some headphones. I've done my best to outline the pros and cons above, hopefully you can make an educated purchasing decision now!

B006B9GRM4,A30X750M8V1XXW,Scott,"[0, 0]","I'm comparing these to the Jabra Sport which are way better in many ways in my opinion, which I'll explain. These are hard to get into and over your ears. The earbuds do twist but its difficult to do unless you use both hands to get then hooked over your ear while simultaneously twist the bud into your ear. The jabra'a are flexible and you can do it with one hand much easier.The SF600 have a smaller connecting wire which I like better than the Jabra. The reason is that when moving and twisting your neck the jabra's stick to your skin if your sweaty and the Motorola's do not. Pairing on both was super simple but the buttons on the SF600 don't feel like they click or depress at all. The power button is a small nub that I thought was a piece of plastic that wasn't filed down during manufacturing. Plus its on the left and the there buttons are on the right. I like that the Jabra has them all on one side.The sound quality is a bit crisper and louder on the SF's but there isn't much bass so they sound more tinny. The sound on the jabra's has better bass and I much prefer them. Battery life on the Jabra is about 2.5 hrs and the SF's is around 3 of continuous music. I do like that the recharge cord is long on the SF's whereas the Jabra its about 3 inches. I did notice that while the music is at one level, if a message comes in or an announcement from the internal female voice its double as loud and its not only startling but it hurts your ears. Jabra doesn't do that, it stays at the volume level you have. The SF's do go louder than the jabra though but that's not a good thing to have ear buds blasting.The SF's also come with a bunch of different rubber buds to customize your fit as well as let more ambient sound in or not. It also comes with a nice carrying pouch to keep things in.  In my opinion I'd rather have better sound so my preference is with the Jabra. I wish there was a way to have a few things from the SF and a few from the Jabra which would make them a near perfect set at least for me. The jabra's look more like Apple earbuds so there are no rubber buds to fit. Its also been my experience that the rubber buds that the SF have can get clogged up after time if you don't keep them clean.I overall feel that the Jabra's are easier to use and have a better bass sound and also are quick and easy to put on but battery life isn't great. I really wanted to love the SF's but for me, the design was more of a problem than the sound.",3.0,1327449600,"01 25, 2012",Motorola SF600 Wireless Sports Headphones - Retail Packaging - Black,82.55,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31lhA%2B5vifL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 26060},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"

In an indoor environment I've used them for over 4 hours without draining the battery. Outside, I get around 3-4 hours. This has been consistent for over a month.Fit - I am very happy with the fit and have no problem wearing them for hours. The headset comes with a variety of earbuds and I found a nice match. Additionally, the buds can be ""rotated"" left and right for an even better fit.Earbuds - One thing that I really like is the buds that allow outside sounds to come in. I can even wear these while riding my bike. At a low volume I can hear sounds around me but still know my environment. The downside to these particular earbuds is that you will lose some bass. If safety isn't important to you then you can still use the traditional earbuds and get a nice amount of bass.Instructions - Well written. No complaints.Pairing - Same as any other modern BT device. Push and hold the power button and tell you phone to look for it. Simple.Sweat - These are designed for working out and so far I have had zero issues with sweat. I mostly use them when I'm commuting my bicycle so they have seen their share of sweat. I'm pleased.Calls - Very good. People sound great on my end and nobody has complained about the sound quality on the other end. I have a very nice Jawbone headset that I use for most voice calls and people sometimes complain about hearing an echo of there own voice. No such complaints from the Motorola.Cons:Outside Usage - As with every other stereo BT headset that I've tried these still cut out when worn outside. They work beautifully inside and I can walk all over my condo with little to know degradation in sounds quality. I do realize that this is a common theme with this style of headset but until the quality matches the manufacturers' advertising I'm going to continue to ding them on this issue. Having said that, they work better than most outside and I can even keep my phone in my pocket and hear my music consistently.Buttons - The buttons are difficult to use. They require a lot of pressure to push which causes the headset to sometimes dislodge from my ears. I can somewhat compensate for this by creatively pushing my thumb on the other side of my ear but it's awkward. I must add though that the button *arrangement* is straightforward and makes sense.In Conclusion:By far the best BT stereo headset that I've tried. MUCH better than the Jabra models.

B006B9GRM4,A11I1I9QLMAM1A,S. Power,"[85, 90]","I have tried pretty much every brand and model of this type of headphones and these are easily the best.  I use them for running, skiing (under a Giro helmet), and under shooting earmuffs for work with power tools.  They work really well in every use case that I've thrown at them.Sound - The sound on these is great.  I wish that they could go a little louder, but they are just as loud as the other competing products from Motorola and Jabra.Comfort - From the picture on the website, I was leery about how comfortable these would be.  They appeared like they would be heavy, bulky, and uncomfortable.  This is definitely not the case.  Nothing hanging on your ears is going to be un-noticeable, but these come pretty close, especially when compared to the others I've tried.  I am using the large size ear cushion, they come with 5 different sizes to choose from.Battery - The battery life on these is great.  I haven't run them down in a single use yet.  I don't know how long the battery in them is supposed to last for, but they kept working for a full day of skiing, so anything beyond that is gravy.Connection - These connect easily with my Motorola Triumph Android Phone and with my Motorola MotoActiv Sport GPS.  They stay connected, and I wasn't able to make the connection drop out at all during normal use, inside or out, even with a ski helmet on.Durability - The first one of these I got was broken/defective out of the box.  The sound would only come out of the right ear.  I called the Motorola number in the manual and they sent me a replacement headset right away.  The call took about ten minutes with lots of miscommunications with the foreign based customer service representative.  They sent me a replacement and a shipping label to return the defective unit with.  The replacement set has worked very well so far.  It seems to be highly sweat and rain proof, and based on my experience with other Motorola headsets, I have little doubt that these will continue to perform well.  I will update this review if it doesn't continue to work well.Buttons - The buttons are well placed and easy to use.Accessories - the charger, travel pouch, and ear cushions are all good quality.  The manuals are concise and well written.Calls - This headset is great at making and receiving calls.  Both on my end and on the other end the call quality is exceptional.  I am always amazed at the quality of the calls with this latest generation of headsets, because they manage to have good call quality even though the microphone is so far from your mouth.Customer Service - When my first headset arrived with a defective left ear, I used it as an opportunity to try out Motorola's warranty support and Customer Service.  The 800 number in the manual went to a foreign based call center that was very difficult to communicate with.  The call took three times as long as it would have with a US based CSR and I left the call very unsure if I was ever going to see my replacement headset.  Despite my lack of satisfaction with the phone call, they quickly got me a replacement headset and also provided free return shipping for my defective unit.I highly recommend these headphones.  Motorola should consider US based phone support and better quality control at their manufacturing facility, but otherwise these are a great product.

Motorola claims this one has extra long range; perhaps in closer proximity this means stronger signal. Anyhow, I am happy on that front.Another thing that I love about this headset is how compact it folds when not in use. It is the smallest I have. When fully folded, it is off. The ear loop is also ambidextrous and easy to flip around for left or right ear, no need to snap it off first (like with other headsets I've had). It will fit in any tiny shirt or pant pocket or corner very unobtrusively.The headset is very easy to pair (although they are all getting much better these days). In addition, it tells you ""8 hours of talk time remaining"" and so on every time you turn it on. This is all good, but I noticed that without much talk it starts saying ""7 hours"" and then 6, so perhaps this battery indication is not the most reliable :)My only issue with this headset is that after prolonged use (just keeping it on my ear), my ear starts to itch.

Bluetooth has become essential to my life due to recent laws in the city and I rely on these for work and personal reasons.With that being said, I found the H19txt to have both great perks and some noticeable flaws. As of right now, it is my primary device, but that is more out of convenience than anything.Pairing is no big deal - like with every Bluetooth device, my iPhone 4S was ready in under 20 seconds. The battery life is as advertised: 8+ hours of talk time on each charge can be expected. The charging is easy and fast. The buttons are similar to previous Bluetooth models and perform admirably, even when pressed against your face.Sound quality is always an issue for me and I found it to be just OK. Rarely would it static up / red line and just turn into a mush. I would stream some music in as well, which sounded about as good as one can expect from such a miniature speaker. The mic works well too, with nary an issue in terms of being heard on the other side. The flip-out mic, operating as an on/off switch as well, is exceptionally fragile. I would recommend not messing with it too much and simply unpairing the device.Comfort is hit or miss. Without the plastic joint the headset will fall off with too many sudden movements. With it on it will hold in an acceptable fashion. The joint can also can feel a bit rough around the edges, which also hinders the comfort level. Once again, the flip-out mic and its fragility works against how you wear or use this headset.In terms of the Motorola line of Bluetooth headsets, I have found this one to be the most reliable one yet.",4.0,1357084800,"01 2, 2013",Motorola H19txt Universal Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging,39.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411NC-Td79L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 7994},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories', 'Computer Components']]"

Most of them are either Motorola, which are very good, Jabra, which are pretty good, Plantronics, also pretty good, and Blue Ant, which are terrible.Until the Motorola H19txt arrived, my favorite headset was the Motorola HX550, which is also very good and similar in appearance to the H19txt.But there's no question that the Motorola H19txt is my new favorite Bluetooth headset.  There are 3 reasons why I like this headset so much.  They are:1. Range.2. Battery life.3. Audio clarity.You might have noticed that the title of this review is ""A review from the toilet seat"".  What did I mean by that?  Let me explain.As much as we might not like to admit it, I think there are times where we might use the phone while on the John (no offense intended towards those named John).  I live in a pretty small place and my bathroom is the one and only room in the house where, up until now, conversations were so garbled as to be nearly inaudible.So as a test, I tried the Motorola H19txt in the bathroom.  Amazingly, it was the first headset I've used that was actually pretty clear even from the bathroom!  Was the signal perfect?  No, it wasn't, but it was pretty good and I'd say a 50%-70% improvement over all of my other Bluetooth headsets.  It's now my ""go to"" headset when I have to go or otherwise!I also mentioned battery life.  This unit features talk time of up to 9 hours.  When you turn it on, it says, ""More than 8 hours of talk time remaining"".  Battery life seems quite impressive.The audio quality is also very good and better than the Motorola HX550, although only marginally so.Pairing is very simple, so no complaints there.The form factor is very small and light.  It's also relatively comfortable to use with eyeglasses.  I've used a number of other headsets that were not comfortable when used with the ear loop and eyeglasses.I haven't used the text features.  Sounds pretty cool, but I'm not a big texter and besides, I don't believe my phone is compatible with the MotoSpeak application.  I'm sure others will address that feature.But hey, it's a really good Bluetooth headset. It delivers exactly what is promised.

It came in a small box that was easy to open (I wish more manufacturers would realize simple, easy, packaging is appreciated!).

All I did was go into my settings, opened ""Blue Tooth"" and (after turning on the headset), set it to discover the device - it did immediately and I didn't have to type in the security code (located in the instructions).

And I am saying this from the perspective of owning different brands of BT headset and comparing it to the Motorola H19txt.My impressions:Advanced features: The Motorola H19txt has a Rapid Connect feature where the mouth piece or boom of the BT headset can be folded to turn it off and unfold it to turn it on. This is great if you need to conserve your BT's power when not in use. With A2DP, you can stream music to your BT headset or listen to navigation commands from your GPS. Voice prompts lets you know when you are or are not connected to your phone. This headset also has the capability to connect to 2 devices at the same time. For iphone users, the Motorola H19txt also works with Siri. For Android users, the free app My Motospeak can be downloaded to give you a wide array of additional functions with the voice prompts.Shape Factor: The Motorola H19txt Universal Bluetooth Headset is compact, smaller than most major brand bluetooth headsets currently out in the market. If you have hair that covers your ears, this BT headset practically disappears from sight.Wearing Flexibility: The Motorola H19txt offers three wear styles for the perfect TrueComfort fit: On your ear, In-ear without a hook, and In-ear with a hook. The flexible ways of wearing this BT headset also translate to wearing comfortability. This BT headset is worn according to your own personal level of comfort fit and thus can be worn for hours without ever knowing it is in your ear. I found this expecially true during a stop over at a hotel during a long drive. I didn't realize I was still wearing the headset were it not time to lay down in bed. It also can be worn comfortably even when you wear glasses or a hat. Some hook style BT headsets will not fit around the contours of your ear with your glasses on. Since the Motorola H19txt can also be worn in ear without a hook, this solves this minor predicament.Audio: The Motorola H19txt boasts of an HD Audio Plus for exceptional clarity and a dual microphone technology that cancels background noise. My audio test-run from a moving vehicle proves the call quality. The person I am speaking to heard me clearly and I am able to hear them clearly.Power/Battery Life: The Motorola H19txt has a standby time of 16 days and a talk time of 9 hours. So for those of you out there who are contantly on your cell phones, this outstanding talk/standby times pretty much covers you.The Motorola H19txt comes in a sleek, hard plastic packaging. The packaging contains the BT headset, an on-ear hook, an in-ear hook, 2 in-ear gels, charger and the user guide. I really enjoyed using this BT headset.

Many are uncomfortable, obtrusively large, have short battery life or bad sound quality.  The Motorola H19txt series is a great example of a bluetooth headset done right.  It's extremely small and lightweight making it easy to wear for extended periods.  The small size and lack of LEDs also makes the headset relatively discrete.  The H19txt comes with a wide variety of ear clips and in-ear silicone plugs ensuring that you'll be able to get a good fit.  The battery easily manages eight hours of talk time, much longer on standby.  The folding boom design makes it simple to activate and deactivate the headset as well as provides a clear visual indication of whether the headset is on or not.  Opening the boom while talking on a call using the handset instantly shifts the call to the headset, a very useful feature.  The phone has numerous voice prompts that communicate the headset's status.  The ""txt"" in the name indicates that using Motorola's ""My Motospeak"" app, you can dictate texts through the headset.  Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, this headset sounds great.  The noise cancelling is truly excellent and the microphone is very sensitive.  You no longer have to shout in a car at highway speed for the other person to hear you if you're using this headset.  You'll also be able to hear them better.

He's tried many options over the years. So he was curious how the Motorola H19txt Universal Bluetooth Headset would hold up.First off, the small size is great. It fits right into your ear in multiple ways. There's an over-the-ear hook, which he finds too loose and it easily falls off when being active. Then there are in-ear rings. For him, one size is too small and easily falls out. The other size is a bit too big so it fits but the pressure hurts after a little while. So he'd like a middle size.The battery life is good - he gets a steady eight hours out of it. It's got a number of neat features. If you press the volume on and off at the same time during a call, it mutes, and tells you verbally that it's muted. Do it again and the mute turns off. If you do that when you're not on a call, it'll tell you talk time remaining. If you press and hold the call button while turning on the headset, you can change various options including the voice interface and caller ID.We highly recommend turning OFF the caller ID feature. With it on, you have to wait through an interminable computer voice reading out all ten digits of the phone call before you can answer it. You'll be lucky the person didn't hang up by the time you wait for that to finish.Compared with other phones we've tested, this one works much better at staying connected while calls come and go, and other activities like audio books stop and start again.He'd like it if it could let you listen with the little microphone piece tucked in.

I decided to give it another try after it kept going in and out losing connection in mid conversation after about a month of use rendering the headset worthless! I like the 8 hur talk time and when positioned correctly the clarity and being able to hear whom I am speaking to. I upgraded to this unit after my Motorola HX550 Headset just quit on me after 2 1/2 months ! Fortunately Motorola sent me a new one out. Sooo I upgraded to the H19txt and this one went on the blink after less than a month of use! I will keep you updated! Also I use my blutooth heavily as I am a manager at a Honda store and I despise holding a phone up to my ear all the time . I will up date you guys on weather this unit is for COMMERCIAL USE! The talk-time of 8 hours is GREAT but can it hold up?????Very easy to power up a does not take long to charge!!! 8 Hours talk time .

This particular headset is a very good product in that same line.1.  What's in the box?  I received a smaller box with the headset unfurled so to speak with the boom mike out.  Inside the box, there were instructions, a extra set of earpieces, and a charger included.2. Aesthetic?  This is a small unit.  Imagine something placed on your fore-thumb and that is about the size of the unit.  It is an appealing gunmetal grey color, with a silver boom mike and a raised surface on the front (visible) side, with a button in the middle to place calls, and a volume button on the top.3.  Use?  The first measure of this unit was the set-up.  After charging for an hour or so, I simply pulled out the boom mike and you will hear a sound telling you that you have battery power (up to 9 hours?!) and whether a connection has been made.  Using an iphone, I did not have to ""pair"" the device, but the item was discovered and announced it was ready to go.  Phenomenally easy! No entering in passcodes or anything similar.  High marks for this.I really love the idea that turning off this item is as easy as just closing the mike.  Nice.  Also, it seems as though I have been able to talk for hours without having to recharge.  In earlier incarnations, the headset would need a charge after a few hours.  I have yet to run this thing down from talking.  The standby time seems impressive as well.  I have been able to use this item for days without any issue.Sound?  After removing the plastic cover on the microphone, the sound is quite good.  Other parties have stated that the sound is good, but a bit tinny. However, the sound is good according to other people listening to us on the phone.Pros:  Easy set-up.  Nice, attractive looks.  Long battery life.Neutral:  This is a nice-looking unit.  Although there is the lower-priced unit available that is white, silver and read that looks really neat, this is a still nice looking, however.Cons:  None really.  I am satisfied with this headset.  Keeping in mind that I received to review, it is an expensive headset, currently being about 100ish.  In all honesty, I might purchase a lower end model.  However, this is still a very nice unit.",4.0,1348704000,"09 27, 2012",Motorola H19txt Universal Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging,39.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411NC-Td79L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 7994},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories', 'Computer Components']]"
B006C248BC,A141W8WHW9AC3H,"Nelly ""Vision Teacher""","[3, 3]","I generally like this Bluetooth, with a few caveats.  The sound quality on MY end is very good.  Unlike my last Bluetooth, people I talk to don't tell me that I sound like I am in a tunnel, far away, or other indicators of poor sound transmission on their end.This unit has the convenient flip on-and-off tab that I MUST have in a Bluetooth -- no wondering if you left it on, you can see if it is on or off.  Also, it is really hard to ""butt dial"" anyone on this style...something that used to happen a lot with the style of Bluetooth that turns on just by holding a button down for a couple of seconds.This unit pairs with my phone VERY quickly...VERY.  That is a huge help -- it will connect before I even have to answer by the third ring.Another nice feature is that it tells you upon connection how much battery life is left on the Bluetooth (i.e., ""over 7 hours left"").  This is helpful if you aren't talking on an iPhone (which shows you the battery level onscreen).The only drawback (and this is a big one for me) is the hard, non-adjustable ear loop.  It tends to irritate my ear because of its inflexibility, and also tends to fall off, since it cannot really be adjusted to fit your ear at all.  It does come with additional in-ear clear rubber buds, so it can be worn without the loop, but I find that the unit seems to fall out easily, either due to the design or the weight distribution.  The unit is not heavy, but it still will easily pull the bud out of your ear.Anyway, so overall a very nice quality Bluetooth, but if you have sensitive ears, the hard, inflexible ear loop may bother you.",4.0,1351036800,"10 24, 2012",Motorola H19txt Universal Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging,39.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411NC-Td79L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 7994},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories', 'Computer Components']]"

B006C248BC,A1YVO5V1SO18DZ,"The Bee Bee ""BB""","[22, 25]","The Motorola H19txt bluetooth headset offers so much potential to those of us who have tried headset after headset looking for THE ONE that finally works as advertised. Unfortunately, the Motorola H19txt falls a little short. That's expecially diappoointing given the premium price this model is going for. Where are the disconnects, so to speak? Mainly audio quality. Motorola says the H19txt has two features called HD Audio Plus and CrystalTalk that employ a dual-mic technology to increase call clarity and richer sound (whatever that means). In my testing, the sound quality was mostly average in comparison to other Bluetooth headsets I've used, and at times it was noticably worse. CrystalTalk is supposed to cancel out unwanted background noise, but on the model I tested noise gate had a nasty delay that caused an abrupt and unnatural-sounding clipped tone whenever somebody would speak. This undesirable ""sound effect"" started to get on my nerves, and no amount of fiddling with settings on their otherwise decent Android app helped very much. Otherwise, performance was about what you would expect from a bluetooth headset. The onboard controls are logical and easy to use, and the app does a nice job of freeing you from having to use any of those controls at all. Usable range was excellent, and the battery life is nothing short of amazing. Were it not for some troubling issues with the sound quality, I would have given Motorola H19txt a much higher rating.",3.0,1350518400,"10 18, 2012",Motorola H19txt Universal Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging,39.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411NC-Td79L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 7994},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories', 'Computer Components']]"

I rate them on the following:(1) Ease of setup(2) Comfort on my ear(3) Length of charge(4) Ease of phone appI'll give you my impressions how this headset measures up, I used this on my HTC One X.SETUP:On my smartphone, I went to the Bluetooth menu, and it recognized the headset and paired right away. No code entry was required, but depending on your phone, you might need to enter a pairing code (which is provided in the instructions). I then downloaded the ""My MotoSpeak"" app, which was very easy.When you flip the mouthpiece down, a voice will announce: ""Phone one connected. More than [x] hours of talk time.""COMFORT ON MY EAR:This is a very, VERY comfortable headset. The headset can be adjusted to fit either the left or the right ear with easy adjustment, There is no need to remove and reattach the hook.I've uploaded a few pictures to ""Customer Images"" for you to look at.It can pivot up or down to your comfort level, and it didn't feel heavy on my ear.LENGTH OF CHARGE:A full charge gives you 8 hours of talk time. I typically this headset for about 45 minutes to and from work,  and I have over 6 hours of my charge left.EASE OF PHONE APP:This is the big selling point for this headset, My MotoSpeak (Current version is 3.0.57).The app allows you to do hands-free sending and receiving of text messages. If you don't have the headset in, you can still have your phone read messages aloud, but sending messages is harder without the earpiece, unless you speak loudly. You can add an optional signature line to your messages, but I disabled this.If you get a text while driving, there's a blip on the earpiece and you'll hear:""Text from [person's name], Listen now?""You can say ""Yes"" or ""No"".If you say yes, the message will be read by a female voice. Once it ends, the voice will say ""Reply?"" And you can say the following: ""Yes"", ""No"", or ""Repeat"" to repeat the message.After speaking your message, it will read your reply back and then say ""Send the message?"" and you can say ""Yes"" or ""No"". If everything's fine, I pick ""Yes"" and the message is sent. If it didn't recognize what I was saying, I'll pick ""No"". It will then say ""Try Again?"" and you can either choose ""Yes"" (which allows you to rerecord your reply) or ""No"" (which closes the message).When you press the button on the headset, it will say ""Say a Command"". If you say ""Text [name]"", the phone will repeat the name you spoke and then say ""Opening Text message. Say your message"". At this point, you're ready to go.No voice recognition software is perfect, but this one is very accurate for me. Heck, it recognized the word ""gobbledygook"" - and any headset which can do that is top notch in my book.ANY DRAWBACKS?Well, it's mainly the app I have issues with. If I get a call and someone text messages me, the message will not be read to me when the call is over. It would be nice if a future version of this app has a menu option to listen to the most recent message.I also found this is not compatible with Google Voice on my phone, so I have to turn off the headset if I want to do updates for Twitter or Facebook.FINAL VERDICT?Overall, this is a very comfortable Bluetooth headset. It is easy to set up, comfortable, and holds its charge.

Flip it closed and you can save battery life- can pair with 2 phones at the same time- helpful voice prompts to let you know when you're connected, running low on battery, etc.Cons: I don't really have anything bad to say here - so far it's been a pleasure to use.

It's not the best ever, but it's on the upper echelon.Opening it is straight forward.  One of those new hard plastic tops and you slide it out.  As with new headsets you can wear it just in the ear or just over the ear or both (which I do...both).  During the day you move around and with just one (ear or over ear) it can fall off easily.  With both I've never had it fall off.Pairing it is easy.  I have a Droid 4. Perhaps that's due to both being Motorola, but I had no problems.I can hear people great.  However I'm taking one star away due to people saying my sound quality is not crystal clear.

Does not come charged. Included Micro USB and AC adapter charger.NOTE it's most likely you will need a extension cord.  Unless you have a setup of some sort as the cord is not long to charge it.Wearing it causes no problems.

B006C248BC,A108XABRHAA9E7,YSC,"[2, 2]","Likes:- Voice guidance is a great feature that takes the guess work out of its status. It even reports battery level with estimated talk time remaining.- The flip-open mic seemed redundant at first, but it did work more reassuringly than a tiny physical switch. The ""Rapid Connect(TM)"" instant-on feature is great in that you just flip open the mic at the incoming call, and it's connected and working immediately from sleep. It saves battery without hassle of waiting for re-connection.- Long battery life: there must be more tricks than large battery size to save battery here. Standby time is over a week with average daily talk-time of an hour. It's pretty amazing given the small physical size.- Long range. Motorola claims 300ft range, which is probably at its best conditions. Yet in my own testing, it held connections easily for over 20 meters or 65ft unobstructed in an office space. I imagine that should be good enough for most needs.- Pairing with phones have been pain-free. No need for passwords. Have not been able to test NFC pairing.Dislikes:-Sound quality is average for a bluetooth handsfree. Interestingly, in testing it seemed to give out different audio quality from different phones, suggesting possible proprietary DSP support. To me it worked best with an Moto Atrix tested. With an iPhone 4s and an old LG Optimus T, both simply didn't sound as good, with LG's not as loud as the iPhone. I do not have conclusive evidence, but if you have a Motorola phone, your experience is likely to be better than others.Other notes:-Supports MicroUSB, so you can charge with most android phone charging cable and adapter, and vice-versa with the included charger+cable-supports on-ear and in-ear options with gel plugs.

This was NOT the case with Motorola docking stations for the original Droid. I am glad Motorola learned from prior experience!I was also concerned with the phone docking onto 2 connections, both the mini HDMI as well as the micro USB jacks, that act of docking may be difficult at best and cause the jacks to fail prematurely. Rather the connections feel solid, but not too solid, and have become easier after docking the cell several times. I no longer feel this will be an issue, but only the test of time will verify.As for the usefulness of the dock, it works GREAT for all intended purposes!  When initially docking the phone, the phone will pop up a menu allowing the user to select between a bedside / alarm mode or a desk / phone / business type mode (among others). This is a very useful feature I now wish the original Droid had offered the past couple of years.As expected the docking station works flawlessly with both my DROID 4 as well as my Xoom.

B006GQWTZQ,A1HN5HYFLH9PV0,Sean D.,"[0, 0]","I bought this from Radioshack about 2 years ago as my first smartphone. I was super psyched about being able to use apps and mobile data and what not.The best feature overall is the physical QWERTY keyboard. If I had the option, this would be on all of my smartphones. However, there's an issue with the design in this keyboard. The track on the keyboard that extends and retracts from the screen is fairly thin (there are two) and can become damaged. What happens is it forms a behavior on how it feels like closing after a while and requires you to push one end of the phone before the other end, otherwise one track will trigger while the other is stuck.One serious con about this phone is that it is outdated. The processor on this generation of Droid cannot meet the expectations of the apps that are in the market today. I would frequently use my phone for nothing but texts and calls, and apps would run in the background without my knowledge and slow the phone to a halt and thus be infuriating. The only way to restart the phone would be to remove the battery which, in the end, would cause software damage and data corruption.Don't get me wrong, the look and feel of the phone is wonderful. If you're not looking to use this phone for many, many apps, then by all means please buy this phone. But whatever you do, do not put a case on the phone as the case will misalign the track on the phone and cause future anguish. For me, I dropped my phone once and it was never the same.TL;DR (too lazy, didn't read) - I gave this a 3/5 simply because of the phone track on the keyboard being easily misaligned and the processor being too old to handle current generation apps. I would recommend you research into this phone further if you don't believe me.",3.0,1398470400,"04 26, 2014",Motorola Droid 3 Verizon Xt862 Verizon Cell Phone,104.75,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518OyQl-OIL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 4609},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

If you did, forget everything you read, because in the few months between then and now, this phone has taken a disastrous nosedive.Here's the deal: Lots of electronics these days, they're made to break. I was hoping that this one was an exception, but after a few months of gentle use and great care, I have been entirely disappointed.I won't make a grocery list of glitches and crashes, it'd take far too long. Just know that if you go into this thinking ""But I just want it for X feature"", you'll probably be disappointed. My cell signal is weak compared to other phones with the same company. The battery life is painfully weak. Buttons to call your contacts just don't respond. Occasionally, text fields will ignore all input, making it impossible to type anything, anywhere, until you reboot - which takes a weirdly long time. The wallpaper doesn't even stay up. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Don't even get me started on apps - native, purchased, downloaded, they crash all the same.This phone's strongest selling point is the Google Play Store, which is expansive, reasonably-priced, and very secure. However, that comes with any Droid, and if you are looking into the Droid OS, don't let this discourage you - I hear wonderful things about other Droid phones. But this isn't the one for you. And mind, this isn't just one buggy phone. Many reviewers agree with me, including my own sister, who got the phone at the same time I did and is struggling just as much.Bottom line: I'm surprised this thing ever reached shelves.

B006MGPG28,A2I2A7N3OCPNW4,"T. A. Daniel ""Alex""","[4, 5]","This accessory is especially made for the DROID RAZR MAXX: the phone has a more consistent thickness (as compared to the sloping back of the original RAZR).  Right now, I kind of have a love hate relationship with the HD Dock. To put simply, it does exactly what it's supposed to, but it is bogged down in a clunky interface.THE GOOD:Like I said, the HD Dock does exactly as it is advertised. Once you plug in your DROID RAZR, a screen prompts you to decide how you would like to treat your docking station. Would you like it as a bedside clock? Enabling this option grants a large time display coupled with a few music options. Would you like it as an office call center? Enabling this option creates a few icons to allow for quick and easy communication (phone, text, group meetings, etc...) It looks really nice, and it charges the phone well. If you sit at a desk during the day, this is a nice little accessory to own.THE BAD:Unfortunately, a few interface design choices offer clunky use with the HD Dock. This dock forces your phone into the aforementioned modes, but if you want to use your phone as its normal interface, you may as well just disconnect it from its station. If you need to access your calendar, or any other app, you will need to repeatedly press the Back button until you come to your original homescreen. Using the touchscreen while in its docking station also proves to be a little annoying; it's much much easier to browse the internet on the phone via handheld methods as opposed to this.I'm puzzled as to why this is labeled ""Rapid Wall Charger;"" my phone seems to take much longer to charge using this station than it does by simply plugging it into the wall. The lack of customization options also proves to be really annoying after using the device for a while; users have to operate by what Motorola think you do in your office (or whatever interface option you have chosen).THE HUH?:No USB connection options? This limits consumers to only being able to use wall/AC Adapter plugins to provide power to this station. While the options that the phone provides regarding interface are fine (Office, Bedside Clock, etc...), I would have liked to see some kind of customization with this feature. For example, for music, you will need to rely on Motorola's music service -- you can't enable Google Music or Amazon MP3 for instance without exiting out of the dock options entirely.OVERALL:This device is fine. At $25+, it's not exactly a bargain, but it's worth the money if you spend a lot of time at a desk. There are a few strange manufacturing options, and these missteps only go to show how much potential an idea like this would have given a bit better execution.",3.0,1344729600,"08 12, 2012",Motorola HD Dock for DROID RAZR MAXX - Non-Retail Packaging - Black,7.83,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ii1hcKJmL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 13759},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers']]"

They are pretty cheap to replace if you are handy with the Youtube tutorial.Shortcoming number one- Battery life. Over the last two years I learned to have chargers everywhere I need to be. The good news here is all the different docks and chargers are high quality and dirt cheap. The real lifesaver is the Lapdock. The battery in that can save your butt when you are away from other power. A full charge when new lasted for about 10 hours without significant use but only half that if you use wifi or background intensive apps. I had to replace the factory battery last year but it was so cheap I didn't even mind.Shortcoming two- The Motorola version of android is kinda limited and there are frequent compatibility issues with apps. It was better with Jellybean because Motorola and Verizon really bloated it on the updates. So much of the bloat is rooted in and you can't uninstall it. Root is your friend. The risk isn't so high because the phone has been around awhile now.  I rooted the phone and rolled it back to the more enjoyable jellybean.Conclusion.

B007154KNK,A4YXMH6WB73MN,Jason Harrell,"[9, 11]","OK, so I bought this for traveling to use the navigation and it works well.  The only thing that doesn't really work for me is the charging.  It works to a degree, but not as I had hoped.  So to explain a little further, when I use the navigation, and the battery was charged down to say 40 or 50 %, I have it plugged into the lighter socket and the battery doesn't deplete, but it doesn't increase either.  I used to to drive about 2.5 hours and it stayed at 50% the whole trip.  On the way home, I used the navigation and radio app at the same time, and the battery actually drained as I used it.  I was hopeful that the charging would be better.  Still haven't decided if I want to keep it or no because of that.Please note that the audio on mine playing thru the provided jack and into the Aux in of my car works flawlessly.  The sound is awesome.  Maybe I got a bad charger part and other got a bad audio jack.The suction works perfectly for me.  Didn't fall off once.Also, sometime when I dock the phone and try to lock in the charger part, it doesn't go in easily.  I have to carefully press, release, press, etc, until it goes in.And, no, for those asking, you cannot use any case when using this.  You must remove it from the case.  I have a few easy ones to remove, so that isn't a problem for me.I know that using navigation, especially in junction with i heart radio or Pandora, will use more battery life, but I thought since it was plugged in to charge, and yes the charge icon is showing charging, I figured it would still charge somewhat.I will try to use the phone by itself without any apps or anything running, to see if this charger does work.  But I haven't traveled anywhere since that trip other than a short trip to work and back.  Last time I tried this, for about a half an hour, it went from 20% to 21% in 30 minutes.  My standalone charger was much quicker than that.

B007154KNK,AM1J3LBHI5WT8,J. Green,"[0, 0]","First of all, the good points:- Holds my phone securely - phone has never fallen out of the dock (I do not have any skins/cases/etc attached to the phone).- Stable charging interface - the micro USB receptacle on the phone is not subjected to twists or bends as with a standard cable.- Car dock functionality - automatically comes on when plugged into the dock (no need for additional software).  Provides one-touch interface for navigation, music, calls, or maps.  I can customize the car dock homescreen as desired to provide quick access to the apps that I use the most.  AND the phone is charging while using battery-hogging navigation or internet music.- Seamless integration with car stereo - Music and sound (including navigation voice directions) are played through my car speakers (via 3.5mm AUX jack on my stereo).- Supports music over USB - no need to attach a multitude of cables.  I insert the phone into the dock, push the charger plug into the micro USB receptacle, press a button, and music plays.- Two USB charging ports - one is for the dock, and the other is for your passenger's phone or other USB-powered accessories (great for me since I only have one cigarette lighter power receptacle in the car).Now the bad:- My charger plugs into a cigarette outlet, and there is considerable alternator whine introduced to the audio.  Would be better if a noise filter had been included with the dock.- Other noise introduction - even with the power plug disconnected from the cigarette lighter, miscellaneous noise is still audible.  While no alternator whine, buzzing, popping, and static can be heard, even when the phone is not inserted into the dock.  Not sure if the 3.5mm audio jack is acting as a giant antenna or if the noise is generated from the USB connection to the dock itself.- The sticky stuff isn't.  The suction cup on the dock either attaches to the windshield (which blocks my view) or a little plastic &#34;plate&#34; with double-sided tape for attachment to the dashboard.  The double-sided tape loses its stickyness, especially if the car gets hot.  This may not be a problem for you if your car interior doesn't get warm while sitting outside in the sun in August...  One bump and the whole dock fell from where it was mounted.  It also helps if the spot where you attach the disc is smooth and flat (in which case, you'd probably just use the suction cup itself).- Suction cup only.  It would have been appreciated if there were other mounting options such as A/C vent, but you have to use the suction cup, either alone or in conjunction with the plastic disc.In summary, it suits my needs: keeping my phone charged while providing navigation and music.

B007154KNK,A1XX3X9SVUI6QD,Universal Cynic,"[43, 44]","For the most part, I am comparing this to official Motorola car dock for my Droid 1.  This car dock for the MAXX is a GREAT improvement and shows Motorola can actually incorporate some good ideas.First, I made sure to research docks before getting one.  Which can be hard since this one didn't have a ton of user reviews right away.  Quickly I did learn that what Verizon was pushing in their stores was not the same as could be ordered from Motorola and elsewhere.  My biggest draw was the integrated audio.  This is a great idea and, in my opinion, worth the premium over the Verizon (which doesn't have the integrated audio cable).  My old Droid dock was just a holder for the phone.  I had to supply the charging cord and the aux cable (which went to the 3.5mm jack in the phone).  It got cluttered, but hey, that's the way is was 2 years ago.This dock for the MAXX has the connector that slides in to lock the phone in place, charge it, and place audio.  Only one cable that goes into the back of the dock.  Very clean.  2nd USB port is also a plus.  The ""horn"" that comes with this dock has the same size ball as my old Droid dock, as well as my old Garmin, so use which ever you like.  I like my old Garmin because it is more compact and uses a smaller disk.  I haven't had any issue with this dock losing suction, so I'm happy there.  Also, just pressing the phone into the dock without inserting the USB/audio connector is easy and seems to keep the phone in there pretty well.  It isn't to hard to pull it out, just watch for where the volume buttons are so you don't change them accidentally.I have one gripe.  I use a bluetooth device to [sometimes] talk when I'm driving.  This device is also capable of playing music from my phone.  With my old setup (Droid,dock), I would have BT broadcast enabled on the device, the music to BT option enabled, and a cable in the headphone jack going to my car stereo.  I'm listening to something from my phone and it plays on the car stereo.  When I get a call, it pauses the music on the phone, answers the call via BT device, I talk, hang up, music resumes over car stereo.  Perfect. With the MAXX and its dock, I no longer need to plug anything into the 3.5mm jack while I'm in the car.  The problem is when I have BT function enabled, music to BT option enable, and the integrated USB/audio connect inserted everything is pushed to the BT device.  If I turn off the BT device or disable the BT function on the phone, then music plays through the car stereo.  If I forego the dock and just use an aux cable going to the 3.5mm jack on the phone, then everything works great (as it did w/ the Droid).  This seems like a major oversight and I would think that it is just a software issue (but hey, I didn't design this thing).  Now, this is probably more a flaw of the phone than of the dock, but since Motorola makes both the phone and the dock and both of the items work exclusively with each other, I think people need to know about it. There is no reason the integrated USB/audio connector should affect the transfer of functions to the BT any differently than the 3.5mm jack.I'll gladly edit if I find out anything new on the BT issue or if an update fixes it.  Overal, great product at an acceptable price, with one oversight.==================================================================================================================Edit 6/8/12I've noticed that over the past month the audio crackles when going over bumps and rough roads.  It is the micro USB connection of the cable to the dock that is failing.  When I hold the connection rigid or switch to using the 3.5mm jack then there are no issues.  After looking at the micro USB side of the cable under magnification I can see that several of the metal prongs are flatter than others.Now, I first have to admit that I do not drive on the smoothest roads, and even for Wisconsin I think these are some of the worst roads around.  I would still expect better performance than lasting 3 months.  I have taken the review down from 4 stars to 2 because of this.  And to think that I was disappointed with getting only 1 year out of the bad retaining tab on the original Droid....  I expected better from Motorola.  I don't think that expecting this to last more than 3 months was too high.",2.0,1332028800,"03 18, 2012",Motorola DROID RAZR MAXX Vehicle Navigation Dock with Rapid Vehicle Charger - Non-Retail Packaging - Black,56.9,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41C%2Bqd5Me3L._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 26584},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Car Accessories', 'Car Kits']]"

Even if your normal driving environment is someplace where the law hasn't caught up with technology, a Bluetooth-enabled hands free solution is just a good way to keep your focus where it belongs...on the road.The Roadster 2 paired easily with two separateHTC Evo phones. Incoming call quality through the integrated speaker was satisfactory, and callers reported good quality via the Roadster 2.If you get tired of losing aux audio input cords (or drive a car without one), you can use the Roadster 2 to stream audio from your phone's apps through an integrated FM transmitter to your car's radio. This wasn't always a strong or steady signal (and I'm not sure if it's because of a crowded FM spectrum where I live or signal strength through the cars root to the antenna above my rear windshield). You can also stream music through the integrated speaker in the Roadster 2, but I'm not sure why you'd want to (what's fine for a phone call doesn't do justice to music you like...).This device recognizes when you enter or leave the car (perhaps by the noise of the car door closing??, and battery life is quite long.

B007AQF0WK,A3MFORLOKIOEQY,Amazon Customer,"[52, 60]","I ordered this device because I've always like the concept of a speakerphone hands free. I find this one to be very easy to setup and use, with good call quality when used with the FM radio, fairly useful Android Apps, and clear (if a bit sparse) instructions.The device is a nice looking silver. It clips onto the sun visor in the car. All the setup and connections are by voice prompts, making it unnecessary to remember a bunch of button combinations to use it. There are three buttons on the front (as it hangs from the visor) for mute, hang up, and dial. On the under side of the device, towards the windshield, there are buttons for music play/pause, volume / tuning +/-, and an ""FM"" button to change the speaker from internal to the FM radio. The FM radio connection works by having the handsfree device transmit at very low power to an unused channel.ProThe voice prompts make it extremely simple to use compared to many headsets. When first turned on, it provides instructions on how to pair to a phone. It also speaks the name of the device when connection is made.It can be paired with two phones simultaneously.The device has power saving features; it shuts down after 10 minutes, although the instructions also say that is will then subsequently re-pair. I don't see how this works without running the device constantly. The manual speaks of turning on when you open the car door. This was about the only part of the manual that didn't make a lot of sense. EDIT: After more use, I have discovered that the device apparently listens for the door opening, and powers itself back up. This is a nice feature.The manual is short, but informative. Obviously the designers decided to put the needed instructions in the device as voice prompts, and it works very well.When connected to the FM radio, the sound quality is outstanding. The device tells you the frequency being used when you push the ""FM"" button, and the ""+"" and ""-"" buttons will auto seek the next available frequency. Once I found a good frequency, everything was great. In this mode, the radio volume controls are used instead of any controls on the device. UPDATE: The FM tunes frequencies from 88.3 to 107.9.If you have an Android phone, you can go to the market and download the two apps that work with the phone. the first app is MOTOSPEAK, which is simply outstanding. It allows you to make and answer calls (which is run of the mill stuff), but it also allows you to READ and SEND text messages. This is really great.The second app is the Motorola Car Finder App (descriptive but not the catchiest name). It makes a note of your location when you are no longer connected to the device. You can then load the app and see a satellite picture of the car location. It works fine, but I don't generally run my GPS - and the program issues complaints about being unable to access the satellite unless location services with GPS is on. Since the program automatically launches when one is connected to the device, I ended up uninstalling it. But for people who visit large malls or parking lots, it may be useful.The device will stream music from your phone. The quality is good, but there are no controls other than play and pause (the same button does  both). The handsfree will answer and make calls while the music is engaged; it pauses the music while the other functions are working. Overall, a good job.Con:Not a super ""con"" for me (I use Android phones), but I'm surprised that there isn't an Iphone app. This limits the devices additional capability to Android phones. I list it here for those Iphone users who may be interested in the device.When not connected to the FM, the call quality was not very good at the distant end. Also, the speaker sounded a bit tinny. I plan to use the FM radio option.There is only one button to control the music playing, so it doesn't really provide much control of the music. I wish there were more controls; it would be nice to be able to skip a track, for example.The device makes a REALLY annoying loud ""PING"" sound when it is turned off. Maybe it is designed to be left on, but it is very intrusive, and unnecessarily loud.UPDATE 3 APR 12: When receiving a call, the device announces only the number, not the person (even if the caller is in the phone book). Other hands free devices I have owned have announced the person. I still like this one best!Summary:A good choice when used with the FM capabilities. The send / receive text message capability is particularly nice. Highly recommended.EDIT: After more time, I can report that this device is still my preferred hands free. However, there are two things to report. First, it has mysteriously disconnected from my phone once. Second, when it powers back up ""automatically"" (I presume by hearing the doors open), if it is in FM mode, it switches back to internal speaker mode. This would not be a problem except that when I start up the car, the FM radio is still on and makes static until I manually switch the Roadster 2 back to ""FM"" mode. Otherwise, this has been a stellar device.EDIT 2 Oct 12: It still has that habit of suddenly powering down at infrequent times, with that loud ""BING"" sound (well, at least one cannot miss it!). I simply slide the power switch off and on and it picks right back up. The great feature set keeps me liking it even with this problem.",5.0,1332460800,"03 23, 2012",Motorola Roadster 2 Universal Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone - Retail Packaging - Silver,53.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GtOoktvdL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 711},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories']]"
B007AQF0WK,A3AYSYSLHU26U9,Amazon Deity,"[3, 4]","I was excited to try this with my new iPhone 4S.  The size is perfect.  Not overly big and not too small.  Unlike other speakerphones I have used, the Motorola 89556N is much narrower and takes less space. I am using it in my restored 1984 Mustang.Paring was extremely simple.  Just power it up and listen to the voice prompts.  Most speakerphones now turn on or off automatically once it senses the vehicle's door has been opened or shut and your phone is in range.  It announces that the power is on.  It is quite amazing when you think about it.  The call buttons in front of the unit are contoured perfectly for easy identification and access.In regards to clarity and sound, so far so good.  I have not heard any complaints from callers and I have not had any problems understandings the person on the other end. As calls come in, the names are announce correctly for the most part and the unit recognizes my command to answer or ignore the calls.The one feature I really liked that my Jabra does not have is the FM scan feature.  It will scan the FM channels for a clear frequency and then tell you what it is.  That is much easier then searching by increments.Now for all the extras, if you don't have a Motorola smartphone...forget about them.  They are more specifically designed for Motorola brand phones and the apps are not available in iTunes for iPhone users.  The one good thing about the new iPhone 4S is Siri, I can always just use Siri to send out or read my text messages through the speakerphone instead of using the app.Overall, it is a nice unit but it is intended more towards Motorola Smartphones users.",3.0,1332460800,"03 23, 2012",Motorola Roadster 2 Universal Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone - Retail Packaging - Silver,53.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GtOoktvdL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 711},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories']]"
B007AQF0WK,AIFLY2HF8NS8U,Andre Lawrence,"[1, 2]","The Roadster is Motorola's 1-piece, Bluetooth, car speaker and GPS-enabled navigation system.  The system also has the ability to act as a receiver for streaming audio, FM-radio and as a voice-activated personal assistant via the Android app's ""My Motospeak"" and ""Motorola Car Finder.""With a measurement of 2.5"" x 3.75"" x 1.5"", the device is noticeably broad.  And, that's not a negative criticism in anyway, but just an observation.The beautiful metallic silver front has a touchpad on the bottom that allows you to control the music-audio functions.  The top keypad row controls the phone functions.  The right side is where the micro usb charge port and power switch is located.******  *******My trip to the grocery store a mile away provided me with perfect opportunity to see how the device works out.I engaged the Motorola Car Finder app and it immediately asked me to take a snapshot.  This, I discovered was more for my benefit as a snapshot would help me to remember where I was parked from a street-level view.  But, I declined and went on to the next screen.  Just as I arrived at the mall, I received a phone call.  The speaker on this device is loud!Just before the conversation ended, I inquired about how well I sounded.  I was impressed that her answer was ""fine"" considering it was somewhat windy as I was coming into the parking lot.A few moments later, I turned on the My Motospeak and had the system ""text Yvette!"".  Within seconds, a voice blared out, ""Which number?""  Afterwards, the system repeated the message I spoke to it.Pretty impressive.*****  *******After a couple of weeks of playing around with all of the features, there are some minor things that I'd like to see in a future version.1.  I wouldn't mind seeing a glass display instead of the metal mesh that covers the speaker.  So, that display can give you a visual of where you're at or who's calling.  Any speakers can be moved to the sides and to the bottom.2.  I'd like there to be included a micro usb to ac adapter.  The device comes with almost no charge and it took a couple of hours of it being plugged in before the battery indicator light turned green.This is important because the kit only comes with a car charger.  If you're parked in an area and will be there for a considerable amount of time, I wouldn't leave this $100 device lying around and especially not plugged in.  This means, on the other side, that you'll need to have an ac adaptor handy so the device can stay charged while indoors.3.  I'm not crazy about the $100 price tag.  If it had a glass display and extra cords, maybe.  But, by itself, I think a fair price would be in the $50-$60 range.So, there you have it.

B007AQF0WK,A2D7B5I7ZQ51XL,Anthony Pittore,"[4, 5]","Directly after having my in-ear Bluetooth headset finally die, I received this new Motorola Roadster 2: a portable car speakerphone with universal Bluetooth capability.  Due to the strict regulations on using the phone while driving, I was hoping this would be a superior replacement to what I've had previously.  It definitely is.  To be clear about this review, I just want to point out that I will be using the Roadster 2 with an iPhone 4, so I can't guarantee equal results for all cell phones.To start out: The unpackaging.  In the box, we receive only 3 items: The speaker, a car charger, and the Quick Start Guide.  Personally, I don't consider a 25-page manual to be a ""quick"" start guide, but oh well.  Anyway, the manual starts by congratulating us on owning this fine piece of machinery.  I'm honoured, Motorola.  It also goes on to mention some of the different functions of the product, including:- Simultaneously connect with two phones.- Hear caller's name or number, and use your voice to answer or ignore calls.- Switch between your FM radio and car kit speaker.- Hear voice prompts to guide you on connections, battery level, and other functions.The first few steps are clear enough.  Plug it into your cigarette lighter to charge (it can be used while charging), hook it onto your visour, and switch it on.  One nice little power-saving feature is that the Roadster 2 will turn off if you take your phone away, then turn back on when you return.  Very helpful and convenient.  To start up, you have to pair your phone with the Roadster 2.  Every phone's different, so consult your manual if you're unsure.The most important feature is making/receiving calls.  To make a call, you can either dial from your phone directly and have it routed to the Roadster 2, or hit the voice command and tell the phone whom you want to call.  For iPhone users (at least), specify home, work, mobile, etc., after the name.  The dialing process is easy, though it does momentarily stop it from being ""hands free.""  Receiving calls is even easier.  When a call comes in, the voice prompts tell you who's calling and you simply respond ""answer"" or ""ignore.""  It even pauses your music for you.There is also a music feature with the Roadster 2.  You can actually play the music directly through your speaker, though the quality is about as good as you'd expect from a small speaker.  You can also run your sound through an FM transmitter, which is another nice & convenient feature.One issue I do have with the speaker is that one of the coolest features can't be used with my iPhone.  This feature, which is the ability to find your car with your Smartphone, is currently only good for Android users.  There is an app that can be downloaded that, unfortunately, can't be downloaded for the iPhone yet.  Hopefully they fix this soon.Overall, this is a very good hands-free speakerphone that is convenient & well made.  Well recommended.",4.0,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",Motorola Roadster 2 Universal Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone - Retail Packaging - Silver,53.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GtOoktvdL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 711},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories']]"

B007AQF0WK,A125H61XJXCB1G,"ARK ""casual shopper""","[0, 0]","Before purchasing this product, I reviewed its instruction manual to find a sentence saying ""You can use your car kit while unplugged or plugged into the charger."" So, I purchased a smartphone-sized solar charger and and placed it on the windshield with velcro tape near the product, hoping that it would constantly be charging the product. I chose this way because I wanted to avoid running a USB charger cable all the way to the cigar lighter plug or periodically attach and detach a charger plug to the product.My plot failed. Once the product is fully charged, keeping a USB charger plugged to the product seems to disable the product; while a charger plug is attached, the green ""CHARGE"" LED remains on, but the ""STATUS"" LED never turns on and the product does not respond to any action such as pushing buttons or sliding the power switch back and force. The only way to restore the product to function is to remove the charger USB cable from the product. It is not satisfactory to disconnect the cable from the solar charger end, but the micro USB connector needs to be disconnected from the product. Disappointing...The product has a few good features like ability to register and use two phones, voice announcement of the caller ID, etc. For the iPhone, voice dialing actually activates iPhone's voice control so that I think I use any of iPhone's voice controlled features.One of the annoying features of the product is music playing. My daughter borrows my iPhone to watch YouTube on the rear seat.

Simply, plug in the car charger, clip the speakerphone onto your visor, switch it on and follw the easy, helpful voice command steps. In two minutes the speakerphone is ready to be used (even without being fully charged)....The device automatically turns itself on when you open the car door and turns itself off when your phone is about 33 feet away from where you leave the car; thus saving battery life....Very clear sound quality; with  dual microphone noise cancellation and echo control settings that work pretty well to  block out background noise....Dialing is as easy as tapping the ""Call"" button and following the easy voice prompts. Receiving a call is totally hands-free; in that the voice prompts will instruct you to say Answer or Ignore....Good battery life, allowing talk time up to 20 hours,and up to 3 weeks of standby time...Allows two phones to be connected simultaneously....You can listen to calls and, if you have a smartphone you can stream music, through either the device's 2-watt speakers OR using the FM transmitter so that you listen through your car speakers.Two other very cool features are available to Android users, but iPhone users and other non-android users (of which I am one) are likely to be annoyed by the fact that the apps that can be downloaded for free are not available to them. One of these features (available by downloading the MyMotospeak App) enables the user to listen to incoming text messages read aloud, then using voice commands to respond or initiate texts. The second feature, available by downloading the Car Finder app, automatically marks your car location using GPS technology, so that should you forget where you parked your car, you'll be easily led to your car's location.Overall, while the Motorola Roadster 2 is a very good, easy to use speakerphone, I don't know if it's worth its $99.99 price tag if you don't have a smartphone, and particularly an android-based phone.",4.0,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",Motorola Roadster 2 Universal Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone - Retail Packaging - Silver,53.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GtOoktvdL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 711},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories']]"
B007AQF0WK,A2SZLNSI5KOQJT,Carrie,"[9, 10]","UPDATE: I recently started carrying a Lumina 521 and the original 710. The Roadster recognizes both when I enter my car. Since my contacts had already been paired with the Roadster, there was no need to re-do that step.My original speakerphone was a Jabra Journey which I purchased locally at a warehouse store.  I loved the fact that I could talk & text over this little machine.  The Jabra Journey synced quickly with my phone (windows Lumia 710) & it was easy to use.  However, it died within 8 months of my purchase.I researched & read reviews on other speakerphones before making the decision to purchase this Motorola Roadster 2. I almost went with the BlueAnt S4, but decided that the Roadster was a little newer & would pair better with my cell phone.Overall, I am happy with the Roaster 2.  Here is a breakdown of my impressions of both speakerphones:Roaster 2:1) Synced well with my Lumia 710, although I had to plug it into my computer first to download contacts;2) Takes a little longer to connect to my phone when I get into my car than the Jabra;3) Doesn't cut me off & try to use the bluetooth when I exit the car & go inside;4) Doesn't come with a wall charger (only car charger);5) Have yet to figure out how to do FM radio (not a deal killer for me);6) Phone callers can understand me even with road noise (in a heavier car that didn't produce as much road noise, but had the speakerphone further from my face, the Roadster 2 performed well & understood my commands);7) Roadster 2 seems to understand my voice commands slightly better than Jabra;8) Roadster 2 buttons are slightly harder to push than the Jabra;9) Battery life seems slightly shorter than the Jabra;10) Roadster has volume buttons, so volume adjustment is easyJabra Journey:1) Synced easily with my Lumia 710 - no need to hook up & download phone contacts;2) Fairly quick connection to my phone once I got into the car;3) Long bluetooth range, so the bluetooth would override my phone when I was outside of my car (in house and/or office);4) Comes with both a wall charger & a car charger;5) Phone callers sometimes had a hard time understanding me because of road noise - would have to put the device closer to my mouth (I did not use the Jabra in a vehicle that didn't produce much road noise, but assume that the call quality would be better);6) Jabra sometimes had a hard time understanding my commands (understood ""Dial"" better than ""Call"");7) Buttons are easy to push;8) Battery life is excellent.9) No volume buttons - have to adjust volume on your phoneOverall, I like the Roadster 2 slightly better than the Jabra Journey.  Even without considering the Jabra died on me & has better (responsive) buttons, the Roadster 2 seems to understand my commands a little better than the Jabra & that is what is important because I have a small car & encounter road noise.  In a heavier car or one without so much road noise, the Jabra would probably perform well too (then you need to take into consideration the fact that the Jabra may have a short life).

Guess what?  I got exactly what I wanted!This Roadster is easy.  I still have not learned how to use it's features; but, some features jump out to be recognized.  First, I charged it for about 2 hours.  At first, when I turned it on it announced ""Battery is Low"".  Now it announces: ""Battery is High"" and it has been high for 3 days now, without additional charging.After charging, you have to link the device to your phone.  I went to my phone settings and checked ""blue-tooth"". Then I turned on the Roadster.  I do not know what happened next, it just announced ""pairing successful?"".  That was it.  I am using a Motorola DROID RAZR, that may or may not make a difference.  I do not know one way or the other.So I attached it to my visor and turned it on.  When I get in the car, it makes a sound to notify me that it is connected to my phone and what my battery level.  When I physically dial to make a call, audio is clear through the Roadster speaker.  I did not have to do anything.  Then a call came in and I did not know what to do.  Roadster made it easy, it identified the caller and asked me to accept or deny.  I did not touch the phone.  When the call was ended, it hung up for  me.  Now I know: I push a big button on Roadster and it asks me for a command.  I simply speak: ""Call""  it responds with give a name or  something to that effect.  I then speak the name and it must automatically check my contact directory; because, it found the name and asked me if I wanted to call home, office line 1 or 2.  I simply answer the questions and it goes right through.  So far it has not made a mistake.Roadster also uses an app to locate your car?  Unbelievable.  I already had the app installed on my phone so I just opened it.  Amazing, I did not have to go through any set up that I remember.  Yet, there was a picture of my house and a car in my driveway.  I pushed the directions button and it informed me I was 21 feet from the car.  Sure enough, it was about 21 feet away.  It is all automatic.  As I move, it tells me if I am getting closer or further from the car.Next, it has the ability to link to my car radio?  I do not know if I am suppose to buy something special to make that happen.  I have a wonderful feeling that I do not need to buy anything.  I pushed a button labeled FM.  It made a scan and announced a frequency for my radio.  I have not tried it yet; but, I think it will broadcast directly to that frequency on my radio.  I will have to try it to know for sure.  I will report back later on this.Bottom line: I decided to buy the features that I wanted to own: Regardless of price. As I learn more about the product, (the manual does not tell me much at all), Roadster seems to be hassle free.  Volume is good enough to hear in the back seat. It looks nice and I think it is going to do everything I wanted in a Blue-tooth car kit.  At this time; I feel confident to recommend it with 4 stars.  If it had an operating manual, it would have all 5 stars.  I will use it for awhile and follow up later.P.S. I could have made this purchase anywhere on-line. I chose Amazon for free shipping and if I would have decided to return it after the first week, I would not have had a problem.  I trust Amazon.com.I have had a chance to use this a few days now and have great news: The charger recharges in as little as 15 minutes and I have only had to recharge once, so far.  I also decided to try the charger on my RAZR MAXX.  It was at 80% and I plugged it in thinking it could charge during my 45 minute drive home.  After 10 minutes it started signaling it was fully charged and to unplug it.  This is good news.I also learned how to link it to my car stereo.  There were no instructions, so for a test, I pushed the FM button. It then announced the FM 1 frequency. Each time I pushed the plus or minus sign, it repeated the next available frequency up or down.  I chose one and let it go.  Just for the heck of it, I turned on my stereo and set it to the channel of my Roadster and let it be.  The phone rang in and I answered the call through the stereo.  That was great.  I thought I would have to buy something to link it to my car.  Apparently it puts out a broadcast signal of it's own to be received by the stereo.Then, since my radio was not working while I had it set to the frequency for my calls, I started playing my music from my RAZR.  I was astonished when the music came out of my car speakers.  Now everything is cycled through my stereo and the music stops for incoming calls.Special note: Select a channel that is not in use, locally.  Otherwise you will have your broadcast mixed with the competing broadcast.  I know there is more to learn about this Roadster.  As I learn, I will share.One last thing to add: Download the free ""My Motospeak"" to send/receive and read all your text messages while driving.

This was a good option, and it's worked out pretty well thus far.It's very simple to set up. It comes with a wall and car charger (micro USB). Just charge it up, turn it on and instantly it's in ""pairing mode"". Just search for bluetooth devices with your phone, find the Roadster, and pair it. Easy as pie.The unit automatically connects to your phone when it's in range (e.g. when you enter your car). Once you leave and are out of range, it goes into ""sleep"" mode. This way it saves power but makes it super convenient to connect and disconnect whenever you're in range. If you had to manually connect every time you entered your car, I would almost never use something like that. It announces that you've connected via bluetooth, and you're free to make/receive calls as you like.You can send the voice over your car speakers by setting the unit to transmit over a certain frequency. Overall, the sound quality is adequate. I can hear my wife speaking pretty well, but there are definitely times when it sounds like she's talking underwater. And if she moves the shade to block the sun, or moves her head away from the speaker, then forget it - you may as well not use it. The sensitivity on the microphone isn't nearly strong enough, especially when driving on noisy highways.Overall, the concept is good and this is a handy product. I'm still holding out for a unit that picks up sound better than this one.

B007AQF0WK,A3SMD3T0QTN109,Dustin Farahnak,"[327, 332]","This is my fifth bluetooth speakerphone, and the word that sums this one up best is ""cool"".Like all the other speakerphones I've used, pairing this with my phone was easy.  In this case, a recorded voice guides you through the process.  This comes with more controls than most (good clicky feeling buttons, too), making music playback easy.The FM transmitter is better thought out than products I've used in the past.  The recorded voice tells you the station the device is using (which is typical), but if you hold a volume button down, the unit will automatically scan the FM spectrum until it finds an unused frequency, then announce the channel.  This is a cool feature that is a lot safer than trying to drive while adjusting both car radio and speakerphone ten times, looking for a clear radio frequency.  This feature alone is probably enough to justify choosing this unit.The sound clarity is noticeably better than the others speakerphones I've used.  I credit this to the noise cancellation claims on the box, but what matters is that calls go through clear.  The people I've called have remarked on it.Battery life is roughly equivalent to the Jabra it replaced and far superior to the other speakerphones I've used.  I was on the phone for 50% of a routine six hour trip and the fourth drive was nearly completed before the recorded voice reported ""Low Battery"" (It's a nice touch that a voice reports the battery level whenever the device turns on).  Most speakerphones need to be charged after two trips (the Jabra needs to be charged approximately as often as this Roadster).And this segues nicely:All the other speakerphones I use are designed to be charged via USB.  This too has a microUSB port, but instead of a USB cable the box comes with a DC car charger (and it's a swanky looking DC charger).  This is so much better thought out.  I don't always have time to remove my speakerphone and charge it.  I often need to charge it in the car.  I don't want to buy an extra cable or have redundant cables.  The charger has a coiled (think old telephone handset) cord and a nice clip and is intended for serious use.  I really like it.  If you have a car that shuts off the DC power when the car isn't on, you might consider just leaving this thing plugged in forever.This product also detects when you enter and leave the car, pairing automatically.  I have to admit I didn't really have a problem hitting the button on my Jabra to initiate the pairing, but this is one less step.  Pretty slick.The Android app is quite cool.  It relies on your phone's location service, but you can also save a snapshot of your car's location.  I actually often take a snapshot when I leave my car at the airport, but now that process is more automated and organized.  I'm a huge fan.The lighter grey color fits the interior of my car much better than black speakerphones, too.  It looks sharp.This product retails for $20 more than the one it replaced, but I think it's worth the additional cost.",5.0,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",Motorola Roadster 2 Universal Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone - Retail Packaging - Silver,53.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GtOoktvdL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 711},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories']]"

B007AQF0WK,A2XA8CW5DF4MNZ,"Iron Man ""JON""","[0, 0]","The Motorola 89556N Roadster 2 Universal Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone is a great little device to reinforce safety while you drive. It is common knowledge that we SHOULD NOT answer our cell phones while driving but it is inevitable that no matter what the situation is, we tend to answer our cell phones while driving. I guess this would be true for majority of us the reason why a lot of us now buy bluetooth headsets. Having a headset planted in our ears increases awareness and minimizes distraction compared to holding the phone by hand or pushing it against your shoulders.The Motorola 89556N Roadster 2 Universal Bluetooth In-car Speakerphone reinforces the ""safety measure"" when you drive and talk on your cell phone. Set up for this bluetooth device was the typical plug & play. It did not take long for my phone to scan & pair with this device. It is ready to be used once it is paired. Placing it on the sun visor of you vehicle assures maximum performance since talking will come naturally and the projection of your voice will be frontal or facing the bluetooth device where the speaker is also located just below the control panel. The 2-watt speaker with noise and echo cancellation proved to be crisp and clear. The person I was talking to heard me precisely. No jitters or background noise of sorts. Everything I said was heard and comprehended by the other person on the phone. The controls are easy to reach, call function buttons and indicator lights are on the front of the device--volume control, mute button and the call answer/terminate button. No fumbling when you need to press a control button which is very convenient. The power button is on the side of the device allowing you to turn if off when not in use but with a stand by time of 3 weeks and a talk time of 20 hours, you may intentionally ""forget"" to turn it off. Comes with the ultra convenient car charger so you can charge and use it while on the go. With a little bit of manipulation on the controls, this device is also capable of voice prompts for basic functions like battery status, muting and unmuting the device and call status. This convenient speakerphone also comes with an FM transmitter so you can stream music from your device and can now be integrated with an android app that you can download to your phone to serve as a car finder. Very cool indeed!Overall, very impressed with this device.

I have been using a Motorola Oasis ear bud for over a year and I love the ease of use and sound quality.  I was certain that the Roadser 2 would be every bit as good as the Oasis and more.  Ease of use is certainly an aspect of the Roadster 2, but the sound quality leaves something to be desired.  Once I had my iPhone paired with this device I called my mom who is my go to person for helping me test out these types of products.  She found it difficult to hear me and said I sounded far away.

I suppose Motorola was unaware that many cars cut the power to the car's outlets when the motor is not running.  It took me several days of running errands to get the battery fully charged before it's initial use.  I could have used it sooner if it had an ac adaptor.Consumers with an Android phone can download a free app to tap into more features that this speakerphone offers, such as the ability to locate your car if you have forgotten where you parked.

B007AQF0WK,A1VWYO33PSYOE3,Kleinwald,"[1, 1]","I ordered the Motorola Roadster 2 after owning the original T325 Motorola hands free car speakerphone for several years. The T325 was the best hands free device that I have had after using several Plantronics and Samsung ""in the ear"" type of headsets. It's still working and I use it currently. With my iPhone it eliminates the need to upgrade my car to one that has integrated hands free calling and is much cheaper than getting a new car!Since I was a happy Motorola user, and when I noticed that my father was having problems with driving and using his phone, I promptly got him a new Motorola Roadster for his birthday. After playing with the Roadster I was so impressed that I decided to upgrade my own hand free device. When I went on Amazon, I realized there was updated Roadster 2 (silver case versus black) so I promptly ordered it. I figured with the update and paying $80 versus $50 I would get an improved product.I got the device yesterday and starting playing with it and yes, it is silver in color. However, as of this writing I have not noticed any noted improvement in performance over my dad's Roadster or my original T325. Also, the most troubling thing is that they tout the ability to hear and dictate text messages as a feature. This is one of the main reasons I got this unit.  However, what they forget to mention is that this feature is PHONE DEPENDENT. Meaning if you don't own an Android phone, this feature is not accessible. So if you have an iPhone or any other phone that does not use the Android OS, you just paid for a feature you can't use! Since I am a heavy text user, this was an appealing feature but now that I realized that I cannot use it, I'm bummed. Shame on you Motorola for not noting this in the product detail description!All in all, I'll probably keep the unit since I need another hands free device for my third car anyways but I seriously question the value of this Roadster 2 over the original Roadster. I'll also reconsider when it comes time to upgrade whether to buy another Motorola product.  I'll update my review later if I do realize after more time using the device, that it is in fact, better.Update: Since my last review I have have had to order another one of these as I had an issue with battery draining completely to zero after charging it overnight 2 days before. Its never consistent and there are times where I will partially charge the battery and it comes back to life and says that its fully charged. I never had this issue with the older unit that I had. I got a new one and again, it has happened with the newer one after the first charge. I have recharged it again and am going to see if it works.

B007AQF0WK,A30R8VFR16RE32,Kristin,"[110, 127]","I installed this in a 2008 Audi A4, and paired it with two different iPhones (a 4 and a 4S).The first thing I noticed is that the unit is smaller than I had anticipated from the photos.  I posted pictures for you, with a Pilot G-2 pen for comparison.The pairing process was SUPER simple.  Just follow the directions and the prompts--no problem.  With the iPhone(s) there was no need for the 0000 code.The voice activation software works well for calls (80% of the time it gets the name right), but voice texting is sadly lacking.  My boyfriend has a deep voice, and he had a really hard time (he finally gave up).  The idea is a good one, though, but needs some work.The ""Find My Car"" app ONLY WORKS ON certain MOTOROLA phones.  There is NO app for the iPhone.  I was disappointed in this.  The initial read of the advertisement did not specify, and it wasn't until I received the unit itself and read the paperwork that I saw that it was only for certain models of Motorola phones.  I searched the 'net for more possibilities, but no luck either in the Apple App Store nor the Motorola website.  I guess I cant' blame them for wanting to promote their own products, but they should specify this in the ad.  (Upon writing this review, it's still not specific on that in the ad.)As far as call quality, it all seems to depend on many factors.  Signal quality certainly affects your call quality (more so than your regular bluetooth earpiece).If your conversation is being held with another person on another hand free unit, it seems to really get fuzzy.  In many of  my conversations, the person I was talking to complained of a periodic clicking sound (I could not hear it).  I have never had this with my earpiece(s).When I spoke to people on their landlines, NO one complained and everyone said the call was great.  As the receiver of the call, on the landline it sounded clear as a bell.  As the receiver (of a call placed with this speakerphone), while I was on a cell phone, the call was less than perfect (fuzzy, but not so bad that I could not understand).While making calls from the Motorola speakerphone, it ranged from crystal clear to so fuzzy I couldn't understand what was being said at all.  (This is all in the same relative area, but varied constantly.)  It seems VERY susceptible to call degradation due to background noise (the Audi has very little of this, so if your car has lots of wind noise, this would not work for you).The unit looks good, and the backlights make it easy to see.  The charger cord could be longer, but is fine in the Audi.  (It would have been too short in my Suburban.)The speakerphone had no issues with finding the phone(s) when we entered the car, and could handle calls coming in on both lines while we were both in the vehicle.  Battery life is great--it's been charged for days and is still reading with ""good"" battery life left.  Charging didn't take long at all (less than a couple of hours--I left it plugged into the outlet in the Audi while I was at dinner and it was fully charged when I returned).I believe that if you are in a downtown area, with plenty of well maintained top of the line cell service, this could be a good addition to your car.  However, if you live in a rural area (as I do), there are many variables that could degrade your call.  Always have your bluetooth earpiece handy, as those simply do not have the issues that this does.

B007AQF0WK,A1CPRP3VFJRS1R,M. Anderson,"[0, 0]","I own the older Motorola T305 Bluetooth speakerphone and bought this one because I wanted to upgrade to something better and with more features.  The older T305 has exceptional sound quality and has always performed very well.  I bought this model because the T305 is significantly bulkier and lacks some of the more advanced features that this unit has (i.e., the FM Radio, noise cancelling, etc.).On the Roadster 2's maiden voyage, I called my wife, who immediately reported that I sounded muffled and she was having trouble understanding me.  I also noticed that her voice quality was quite a bit muffled compared to the T305.  I hung up, switched over to the T305, and called her back.  I repeated this switch several times, and concluded that this unit has significantly worse sound quality (in both directions) than the T305.If the audio was only bad in one direction, I might suspect that I got a defective product, i.e. if my wife said that I was muffled, but she was not, then I might suspect that the microphone on the unit was defective.  But, since the muffled voice quality persisted in both directions, I am more inclined to suspect that there's just something in the design of this unit that is responsible.  The difference between the T305 and this unit was subtle enough that I suspect it is the noise cancelling software, or some other design feature, rather than a defect.

B007AQF0WK,A8SAH956TO0DF,"Mark Urquhart ""marku""","[1, 1]",I bought Roadster 2 mainly becasue I have two older cars without aux for car stereo and to be able to BT stream through the FM radio.  I had read other reviews on the prior 505 model that noted that the older model was reviewed to have cleaner FM streaming without noise but that is out of production and you never know what you get used and new 505 from other obscure sites were more $$ than this R2.Took it on trip from CA foothils to Monterey through Bay area.  I find that the unit will work for me as FM streaming has pretty good sound free from backround static noise mainly ONLY IF the power charging cord is plugged in.  If the charger is not plugged in 1/2 of time you will get static sound drifting in backgorund even when finding the best unused frequency.  I wish this were not the case and find it surprising that according to other reviews Motorola actually went backwards to a weaker FM transmit than the old T505 - too bad as otherwise the unit is pretty good.  Since I like to run new battery units down 3 times from new full charge I'll probably use this as HF phone doing that and then keep plugged in streaming MP3 from Galaxy S3 after that.The Galaxy S3 S-voice seems to work fine through the R2. After reading poor reviews on the Motospeak app I decided to not install and will go with S3 S-voice.  Now if I could just find an app that would allow me to voice command dial number to use commands to navigate within my voicemail.  With S-voice I can program have it pause and dial codes to get in but not choose commands by &#34;dial 2&#34; or &#34;dial 4&#34;I would have rated this 4 or 5 stars if the FM noise was not present without the charger plugged in; or even some times with it plugged in.

B007AQF0WK,ALYIYCV6QZG11,Mike,"[2, 2]","I needed an option to connect my phone to my car stereo. I have an older car without an aux in plug nor does my car stereo have a bluetooth feature.This product was used with a Verizon Galaxy Nexus and a T-Mobile Galaxy Note 2.My review will primary be related to the FM feature as that is what I purchased the product for.  I purchased the Jabra Freeway Bluetooth Speakerphone at the same time to compare the two (spoiler alert - the Motorola Roadster 2 won hands down).I have used FM transmitters ever since the first one was released by Belkin for the original iPods.Review:The product paired to all my phones easily.  I have read the other reviews but for some reason my unit still continues to announce instructions on how to pair the device when not paired.  I can pair multiple phones at the same time and the unit will switch to the phone that is being used with one exception.  The first phone that pairs to the device is considered the primary phone and only the primary phone can be used as a multimedia device (music, etc).  The other phones are relegated to standard phone calls and text messages.If you download the Android Motorola app calls that come in while paired are announced verbally.  Assuming you have the app (again I have android phones so that is all I can speak to) the callers name is also displayed on the phone screen.  Most of the time callers can hear me although I have not found any system that eliminates all the outside noise from the call or is clear enough for me to hear completely all the time.When a text is received you are given the option to listen to it.  When you chose to send a text you can say it aloud.  The voice recognition is decent, about the same as Google.The FM transmitter is very strong.  I tune to a blank station and it comes in loud and clear.  I rarely have to adjust it even on trips and although not perfect it by far is the best FM transmitter I have ever used.Battery life is excellent.  I use this Monday - Friday for approximately 70 minutes a day.  The charge will last me anywhere from 2-4 weeks.It is not without its flaws though.The unit I have shuts off randomly.  It doesn't happen all the time but at least once a week.Changing the FM station is done via the volume buttons.  The station is announced each time you hit the corresponding button.  It makes it an awkward process to quickly go to another station that is far away from your current station.Without the unit being transmitted through my car speakers it is not loud enough to be heard clearly.  Keep in mind that I have hearing loss and as I get older it doesn't improve.Pros:-Strongest FM transmitter I have used-No issues pairing multiple phones-Announces calls and texts-Battery life is excellentCons:-Difficult changing channels rapidly using FM mode-Product shuts off occasionally-It is difficult for me to hear if I don't use the FM mode",4.0,1361836800,"02 26, 2013",Motorola Roadster 2 Universal Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone - Retail Packaging - Silver,53.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GtOoktvdL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 711},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories']]"

I'm so glad I did!  The setup requires loading the app, Motospeak, on my phone.  The app worked immediately and the setup was painless.  I clipped the Roadster on my visor, and it connected to my phone automatically. Every time I get in the car it plays a short musical tone, which lets me know it is working, and it also tells me the battery level.  By the way, the battery lasts a very long time, especially since I leave the Roadster on all the time.Once I choose my book or music, it plays immediately.  The speaker is very good for being so small.  I can also choose to use my car radio speakers.  I just push the FM button, it tells me what station to select, and when I do my book or music is transmitted through the speakers.  This usually works well, however, sometimes the radio sound becomes fuzzy or the station frequency changes.  This is a problem with the radio transmission, not the Roadster.  I have found that listening to books through the Roadster itself works fine, because the sound from its speaker is very clear.If I get a call, the music or book I'm listening to is placed on pause automatically and the Roadster announces either who is calling -  if the caller is in my Contacts - or the phone number of the incoming call.  I just say ""Answer"" and I'm connected.  The sound for the caller is excellent.  When the call ends, my book or music starts right back up.

I have used bluetooth headsets in the past, but the volume was never quite loud enough.  Because of this, I prefer using bluetooth speakers.

The calling party on the other end never complains about the clarity either.  I have not used the FM transmitter, so my experience is solely through the speaker on the item.Pairing the device with my iPhone 4 was very simple.  I did not bother reading the directions, and was able to set it up easily.  The unit itself looks good, and looks good clipped to my sun visor.  The clip appears to be very strong, and I have not had any problems with it falling off.  The unit is quite a bit smaller than what I had anticipated.  The charging cord appears to be heavy duty, and has a nice curling cord similar to a corded telephone.There is also a feature that allows you to find your car in a parking lot, etc.  However, this does not work for the iPhone.

It was only once I got addicted to the built-in hands-free phone setup in our new car that I started to miss it in the other vehicle.  I started trying this out, and it's not bad.  It paired up quickly with my iPhone, and the battery life was good enough that I was able to forget recharging on a daily basis.  I ended up plugging it in weekly just to top it off.  Sound quality coming in for calls was excellent, and the people I talked to thought it wasn't bad from my end.  I like the fact that it's designed to clip onto the visor, as I can push the visor up when I get out, and there's no real indicator that I've got something there that a thief might want to break a window to get.  I wasn't able to test out the car finder feature, as I don't have an Android phone.  But if you do, that's a very nice feature.Probably the best way to get used to using this is to play around with it indoors to get the hang of the pairing, commands, etc.  Much better to do it there than while you're trying to drive.Disclosure:Obtained From: Amazon Vine Review ProgramPayment: Free",4.0,1356307200,"12 24, 2012",Motorola Roadster 2 Universal Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone - Retail Packaging - Silver,53.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GtOoktvdL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 711},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories']]"

I have been taking my time searching for a reasonably priced device that would work for me.  After helping my son relocate from Arizona to Chicago, me driving a 16 foot Penske truck and him driving his Nissan I expedited my search.My son's car has a factory hands free device that came with the car. On the trip I communicated with him and my wife, at another location in Illinois, using an ear bud device that allowed me to drive hands free; however, I wear hearing aids that interfered with the ear buds.Today I went to the local Sprint Store about some issues I was having with my HTC telephone and for information about a hands free device.  Although, at $105 at their store, the customer service agent there recommended the Motorola Roadster 2 Universal Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone because its ""Dual Microphone Noise Cancellation and Echo Control setting block out background noise in the car better than other speakerphones""--8.5 DB noise reduction as compared to Blueant S4's 5.0 DB and Jabra Cruiser2's 3.5 DB.A bit reluctant, I asked the sales representative if she would install it, let me test it and return it if I was not satisfied.  She did and I was so embarrassed that I had her install it.  The device provides very simple oral step-by-step instructions.  You simply pick turn on your cell phone blue tooth, place the device on your visor, plug in your Roadster into the cigarette lighter and follow the instructions.Before making a call, make sure your cell phone blue tooth in turned on and your Roadster is turned on. Then, all you have to do is push a conveniently located raised symbol that activates the device.  An oral prompt asks you who you want to call.  You say, ""Call Home"" or any other contact on your cell phone contact list and the system contacts you.To hang up or to receive a call, you push a conveniently located raise telephone symbol.I listen to my calls through my car speakers and make calls through the Roadster device; however, the device has a 2-watt speaker if you would prefer to listen to your calls or stream music through it.Additionally, the user can download the Application ""My Motospeak""  for free.  This App allows the user to orally receive and send text messages through your device and cell phone and it provides ""caller ID and important battery and call status voice alerts.""Further, for Android powered devices, the user can download ""Motorola Car Finder App"" from Android Market that automatically saves and displays a map of your car's location when you turn your Roadster device off and guides you back to your car by GPS.I am so happy with the crystal clear incoming and outgoing calls that I have made with the Motorola Roadster 2 device that I bought another one for my wife's car and iphone 4S cell phone.The Sprint Store gave me twenty percent off because I purchased two of these devices; however, if I would have thought about it, I would have saved more money purchasing them through amazon.com.Enjoy!",5.0,1337731200,"05 23, 2012",Motorola Roadster 2 Universal Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone - Retail Packaging - Silver,53.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GtOoktvdL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 711},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories']]"

B007AQF0WK,A108XABRHAA9E7,YSC,"[25, 28]","This is not the first visor bluetooth speakerphone, and I thought the Jabra I had was good, until I got this. Here are some impressions:Pro:- it's loud and clear, always a plus. Picks up voice extremely well. No problems on its basic functions, and worked very well.- it has a strange (amazing, really) ability to wake up on the proximity of a cell phone, even without the bluetooth turned on. No actions needed to wake it up from sleep, yet its sleep cycle is still quite frugal on battery consumption (last weeks on normal daily use).- it also has the best bluetooth pairing and response that I have ever seen on any bluetooth device. Used it with multiple phones, and reliability has been top notch and worry free. Always connected without problems, so unlike the fidgety bluetooth that I expected (and got used to).- it has voice prompt, which further eliminated any insecurities such as connections and status. e.g. It would connect and announce the device name, and its battery level, etc.- buttons are lit when actuated/waken. It's a minor touch but a much appreciated one.- enough buttons to cover my needs--as simplicity/sleekness are often traded with functionality. The buttons are well placed that they are easy to see and  actuate.- Comes with its own micro usb car charger (that you can also use to charge your phones, headsets, etc, provided they have micro usb charging ports).- It looks and feels of good quality, and I think it is a beautiful design.Cons:- Poor FM music streaming: the feature that I most anticipated is its ability to stream a2dp bluetooth sound to FM radio. The result was not acceptable: static filled. Even if I were able to manage removing the static, the sound comes out lean and tinny. I haven't figured out why, but it is simply a non-usable feature. Quite a disappointment.- The ""car locator"" software available for android or iphone wasn't terribly useful (or reliable) for me.For my money I would probably get the slightly downgraded model without the FM streaming, as that feature is simply not working for me (tried on multiple cars). It has demonstrated more than satisfactory performance in all other principle functions, and then some nice thoughtful touches. I have come to love this, because of all the nice thoughtful details.

Here is why: Unless you buy it in the bulk option, this earpiece is much more expensive than the Oasis blue tooth, and it does nothing that the Oasis will do. I have an iPhone 4S, and the Sliver won't do much in terms of intelligent interaction: all it says is ""x min. talk time remaining"" and ""incoming call from ""number xxx"". That is it. You won't be able to talk to your iPhone with this, the feature of the ""Smart Button"" won't do a thing. It is actually the dumbest button I've ever seen, my shirt buttons are smarter than this one! I just came back from a lengthy exchange with Motorola Customer Service, and the Rep admitted that this Sliver (not the Sliver II, of which I know nothing) will not interact with the iPhone, no matter what.Their publicity on this is totally misleading, as they state that the ""Motospeak"" app will work and accomplish all these great interactive services. They don't say that this is NOT available for iPhones. If you go to the app store for iPhone, you'll see there is nothing available to enhance the Motorola Sliver.So, if you have an iPhone, stay away from the Sliver. Mine is on its way back to Amazon as I am typing this.On a different note, the bulk version also did NOT include a set of extra soft buds for the in-ear piece. It says in the description that this should be included.OK, I am revising my review, to up it from 1 to 3 stars. I would have given it 4 or 5 if they had taken their own manual more serious and not misguided users as to what's what on this ear piece!I found a way to make it work with the iPhone 4S (and it will in all likelihood work with other generations, too):  While the ""smart button"" on the stem of the device is still as dumb as I said it was (it does strictly nothing), I found by chance that the bottom button (under the thick end of the earpiece) will do all of the communication demands, not just initiate and end a call. According to the Motorola User Manual, this button cannot do anything but initiate and end calls.So, when you want to communicate with Siri, just push the bottom button once, and Siri will ask for your wishes. Well, good thing I found this! I will keep the Sliver now!I will have to see if the short stem microphone (no boom) will work as well as the longer boom on the Oasis... more about that after I practice with this Sliver for a while!",3.0,1385164800,"11 23, 2013",Motorola ELITE SLIVER HZ750 Bluetooth Headset - 89503N {bulk packaging},32.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31pOUnkrGML._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1005},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

The earpiece itself is engraved (not stenciled, but actually engraved) with a code ""RC0213"", which I thought was very strange.  After finding out the unit is DEFECTIVE, I actually went to one of the corporate stores of one of the national cell providers and bought another one.  Guess what ?  The unit was NOT engraved in any way.2.  I called Motorola and the rep immediately told me that Motorola does not engrave items in any way.  They do PRINT the Mot part #'s on some of the items such as the charger unit.  She stated that I most likely had a REFURBISHED unit, which immediately made sense.

None of these BT headsets are great in a breeze, but this thing is absolutely useless if there is even the slightest disturbance of air in the vicinity, even a barley-detectable movement from an overhead room fan that is barely turning over.The controls are impossible to manipulate as they need to be when the headset is being worn.

B007L5NKZO,A2A8IY4GTR7GWQ,Azu~Nyan,"[1, 2]","[EDIT] July 27, 2012: Alright, this does it. I am officially downgrading my rating of this headset from four stars to two stars. It may look like I am just throwing a fit, but I am re-reviewing this in a calm and collected state. The last time I used this set was 2 days ago, so there's no ""in the heat of the moment"" thing involved here.Reasons:1) Connection Issues. I am one of those people who likes to keep their headset on their ears even when the said set is not in use. So, when the headset randomly disconnects (which is once every hour on average), the voice prompt saying ""Phone 2 Disconnected, Headset not connected (1 second pause) Phone 2 Connected, Battery Level is High"" is extremely aggravating.2) I still cannot, for the life of me, figure out how to make my primary phone ""Phone_1"" instead of ""Phone_2.""3) For reasons stated in number 1, this phone seriously needs a feature to shut off the voice prompts.4) When the automated voice prompt is currently saying something, and you shut off the set through the power flip button, the voice prompt continues speaking until it's done. She wants to get her point across one way or the other.**************************[Original Review]First things first, the sound quality on this thing is awesome. Even on the max volume setting, there is little to no unnecessary background noise. In a straight line, I would say the range of this headset is about 25 meters.Off to the extras, you can use this earpiece to listen to music on your phone. It also works as an audio transmitter for your video files. There is an option to turn this feature off, but you have to do it through your phone menu every time you wish to do so. Again, the sound quality is awesome up until about 85% of the max volume. It gets worse from then on. I am just happy that I do not have to use BTmono anymore.I did have a couple of gripes with the headset. First, whatever I do, it recognizes the ""first phone"" I pair up as ""Phone_2."" Now, where is Phone_1, you say? I do not know, and neither does the headset. Instead, the next device I pair up is recognized as Phone_1. Second, on a Samsung Galaxy S2, the headset sometimes disconnects, and then reconnects immediately after. Now, I wouldn't really have a problem with that, but when the headset is still in your ear, the automatic voice prompt ""Phone 2 disconnected (2 second pause) Phone 2 connected. Battery Level is High"" can be really annoying.Another thing is that the headset features a caller ID sort of thing that tells you the number of the caller.

B007L5NKZO,A2XA8CW5DF4MNZ,"Iron Man ""JON""","[5, 6]","The Motorola HK250 Universal Bluetooth Headset is a great phone supplement for convenience and safety. It is essentially a safety supplement in terms of using your phone while driving: it frees your hand from holding your phone and enables more focus on the road compared to holding your phone in your hand or placing it on your shoulder.Impressions:The Motorola HK250 Universal Bluetooth Headset is a little smaller than other conventional bluetooth headset. It has an adjustable plastic hook that is suppose to mold to the contours of the rear of your ear but I found the hook to be a little loose fitting despite any kind of tightening that I do. Nevertheless, it is not much loose where it will fall off your ear. I was just probably used to my old headset where the adjustable plastic hook is a little thicker and more precise to the contours of my ear. Pairing it with my android phone is flawless and instantaneous, no hesitation on the part of the phone or the headset. It is enabled with voice prompts, a new feature for me, and you can place calls with voice prompts. User controls are accessible, no fumbling on where to find the volume or call/hang up button.The audio call quality is superb. While using it for the purpose of testing on both stationary and mobile platforms, I kept on constantly asking the person I was on the line with if I can be heard clearly and without static or background noise and the caller answered both in the affirmative. The call quality on my end was great too for the caller can hear me precisely and clearly.The indicated roaming range of 300 feet is a bit of an overstatement. I was first impressed when I was reading the distance specs of this headset but after on site testing, calls became staticky beyond 30 feet. Beyond 40 feet, the other party was already breaking in and out of the conversation. This testing was done in a parking lot where there was minimal trees or building. My phone was left inside the car and I kept walking away while talking to my wife. Distances were approximate but it will not take rocket science to conclude that maximum effective range to maintain legible conversation was under 30 feet. Remember, the acceptable ""standard"" range for any bluetooth device is a maximum of 33 feet. Beyond this distance, signal weakens and eventually drops.This is a bluetooth headset with stylish looks and a slight higher standard features combined with affordability. 4 stars is really pushing it.",4.0,1337040000,"05 15, 2012",Motorola HK250 Universal Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,21.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/318ybWGctdL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 419},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories', 'Computer Components']]"

Those of late seem to be getting better and better though.  A few features make this one stand out.  First is the slide on/off switch.  Forget having to hold an on/off button for 5 seconds to turn on the headset while your call goes away.  Just slide the switch and the headset turns on instantly.  The headset plays a tone to tell you it is powering up and then tells you it is connected and to which phone (1 or 2).  You can pair the headset with two different phones or devices.  It also speaks the battery level when you power it on.  When the phone rings, the headset will read the caller ID of the caller.  Unfortunately, it won't match the caller ID to the name in your phonebook and read the name but at least the caller ID is progress.  This headset will also stream audio (music, Pandora, etc.) from the phone.  Audio is crisp and clear in both directions.  It is very comfortable in the ear.No the bad part:  This headset is it has a silicone cover over the earpiece that falls off easily.  It will likely get lost in short order and they don't give you a spare.  Hopefully, one is available as a spare part.  There is a charge LED next to the micro USB charging port.  It glows red when charging and blue when fully charged.  The problem is that it is so dim, you can only see it in subdued lighting.  I guess the good news is that it won't keep you awake at night.

Though the HK250 is capable of streaming media audio, I'm not impressed by its music acoustic qualities; the feature ranks as mere gimmick on monaural devices, though I applaud the Bluetooth specification which enables it since, being a speaker it may as well play back media audio - it's convenient.My favorite thing about the HK250 is the spoken audible cues; connection status, battery level, the phone number of the incoming calls and a subtle ""double-blip"" which indicates when the call recipient picks up the line.The finish is unappealing.

First, let me say that it is a good, if not great, value. It is relatively comfortable (not as comfortable as the Oasis), especially for the design. I still have to re-adjust this, but not as often as some other brands, namely Samsung. I think if it came with different sized covers for the ear bud, it would be better, the ear bud is kind of large. Battery life is excellent and while I use it a lot, I don't have to recharge it for easily 4 days. Distance is about 12-15 feet from my phone and then it disconnects. The only thing that really keeps this from a 5 star rating is having to re-adjust it (a minor annoyance) and its maximum volume (a major annoyance). It is actually hard for me to hear people if they are not speaking loudly! If I could, I would give this 3.5 stars, but it really is better than 3 stars, so the HK250 gets the nod to 4 stars. I also like that it tells me the battery status when I turn it on. Pairing is easy (as it should be), and the charger works perfectly on my Samsung. The controls take a little getting used to but they work well and are fairly intuitive. You really don't need to read the instructions. Volume control, calling, picking up, etc., is easy....powering on and off takes some getting used (not much, but for me it's not where I would have expected it....it is on the bottom and I am not used to it there). I like the big power button! I just had to get used to it, and I did. For the price, I don't think you can find a better bluetooth headset than the HK250.....and even if you spend a bit more. This is number 2 to the Oasis.

The charge lasts a decent amount of time, although I don't really think I got the full 7.5hrs out of it that it claims to have.The device itself seems fairly well built. It is lightweight, which is good obviously for something that is going to hang off of your ear, but I do find it uncomfortable and it does not come with different silicone earpieces to enable a good fit. The piece that sits in your ear is fairly large in comparison to some other bluetooth devices.The ear wrap piece is actually clear plastic, almost looks like lucite. I feel like it would snap and break if given the chance. Alot of times I would feel like it was not situated on my ear properly, and so when I would go to adjust it, or ""stick"" it in my ear better, I'd end up hanging up the call accidentally because the whole front of the device is basically a large push button which turns the device off/ends the call. You have to be very careful how you handle/touch it when in use.All of those issues I could have dealt with on a temporary basis but the sound quality is not very great at all, which is why I would not recommend this device.Almost every single call sounds muffled or slightly distorted somehow. I never had an actual crisp and clear call. It started to give me a headache during conversations lasting longer than 5 minutes. It is almost as if everyone was talking with a blanket over their mouth or something, or as if you needed to clean out your ear.I mean, if you are desperate for something cheap to use as a temporary replacement, or if you don't need a device for everyday use, this would be an ok choice if you don't mind the poor sound quality.

Side slider button to turn the unit on/off, and on the top portion of the unit there's a micro USB jack for charging.Pairing, menu & voice commands:Using this unit was easy with user friendly voice prompts guiding every step of the way. You can pair this unit with up to two devices. You know which device you are operating based on the status light flashing blue or purple. When you first turn the unit on it instructs you on how to pair your unit.  Pairing the unit to the iPhone 4 was as simple as turning the blue tooth feature on in settings and selecting the Motorola Headset.  If you want to pair a second device just turn off the first one and turn the headset on repeat the same steps.To place a call, click the call button & wait till you get the voice command prompt from my phone. You can redial the last number by holding the call button until you hear a tone. Mute a call by holding the volume button until you hear ""mute on"" or ""mute off"". Hangup by pressing the Call/Hangup button.Volume Control & Sound Quality:Volume control is a single button on the side of the unit. It cycles through 4 levels of sound, cycling the volume up to the highest level before it will volume down, and vice verse, and using the iPhone I have 8 levels of volume.  The overall audio quality of the unit to person on the other end is similar to me using my iPhone on Speaker, from a foot or so away, though bit more tinny & cold, but not by too much, it sounds like a definite cell phone being used. It seems the sound choice was to go old fashion tinny w/no base to avoid muffled voices which is better then muffled. The iPhone normal by comparison is much warmer & natural.  The audio through the headset is clear & crisp & the volume can be made even louder then the max on the iPhone itself.Bluetooth Range:Overall the range is very good, with the unit on the main floor of my house I was able to walk anywhere in my home, from the basement to the attic without loosing reception, though it would start to sound underwater at extreme distances. The main floor to the attic is roughly the equivalent of over 20 feet & through two floors.Comfort & fit:The unit uses a single clear adjustable hook clip that goes over/around your ear holding the unit in.

Honestly I cannot say how much I talk per day, perhaps an hour all together.  Wearing it standby I have it on around six hours a day total.Voice comes through well.  And people hear me well.  Talking in wind, rain or crowds is not the best.  But then again I've yet to find one that does a great job at this, even when advertised.One warning, is if you perspire a lot, the headset will slip around. And if you are jogging it could slip off. Wiping around your ear helps or just remove the headset.The range does not come into play with me as I keep my phone with me and operate everything from my phone.I don't have any complaints on this headset.",5.0,1336867200,"05 13, 2012",Motorola HK250 Universal Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,21.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/318ybWGctdL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 419},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories', 'Computer Components']]"

It has one very hard and very large piece that fits inside the ear and one very small loop (hook) for over the ear.

Amazing keyboard, big screen, apps play wonderfully on it. Besides being very heavy, this would be a 4 or 5 star phone. However...The battery life on the Droid 4 is so terrible that I have to carry around an external battery to keep this phone charged throughout the day. Even right out of the box, the battery functioned like a phone that I had been using a year. I have only had this phone 2 months or less.I have owned the Droid X, Droid X2, Droid 2 and Droid 2 Global...so I am familiar with how terrible smartphone batteries are. The battery on this phone is the worst by far. Are you kidding me, Motorola???I was doubtful purchasing any phone with a battery that cannot be replaced. All my other smartphones, I have purchased as extended battery which increased size and weight but was worth it for better battery life. With my other phones, I didn't have to buy an extended battery until 6 months or a year of heavy use.I'm telling you, within the first week I had to look for something to keep this phone charged which is when I bought a portable battery bank that adds so much bulk that I feel like I'm using one of the Zak Morris cellphones from Saved by the Bell. Not only am I using the portable battery pack but also a task killer to kill apps not currently in use.No, I do not recommend this phone.

Amazon sellsT5 T6 Philips Slotted Screwdriver Opening Tool Set for Cell Phonefor a reasonable price, if you don't already have a T5 Torx screwdriver.  To release the back cover of the phone, so it'll slide off, you'll need to stick the end of a paper clip into the tiny hole in the upper right-corner of the phone's back while sliding the back cover downward.  Set the cover aside.Once you remove the phone's back cover, carefully peel the sticker off of the back of the battery and set it aside.  Holding the phone upright you'll find a small, soft, black rectangular insulator at the bottom right end of the battery.  Carefully lift and remove the insulator with your fingernail, which will expose two tiny screws.  That's where your T5 Torx screwdriver is needed.  Remove the two tiny screws and set them aside.In many Droid 4 phones the battery has been stuck in place with an elastic adhesive.  If your battery is stuck, carefully slide a thin plastic spudger between the battery and the phone, being very careful NOT to bend the battery.  Once you've broken the adhesive, the battery should easily lift out.  This new battery will fit into the exact same spot from which the old battery came.  Then use the tiny screws to connect the new battery through its flex cable to the phone's terminals, replace the black rectangular insulator and carefully re-apply the sticker.  Reattaching the phone's back completes the job.  Your phone should be ready to return to service with a fresh, new battery.

I'd charge my phone to full, use it for a few minutes, and suddenly get a ""50%"" warning. Time to do a replacement.And replacement isn't easy anymore. In the race to make absurdly thin devices, manufacturers have resorted to making phones designed not to be opened. I got my Razr for the awesome battery, and frankly I find it too thin for comfort, but that's another review. Long story short- pry off the back cover, use T3 and T5 bits to get all the screws out, pry off the front cover, and you can change the battery on the Maxx. Mild to medium hardware experience preferred, but not required.The battery itself is excellent, and seems to have my phone back to stock. Performance of my apps also seems radically increased now that the phone isn't going crazy trying to figure out whether it has power. The battery I got even seems a tiny bit thinner than stock- I wonder if there was a revision at some point. It seems lighter too, likely thanks to the lack of all the glue the stock battery has to try and stop you from removing it.So I got a better-than-stock replacement for the Droid Razr Maxx.

It comes with a micro-USB smart charger which is actually pretty cool if you have a Moto phone, but if they offered that separately, I would never bother purchasing this stand.  It's not all that great looking.  When using it using it as a bedside stand as I do, it stands a little higher and is angled a little more upward than I'd like.  There is no place to hold the cable, so when your phone is unplugged, you have to lay it somewhere beside the stand.  Nothing about this set up is sleek or streamlined.  I miss my old proprietary dock that I used with my Droid Bionic.  Having to find the cable, plug it in, then balance the phone on this stand seems like one step too many to do when you think about the price you're paying for it.  I would love to be able to buy this smart cable separately at a cheaper price; I have better universal stands that I can use.  As is, I'm not sure if I'd recommend this.  The cable is pretty cool and I like how the charging tip is at a 90 degree angle, but is it worth the price and this extra cumbersome stand?  I'm not sure.",3.0,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",Motorola Flip Stand with Smart Desktop Charger - Retail Packaging,50.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41jk9RTLQwL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 124617},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Cell Phone Docks']]"

On a recent trip to NY after making calls, pulling up maps, checking Yelp reviews, etc my phone went dead in record time (and of course in the middle of a call). Having charged my Motorola battery pack the previous night, I was quickly able to connect again to the world. The built in cord connected phone and battery pack in just seconds. The phone was a little more cumbersome to use with the pack attached, but it was certainly preferable to no phone at all. Interestingly, the pack proved to increase the amount of time available by a multiple of 3 compared to my phone's stock battery. Back at the hotel I left the 2 devices connected and plugged in only the battery pack to the wall outlet. I was able to charge both devices at once even while periodically using the phone. Besides the phone, I've since used the pack to power / charge my Kindle Fire when it went dead while out and about. For me, the key has been getting in the habit of charging up the pack daily as I do my phone. With a not supplied mini USB to regular USB connection cord, I can also charge the pack from my laptop.

B0099SFGF8,A18U05IGMK1FVV,Alvin English,"[1, 2]","Going into this purchase, I suspected the weakest link would be the FM transmission between the Roadster 2 and my car's stereo system.  Since Motorola pioneered radio and two-way communication, my hopes were very high.  I only invested a day determining the usability of the Roadster 2.On the plus side, pairing two android devices to the Roadster 2 was very easy.  The speaker on the Roadster 2 is very good considering the small size.  The Roadster 2 recognizes the names of the contacts then calls the correct phone number when selecting address entries by voice command.  The buttons are large and easily identified - consider it user friendly.  The best way to use this product is with the built in speaker.  It functions very better on it's own.On the negative side, FM transmission to the car's radio fluctuates, it is sometimes very good and other times very bad.  An FM channel that is clear initially may have static a few blocks down the road as you approach a stronger competing FM radio signal.  When streaming music to the FM radio the audio quality will not approach that of a factory installed integrated hands-free system.  The only flaw in this product is the use of the FM frequency for transmitting to the car stereo.  The Roadster 2 scans for strongest available channels which is exactly what it should not do - duh.  It should look for unused channels!  The best way to use this product is with the built in speaker which is clearer.Heck, I can get better sound quality by connecting the phone via standard audio cable which by the way works great for speaking on the phone too.  But, taking the audio cable approach, I still have to fumble with the cellphone buttons and that is dangerous while driving.If you do a lot of talking while driving, the Roadster 2 is safer than using the cellphone alone.  The Roadster 2's built in speaker is very clear and the buttons are easy to find.  The Roadster 2 provides easy to access buttons and vocal commands.  It is a useable product when not going through the FM car radio.  This product can not be compared to the integrated hands-free bluetooth radio systems that come installed on vehicles, today.  But, for the price it is as good or better than other FM frequency products.  I have paid a lot more for Bluetooth earpieces that do not have anywhere near functionality of this speakerphone.Bottom line:  If you are looking for a dedicated car speakerphone that supports voice commands, has a user friendly interface, and you are not concerned about a high quality stereo connection the Roadster 2 is a good choice.  I have come to the conclusion the FM frequency is always the weakest link.  The commercial FM radio broad cast signals are too strong.  The Roadster 2 seems to look for the channels used by the commercial stations.

When used in landscape-mode, the sign-in password screen is reduced to 1/3 of the screen size, and nothing else takes the rest of the screen?  This makes it very-hard to input the password!!!  Overall harder to use this way.4.  Suction cup arm too short, for most cars (long dash/ windows).5.  Does not come with power cord (luckily no ugly blinding-blue Big-M, charger).6.  Seems to get stuck in car-dock-only-mode (cant use normal home screen, or apps)? If I used back arrow, it return to the normal home screen sometimes. But then, I'm stuck using back arrow in order to get to the main home screen, that you would normally use when it out of the dock).  The Razr' Software is unfinished for dock use...7.  Dock latch/lock interferes with the volume adjustment (too close).8.  My windshield is too far away for a suction mount, unless, I place it somewhere not legal in most states.  So I use the dock attached to a home made flat surface mount-in my car, that has worked with the two prior generations of Droid phones, as well as my P8767 flip phone (best phone ever - sound-wise).  I'm going to have to buy an aftermarket mount, to make it work correctly (I glued the supplied permanent mount, to the suction mount and then cut the sides off, to make a more square-ish mount, to fit my application).Notes:-- If the phone dont fit, try one of the 2 different adapters, that are included (assuming you have the Razr MAXX HD, and the correct dock)...#  My car stereo audio input connector, is less than one foot away from the phone.  I use this for both my music player audio (sound) and phone call sound.  Works well using the 2.5mm headphone jack.  Not so well with the SKN part (% See below for more info).  BT is over kill for this use.  I made a cord that brakes out the extra external mic that's part of the 2.5mm head phone jack.  And this works the best.  But I dont think the SKN-- cord supports this (TBD).Bottom line:--  Its broken...",2.0,1369440000,"05 25, 2013",Motorola HD Vehicle Navigation Dock for Motorola DROID RAZR HD/RAZR MAXX HD - Retail Packaging,49.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41lWfYZ4OoL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 35881},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Car Accessories', 'Car Cradles & Mounts', 'Car Mounts']]"

A big improvement over my Droid X when I always had to pop the case off and was continually stressing the case to crack in the process.

Pulling off the road to dictate text may be easier but I like that it will read me any text received and I can safely continue driving as if I was listening to the radio.  I find it easier to insert the charger, easy to assemble/disassemble when I want to pack it for air travel and ready to use in the rental car.

My previous vehicle dock had too many adjustable angles that made setup more frustrating than it needed to be. This has a simple ball and socket design that permits plenty of angles for any setup.  It is also nice that the charging cord plugs into the dock itself instead of directly into the phone. Now you don't have to fiddle with the cord each and every time you place or remove the phone.As per previous versions, the phone detects the dock on insert - along with the SMART Actions app, you have a wide range of control over what happens then (volume adjustments, gps on, wifi off, screen up, auto-reply texts, etc, etc). Nice accessory that adds a good amount of functionality specific to driving - a little expensive on its own, but a great deal when you look at the price of stand alone 5 inch GPS units.Does not come with a charger (nice, since I already have several) but does come with a head-phone to head-phone cable so you can plug into some car stereos directly. Also has setup for both windshield and dashboard mounting.Comes with custom fit pieces that allow for snug fit on both the RAZR HD and RAZR MAXX HD including with or without a protective case. That's right, you can have a protective case on the larger MAXX and it will still fit in this dock.Update 12/3/12: I finally received the Otterbox Commuter after a terrible experience with Otterbox - I'll save that for a different review. The case DOES NOT quite fit in the dock as intended. However, the phone does slide in nicely with only the inner soft skin from the Otterbox case. This would indicate that less robust cases and skins would actually work. If anyone has tried other protective cases I propose we list them in the comments section. Sorry for the delayed update here.Update 11/26/12:  I noticed one of the other reviews describes a problem with using the phone as a dashcam. I've taken a couple videos from the dock and none of the frame is blocked for me (I have it mounted to the windshield in this case).

B009M27MB2,AIFLY2HF8NS8U,Andre Lawrence,"[32, 40]","About a month ago, Jaybird released what I thought to be the best new sports Bluetooth headset this season: Jaybird Freedom Spirit.***  ***Jabra (""Sport""), at this point, was perhaps on the cutting edge with their wireless, sport-bluetooth headsets coupled with Endomondo's sports tracker app, a better than average microphone and a reasonable price was difficult to overlook.Motorola (""SF600"") had a better speaker system and a more secure fit than the Jabra Sport, but trailed very slightly with battery life.Other companies, like Sony, with their ""XBA-BT75"" offered a marginally better sound, but sacrificed fit, microphone and a decent battery life for a premium price.Jaybird's Freedom Spirit gave you two ways to fit the headphones.  Both are extremely comfortable.  The microphone and speaker are above average, but whose battery life and re-charge time and annoying button arrangement really took away from a headset that had solved many of the issues of previous season models.***  ***The two areas where Jaybird is deficient in--battery and design--is NOT an issue with this new Motorola ""S11.""It seems as if Motorola heard the legitimate criticisms about the headphones released across the board last year and made some very noticeable improvements over their ""SF600"" model.First, the earphones are just as snug but the earpiece is a little more flexible.  I especially liked how they wrapped around the head.  (When you first take them out, you notice a bit of a weight to them.  But you'll soon forget that when you put them on.)The battery life is a shade under 6 hours.  6 hours of any of the following: talking, listening to music, watching a movie on a Bluetooth-enabled device.  And, the headphone will chime and tell you how much battery life is left--something that the $300 Sony's don't do.The microphone issue is clear.  There is NO sports Bluetooth headset with as loud of a microphone system as these S11.  Period.  They blare when a call comes in.  I was told, during a 2-mile walk back home that I was walking next to a noisy crowd and yet the nearest people (a couple and their child were putting grocery in their trunk) were about 15-20 feet away.  When I got home, I gave the lady my phone and headset and I grabbed my business phone and had her to call me on it as we walked outside of the house in different directions.  I had to hold the phone away from my ears--and it wasn't on speakerphone.  It's unreal.The battery recharged in less than 60 minutes after being completely drained.Streaming music and music sitting on my microSD card in my Android phone sounded crisp, very little distortion.*** Comparing the new Motorola to Amazon's best-selling wireless, sports headsets ****** Sound fidelity/ Call reception ***Motorola ""S11"" (Nov. 2012)-- ExcellentJaybird ""Freedom Sprint"" (Nov. 2012)--ExcellentSony ""XBA-BT75""--ExcellentMotorola ""SF600""--Very GoodJabra ""Sport"" -Good*** Comfort ***Motorola ""S11"" - very comfortableMotorola ""SF600""--very comfortableJaybird--Very comfortableJabra--ComfortableSony--uncomfortable*** Cost ***Jabra-- $75Motorola ""SF600""-- $90Jaybird-- $130Motorola-- $130Sony-- $298*** Battery life ***Jaybird--3 hoursJabra--3.75 hoursMotorola ""SF600""--4 hoursSony--4 hoursMotorola ""S11""--5.75 hours*** Conclusion ***Now has never been a better time to buy a wireless, Bluetooth headset.  The sound reproduction has improved dramatically over the past 2 years and the cost has dropped significantly.  For the cost of replacing a couple of moderate-priced good, wired headsets, you could have a decent wireless Bluetooth headset.At this point, the best overall is the Motorola ""S11"" followed by the Jaybird.  The Jabra's, although about a year old, is still a very good buy.  I love the snug feeling and the great speaker system in the ""SF600"" but for a few dollars more, I'd recommend the ""S11"" over them.  I wouldn't recommend the Sony's under any circumstance.If the battery life and recharging cycle and the button design on the Jaybird were different, it would be very difficult to recommend the Jaybird over the ""S11"" or vice versa.Motorola ""S11""--4.5 stars.",5.0,1353974400,"11 27, 2012",Motorola S11-Flex HD Wireless Stereo Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/White,83.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31QNQykR-0L._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1207},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories', 'Computer Components']]"
B009M27MB2,A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E,"Archie Mercer ""Archie""","[0, 0]","Back in January 2012 I started using theMotorola SF600 Wireless Sports Headphones - Retail Packaging - Blackfor my daily workouts and casual ""walking-the-dog"" jaunts. At the time I found it to be a product that provided great sound and convenience without the pesky wires hanging down and getting in the way. Over the year I became slightly less enamored as the ear piece had a propensity to slip a bit out of the ear. It never fell out completely but enough to be annoying. So with that in mind I decided to try the new Motorola S11-Flex HD Wireless Stereo Bluetooth Headset since it claimed to eliminate that.First off, yes the earpiece stays firmly in place. In fact, very firmly in place. It does not budge at all. This is due to the connecting part being a firm yet kind of flexible piece of plastic instead of a loose wire like the SF600 has. The sound is awesome and in my opinion even better than the SF600. And like the SF600 it is extremely easy to set up. It takes about five seconds after charging and you are off and running.However the fix Motorola used to keep the earpiece in place is itself a bit annoying. The plastic piece fits around the back of your head and is extremely snug. In my case it actually pushes the earpiece into your ears making it a bit uncomfortable. Plus there is no way to adjust where that plastic band rests on your head. If I had my preference I would have it a bit higher so that it rests across the bottom of my baseball cap I wear when working out but that pushes the earpiece out of the ears, defeating the purpose. If Motorola came out with a version that allowed a bit of flexibility in that aspect I would be all over it.Overall I would recommend this as a good and convenient wireless headset.

You can even adjust the quality a bit using the built-in equalize to select among presets to emphasize bass, treble, voice, everything (not sure what that means), or nothing.- The fit is secure and comfortable.  You get four different sizes and the way this headset is designed, the selection isn't to keep the eargels stuck in your ears, that's taken care of by a slight and unnoticeable pressure provided by the rest of the headset.  The only thing the eargels have to do is seal against the sides of your ears to seal out noise.  Even picking the ""wrong"" size works well and you'll find one size that is particularly effective at sealing out most noises.- Controls are straight forward and easy to use.  There is one button to turn the headset on and off, a pair of buttons for volume up and down, and a fourth button for everything else.  The ""everything else"" button is the only one that needs explanation, though not a lot.  Press and release to pause the current song (and answer a call).  Press twice to skip forward.  Three times and you skip backward.  Hold it while a song is playing to stop through the equalizer settings.  Each setting is described with voice prompts.- I can send voice commands to my iPhone using the undocumented SECRET BUTTON SEQUENCE: Tap the everything button, as if to pause a song, and then hold it for two seconds to activate voice recognition on your device.  At least that's that happens with my iPhone.- I can see the headset battery level on my iPhone.  The headset also tells me, in English, how many hours of charge are left in the battery.  Speaking of iPhones, you also get an indication on the phone display of headphone battery level.- The signal reception is outstanding.  I've recently tried earbuds where it mattered which pocket I had my phone.  With these the phone can be in a different room... a different floor for that matter.- Calls made with this headset are at least as good any any of the dozen other headsets I've tried.What I didn't like:- I can't thing of a single thing.",5.0,1353542400,"11 22, 2012",Motorola S11-Flex HD Wireless Stereo Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/White,83.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31QNQykR-0L._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1207},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories', 'Computer Components']]"

B009M27MB2,A2DG63DN704LOI,ESlaydog,"[16, 20]","This is a fantastic set of headphones. Out of the box they feel well-made and are definitely durably built. The sound quality is remarkable. Pairing them with my iPhone was simple, and made even smoother by the fact that when you press the pair button a woman speaks into the headset telling you the exact steps you need to take to get going.I am a runner and this is the main way I plan on using the set. I did my first run with them this morning and while I continue to be impressed with the best-in-class sound quality, I felt like the fit was less than perfect. As I ran, the headphones bounced around a bit on my head and it was a tad distracting as this bouncing (which sounded a lot like a heartbeat in my ears) took away from the aforementioned sound quality. In their defense, they are highly adjustable and do fit snugly. All in all, I'm still not entirely sold on wearing ear buds (vs. headphones) as I run. Tomorrow I plan on using the different sized earpieces (included) to see if I can eliminate or minimize the bouncing sound.If you plan on using these for activities with less movement, or on a plane, I'd definitely give them 5 stars. For running, I'm going to deduct one. If different earpieces make it better, I will report back.12/5/12 UPDATE: (changed rating to 5*)Today for my run I added the adjustment bar to the headphones (which I should have done before but somehow missed it). I have a huge head and typically on my baseball hats I have to use one of the last (biggest) settings on the adjustment strips in the back. On the adjustment for this headphone, I used the first (smallest) strap and once I did this it killed the aforementioned ""heartbeat"" sound but then I heard a new ticking sound as I ran. The sound wasn't in the headphones themselves, but rather a bumping of something (not sure what) as I ran.So, during my run, I made it my goal to get these things to fit perfectly, which lead to a very choppy start/stop run. The good news is that I perfected the fit and no longer hear any sounds as I run. The main thing I learned is that you don't need to have those ear-buds pushed into your ear-holes. Perhaps this is common knowledge, but I've always worn them this way in the past. Because these headphones have enough adjustments on them that they are able to stay put on your head, you can just press them towards your ear-hole without shoving it in. It took me several miles and adjustments to finally get to this conclusion, but once I did there was no noise/bounce/ticks, etc. at all and the rest of my run was fantastic and I was able to enjoy the clear sound and great Bluetooth connection.So, after this ""adjustment period"" I've got a different understanding about how to wear this device and I am 100% thrilled to be running with this set and have moved my rating from 4 stars to 5.If you found this review useful or have any questions, just let me know!

B009M27MB2,A2XA8CW5DF4MNZ,"Iron Man ""JON""","[7, 10]","The Motorola S11-Flex HD Wireless Stereo Bluetooth Headset puts a different take on what you should expect on a BT headset. It has so far exceeded my expectations as far as audio, fit, range and ruggedness I so desperately wished for in a BT headset. I've had similarly designed BT headsets before, an Altec Lansing Backbeat 906 and an LG Tone HBS-700, to which I will be making my head to head comparison. The Motorola S11-Flex HD Wireless Stereo Bluetooth Headset surpasses both the Altec Lansing and LG in just about all the categories I could think of in a BT headset.My impressions:Fit: the Motorola S11-Flex HD, as with the other 2 brands I am comparing it with, is an in-ear headset but like the Altec Lansing Backbeat, it has a wrap around bar that goes over behind your neck for stability. Unlike the Backbeat, the S11-Flex's wrap around bar is adjustable. It can be adjusted to the contours of your head assuring of a fit that stays and will not fall off, even when you are engaged in a full motion workout or you are running. It simply stays put allowing you to enjoy whatever you are listening to without the constant motion of adjusting it or putting it back on when it goes out of place. It comes with 4 different sized ear buds so you can get the best fit in your ear regardless of the size of the holes of your ear. I must also mention that the fit is very comfortable. I used it for workout lasting a couple of hours and I had no issues with comfort at all.Audio: the audio of the the Motorola S11-Flex HD was surprisingly very good, way lot better than the Altec Lansing or LG headphones that I am comparing this with. For one, the S11-Flex HD outputs audio evenly spread on the sound spectrum. Listening to music provides a balanced bass and treble, no overly broken highs or lows even if you desire to have the volume a little higher than usual. The LG Tone fails miserable in this department, once you turn the volume up, distortion is the name of the game as far as your music listening pleasure is concerned. This is the first BT headset that I had the chance to own with an Equalizer functionality. You can set your headset to an equalizer setting that best suits the music you are playing. The phone call aspect of the S-11 Flex is great too. I am able to listen to my call and my callers heard me clearly without any kind of background interference. This proved especially true using it when the car windows were rolled down, the noise-cancelling was great and we were able to maintain a clear conversation despite the wind noise.Connectivity: I had no problems connecting the S11-Flex with my android phone and my ipod touch. I have 2 android phones, one with a 4.0 Ice cream Sandwich OS and the other a 2.3 Gingerbread OS and the S11-Flex connected without any issues. I was also able to connect this with a 2nd Generation ipod touch without any problems at all.Range: the S-11 Flex boasts a range of 150 feet from your connected device. This is quite an overkill as far as the specified range is concerned. I tried this out on the parking lot of a local grocery store, left my phone in the car and started to walk away. Things started to have some distortion from 40 feet out. At approximately 70 feet, the audio was quitting in and out. So I'd say the stated 150 feet range is an overkill. I had no problems roaming around the house with it. Depending on the size/area of your home, you rarely venture to more than 50 feet in any part of your house. If you do, would be wise to have your device with you and use the BT headset at the same time.Ruggedness: the ability of the S11-Flex to withstand moisture and sweat is an added plus especially when using it while exercising. Sweat is acidic and anything that comes into contact with sweat, degrades over time.Overall, the Motorola S11-Flex HD Bluetooth Headset is a great performing headset to have. The functionality and ruggedness of the S11 surpasses other headsets in the same category.

B009M27MB2,A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K,"Jared Castle ""Oregon writer""","[3, 4]","The HD sound is fine. The Bluetooth connection works well enough. The headphones are somewhat adaptable to provide a good fit that stays in play while running. If that's all you are looking for, then these headphones might work for you. On the other hand, if comfort and ease of use are issues, then you'd be better off stringing together two paper cups.Let's start with comfort. The earpieces for the Motorola S11-Flex headphones fit inside the ears. While I appreciated that Motorola provide various-sized earpiece shells for the user to try, I was unable to find a comfortable selection. In fact, these are the least comfortable earpieces that I have ever tried.Ease of use is not much better. The low-profile controls (e.g. power, volume) are built into the outer shell of the headphones, making it very difficult to find these buttons with my fingers while wearing the headset...even when knowing their locations. The buttons are small and their profiles are simply too small to easily operate. Even with the headset off, it is somewhat difficult to find the buttons.These limitations are simply not acceptable.Rating: One star.DISCLOSURE: This review is courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, which provides products at no cost in exchange for my independent and unbiased feedback.

All of them had their quirks and some had great audio but would constantly cut out.

These headphones meet all of those requirements. These are the perfect headphones for distance runners.

B009M27MB2,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,J. B. Hoyos,"[0, 0]","I kept hoping and praying that I would eventually find a comfortable wireless headset that I could wear indoors and outdoors and experience great reception.  Thanks to the generosity of the Amazon Vine Program, I finally found one in the Motorola S11-Flex HD Wireless Stereo Bluetooth Headset.  It arrived neatly packaged in a box that can be reused for storing the headset, including its instruction booklet.  The instructions are easy to follow but difficult to read without a magnifying glass.Pairing the wireless headset with my Apple iPhone 4 was extremely easy.  I didn't have to type in a code or password.  An electronic voice told me when it was paired.  Now, whenever I power on my headset, my iPhone automatically connects to it.  The headset is extremely comfortable to wear.  No longer do I have an elastic strap that becomes stuck to my neck when I walk and causes the earbuds to be pulled out of my ears when I suddenly turn my head to the right or left.  I can dance as hard as I want (gyrating, twisting and thrashing my body) and don't have to worry about the earbuds becoming dislodged.  The reception, most importantly, is awesome, both indoors and outdoors.I can speed walk, jog or run and the music is always clear and sharp, unlike my other wireless headsets/headphones where the music played as though it came from a broken record:  stalling, sputtering, hiccupping, etc.  The headset's controls (i.e., power on, power off, volume increase, volume decrease, etc.) were easy to operate.  However, it was difficult to return to a previous song track.  One has to push the MFB (multifunction button) three times.  It seldom worked.  However, this is fine.  It seldom worked for any of my other wired/wireless headsets/headphones.  Charging the Motorola headset was also easy.  It charges in only a few hours.  I greatly appreciate Motorola providing an AC power adapter.  I can charge it with an ordinary electrical outlet in the wall.  I don't have to use a micro USB cable and plug it into my PC or my Philips SPS6038A/17 Home Charging Station (Philips SPS6038A/17 Home Charging Station).  I wish all of my wireless headsets/headphones came with AC power adapters.Not only is the reception great for the Motorola headset but it remains paired with my iPhone for great distances.  In my apartment, I can set my iPhone in the stairwell and walk to the farthermost corner, which is over sixty feet away, and still hear the music clearly.  This is awesome.  I have worn my headset to work, church, the mall, the grocery store and to the club house at my apartment complex.  I love wearing it when I'm using the elliptical machine, which has a docking station for my iPhone.  I am able to watch movies (that I have downloaded to my iPhone) on a screen and hear them with my headset.  Thanks to my iPhone and my Motorola headset, working out is more fun!  This headset is highly recommended for physically active individuals who love listening to music.I have enjoyed using my Motorola headset so much that I recently acquired the Otterbox Motorola S11 Flex HD Headphone Case (Otterbox Motorola S11 Flex HD Headphone Case - Black) for protecting it against breakage.  Many reviewers have complained that the flexible headband broke after the passage of time.  Keeping this in mind, I will carefully handle my headset, trying to prevent it from dropping long distances onto hard surfaces, and will keep it stored in my Otterbox.  Another problem I foresee in the future is the loss or tearing of the silicone earbuds.  However, replacement earbuds (Bluecell 10 Pairs Medium Silicone Replacement Ear Buds Tips  - Black) can be ordered from Amazon.  The Bluecell earbuds work great.  They are just like the ones you receive with many electronic devices.Joseph B.

I found that the S10's, if I left them on for more than 30 minutes, would hurt my ears alot.  The new S11-Flex does not hurt my ears at all, even after 1.5 hours of use.  I do think my S10's have a slightly better sound, but that could be due to how tight they fit my ears.  They also seem slightly lighter than the S10 headphones but that could also be me being more comfortable.  Battery seems to last awhile.  I do not like the button placement though, I find I push the wrong button all the time when I am trying to run and change a song, I end up making a call instead.  I'm sure its just me needing to practice, but it would be nice to only answer calls with my phone and change music with the headphones.  Overall, I like these alot better than others I have tried.

B009M27MB2,A1ZU55TM45Y2R8,J. Haggard,"[0, 0]","UPDATED -- 9 months laterSo I've been using these for nearly 9 months off and on. Typically when mowing the yard or kayaking on the lake. After about 9 months the rubber head band on the back broke, and shortly after the actual headband itself cracked in half. It still works, but it really isn't healthy. Did I get $100+ use out of it? I would say no, I really liked using them on the kayak and wished they help up, but after 9 months it broke, I kayak about once a week so I used it 36 times, plus add some lawn mowing so probably 50 times in 9 months before they broke, that's about a $2 per use cost. Not bad, but not worth me buying another set. I'd recommend you pass on these until they are able to make the bands stronger. Changing my star rating from 4 to 3.---------BELOW IS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW----------I like products where you use them and they fit every need you have right away. This comes close.First when I opened the package of this I was happy with the construction. These feel strong, not cheap.I liked when I turned them on it told me the estimated time remaining for the battery level, NICE!I liked that it paired really easily to my android phone.I liked the sound quality when making phone callsI liked the volume level of music even while hiking.What I didn't like...I started with this saying an estimate of 6 hours battery life. I spent 2 hours hiking listening to music. I hit the power button or so I thought. The next day I was going to use these again while cleaning up my garage and getting ready to move. I didn't want a stereo blasting as I was moving room to room... I put these on, hit the power button and nothing, apparently I either didn't turn it off even though it chimed like I thought it did or the battery died even though there was no longer a device connected... Seems like this should have an auto off if no device is connected after X amount of time... I don't understand how or why the battery died so quickly between uses.Other then that little issue, these fit good, they stay on and don't get in your way. I do like them. I just wish I could understand this battery issue better.Side note for Motorola, it would be slick (might not be practical) if these had a strip of solar panel around the band so that as you wore them they would keep charging in the sun. :)",3.0,1354060800,"11 28, 2012",Motorola S11-Flex HD Wireless Stereo Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/White,83.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31QNQykR-0L._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1207},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories', 'Computer Components']]"

B009M27MB2,A34CSXOGVYF94S,"Joel Avrunin ""Electrical Engineer who loves S...","[206, 223]","I've become a common evaluator of headphones for Amazon, having evaluated quite a few high quality over the ear headphones, in-the-ear bud-style products, and also lots of single-ear bluetooth earpieces.  This is my first bluetooth wrap-around style headphone review.  Overall I am impressed, but I have a few reservations.COMFORTMost important for this class of headphones is comfort and fit.  These are behind the head style headphones that are designed to stay in even during strenuous activity.  They come with 4 different ear bud silicone inserts, but I found the ones already installed worked just fine (there are 2 smaller options a 1 bigger one over the ones installed).  The headphones form a nice seal inside the ears that doesn't feel too tight and stayed put.  Behind the head, the headphones were a little large, but there is an additional adjustable band you can install that reduces the size quite well.  Even on my larger head the headphones stayed put.  The individual buds also pivoted to adjust to exact head shape.How well did they stay put?  I decided to do a Beach Body P90X Cardio workout including Yoga and they stayed put the entire time.  Of course, they started to get a bit uncomfortable as I sweated, but it's to be expected.  The point is that they did not move despite doing floor exercises and jumping jacks.SOUNDJust as I would expect, they sound great and well balanced.  Not too hard on the bass, not too hard on the treble.  Hard rock for workouts, classical for relaxing - it all sounded great to me.  Immersive sound while outside noises were completely blocked.  I'd say my Audio Technica's or my Monster headphones with large pads are likely better sounding and fuller, but those are wired headphones with thick pads that are certainly not designed for workouts.INTERFACEThe headphones arrived partially charged (a soothing voice told me they have 4 hours of charge).  They were incredibly simple to use.  I turned them on and had them paired with my iPhone in no time.  The right ear features the power switch and volume control while the left ear has the multi-function button.  The right ear also has the LED status light and a rubber-grommeted micro-USB port for charging.  Thanks Motorola for using a standard charging port!  The package includes a wall-wart micro-USB charger as well.The place the interface suffers is in the multi-plexed switch.  Push once to pause, twice to skip forward, three times to skip back.  The instruction manual has a dozen phone features that can be activated, but you will need the manual to figure it out.  It worked, but with so much space, couldn't we get more intuitive controls and a few more buttons?BLUETOOTH RANGEUnbelievably long.  I use a Plantronics Legend with my phone and it will lose signal after a short distance.  But with the S11-Flex HD, I can put my iPhone 4 in one corner of my house and walk to the other corner of the other floor and still get great sound.  Truly impressive bluetooth range.TELEPHONE CALLSNo problem here - I made a call and the microphone picked up my voice quite well.  I was enjoying my music during a run and was able to easily take a call without missing a beat.  Noise cancellation isn't great like a dedicated headset, but for switching to a phone call without removing the headset, it works very well.BLUETOOTH FUNCTIONALITYSadly, here is where the headphones lose a star.  First, I noticed that the volume switch on the headphones doesn't send a signal to the phone to change the volume (as my Plantronics devices do), but rather changes the volume of the headset.  So if the phone volume is set low it can be impossible to get it turned up high enough using just the headset controls.  Other bluetooth headphones I have owned send the signal to the phone to change the volume.I was also disappointed that multipoint didn't work.  My Plantronics Legend is paired to both my iPhone 4 and iPad 3, both running iOS 6.0.1.  I routinely switch back and forth between them, so I know how it should work.  The Motorola paired successfully to the iPhone 4, but when I tried to pair it to the iPad, the screen said pairing was ""unsuccessful"", but then it showed as connected in Settings.  I had never seen that before.  Sure enough, the audio prompts in the headset said it was connected to 2 devices, but the iPad never recognized it.Switching the order, I deleted it from both devices, paired it to the iPad first and then the iPhone.  The iPad then worked fine, but when I paired to the iPhone, I got the same ""unsuccessful"" message.Sadly, I must report that at least for the iPhone/iPad, I could not get it to switch back and forth, even though the headset thinks it is paired to both.CONCLUSIONMotorola has done a nice job with the form factor and audio quality here.  The range is truly impressive, and the ability to keep up with the activity of P90X was truly impressive.  These would be 5 star headphones, but the clunky multiplexed interface combined with the malfunctioning multipoint force me to detract a star.  If you don't absolutely need multipoint, I recommend these headphones.UPDATE September 2013:When I wrote this review, I wasn't into running yet.  I got into running about 8 months ago, and found this headset to be amazing for my runs.  It stays put on my head and doesn't slip around.  I love having it bluetooth-paired to my iPod Nano so I can listen to music while running.  I do wish there was another switch to switch tracks though.  The multifunction switch requires you to ""double click"" to skip a song, which isn't always easy while running.  I also run with my iPhone and if someone calls, I am able to take the call with this headset, another nice feature.I did want to note one thing.  The bendy white plastic back of the headset started to develop cracks last month.  I could still get it on my head, but it did not hold tight.  A few other reviewers had the same issue.  I called Motorola to complain, and they replaced the headset when I explained which part broke.  It appears that this is a known issue with early models of the headset.  The new one they sent looks a bit different - both control buttons are orange (on the old one, one was orange the other was black).  I have had no issue with cracking since I got the new one.A good accessory to consider as well isOtterbox Motorola S11 Flex HD Headphone Case - Blackto protect these headphones in a gym bag.",4.0,1353110400,"11 17, 2012",Motorola S11-Flex HD Wireless Stereo Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/White,83.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31QNQykR-0L._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1207},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories', 'Computer Components']]"

B009M27MB2,AQMUXDDCLJSSV,J. Peplinski,"[0, 0]","I've tried a few different wireless bluetooth headsets before this one, including theJaybird Sportsband Stereo Bluetooth Headphone - Bulk Packaging - Runners Redand theLG Tone Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange.  Overall, I think this is my favorite one, especially for when working out.  However, it isn't perfect.SOUND QUALITY:  Excellent.  Excellent when properly positioned, I should say.  Full sound - very loud.  I can hear it easily while running on a loud treadmill.  Unfortunately, after I've been sweating a lot, I have to make some adjustments to get the earbuds to get seated right.  I end up losing some of the bass unless they are seated just right.WEAR AND FIT: The process of putting these on does take some getting used to.  Don't give up, though.  Try it with the adjustable band, try all the different ear bud sizes.  I did and was eventually able to get it just right .  It sort of takes two hands and I had to push the top of my earlobe through the loop until I really got used to it.  Keep in mind, the band goes behind your head, not over your head.  However, I was able to lay my head back on a weight bench and it didn't get jostled or moved around at all.  Depending on your frames, if you wear glasses, it may be uncomfortable to wear these with glasses.  The area behind the ear can get crowded with your glasses and the back of the device there.  However, I am typically wearing contacts when working out, which is when I'm typically wearing these.PAIRING: I paired mine with two devices at once very easily and simply, a Droid Razr and an iPad.  It was much easier than other bluetooth phone headsets that I've used that pairs with two devices.  Here's the thing - it does depend on what you are using and which gets paired first.  I paired with the iPad first and then the Razr.  The iPad's sound/media was coming through the headset.  The Razr was able to handle the phone calls, but I was not able to play music off my phone.  When I paired with the phone first and the iPad second, I got the phone audio and the media from the Razr, but I got nothing from the iPad.  This really isn't a big deal to me.  I like that you can pair with two devices, but you have to be aware, that sometimes, you may be in a situation where just because both devices are paired, you may still need to disconnect one.PHONE CALL QUALITY:  This is much better than the Jaybird Sportband I mentioned above and about the same as the LG Tone, but still not the same as just talking on the phone.  It will get the job done, but you probably don't want to wear this headset all day or in the car while you are taking long phone calls.  Use a bluetooth device designed for phone calls.  This is more of a headphone headset, not a phone calling headset.PAIRING: I paired mine with two devices at once very easily and simply, a Droid Razr and an iPad.

It also takes the same mini-USB connector to charge as most other devices do these days.  Those Jaybird ones I tried had a special one that only works with that.  The fewer single use cords I have around the house the better.  Another thing is that I would prefer a track forward and track backward button.  Instead, it uses one button - press once for pause, twice for forward, three times for backward.PROS:GREAT sound and decent  bassDoesn't short out even with lots of sweatQuick pairingQuick ChargingVoice tells how many hours remaining on batteryPairs with multiple devicesCONS:Putting them on takes some getting used toCan be difficult to wear while wearing glassesCan easily slip out of place when sweating, requiring adjustmentsNo separate forward/backward track buttonsPairs with one device for calls and one for media, depending on the order",4.0,1355875200,"12 19, 2012",Motorola S11-Flex HD Wireless Stereo Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/White,83.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31QNQykR-0L._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1207},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories', 'Computer Components']]"

I haven't had a ton of experience with Motorola products (aside from one pair of sport headphones I used last year) but my friend (an avid jogger) kept hassling me about trying these bad boys out for my 4 mile runs. I normally go back and forth between using my trusty Sennheiser P90X, my Sony  XBA-BT75 Armature bluetooth headset, Jaybird Freedom Set Bluetooth set and my Jabra Sport set. I love them all. I am normally not too picky between any of them since they all work great for what I need them for.The biggest perk to these would be the wireless factor. Wires become really annoying if you are a runner or jogger and the fact that these are cord-free is WONDERFUL!Second to that, the sound quality is stunning. Every song I have listened to is crisp, clear and pitch-perfect. This is a huge incentive for me and a rarity for wireless technology. I have found that wired headsets normally have a more pristine sound quality but these are outstanding. I have loved using these on my jogs and they seem to really cancel all other noises that could otherwise interfere from my experience.The battery on these suckers is fantastic as well. I have gotten around 4.5 or so hours of continual use without having to recharge them. That's a big perk. My phone doesn't even seem to last that long on continuous use!!! Amazing!!Phone call quality with these could be better but I am blaming that on my location. I have pretty bad service where I live and especially where I usually use these and hardly ever have problem-free calls. That said, these are great in areas where my sprint service has more towers and less interference. The incoming calls sound good. Not great...but good. I love that the headset informs you of incoming calls, messages and texts via a female voice.Navigation to switch over from music to calls is easy via convenient placement of function buttons on the headset. It only took me a few minutes to familiarize myself with the buttons and once that was done it was smooth sailing for me.Finally, the fit. I love the fit of these. They actually fit me great straight out of the box. I barely had to adjust them! If you need to do that though they slide  and move for more space. Very convenient and consumer friendly!Overall, I am in LOVE with these. Great wire-free headset with bluetooth!

Would it have killed the designers to include some metal reinforcement there? I was not using the product in any rough manner, certainly not on any marathons. Any product intended to be flexed, repeatedly, should be designed for that. This product is designed for tiny-necked people who will never stress that part of the product.Five stars for sound quality and BT reception, 1 star for horrible product design.Original review:Prior to purchasing these I was using LG's HBS-730 Tone+ headphones. I liked the sound and feel, but reception was terrible. As I'm writing this review, I am sitting in my basement about 50 feet away from my phone and getting perfect reception.I wear glasses, so the behind-ear pads are mildly disruptive and I suspect the bend in my ears may become uncomfortable if I use them all day, but I'm typically putting on and off my headphones over the course of the day, so I'm not too concerned.Play/Pause, Next Track, Last Track, and volume control are all very easy to use.I am not a huge fan of over-processing, so do not use the built-in presets, but they do work and are easy to access.The voice updates on changing/accessing features seems a bit loud, but otherwise helpful.Definitely charge to full. On a full charge (charging light solid green), the headphones state ""more than 5 hours"" of battery time.The LED light is completely unobtrusive, so will not interfere with daily use.They seem just the right tightness; should have no issues if using in high-movement activities.Will update review if the need arises, but as of right now, very satisfied with these.",1.0,1353974400,"11 27, 2012",Motorola S11-Flex HD Wireless Stereo Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/White,83.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31QNQykR-0L._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1207},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories', 'Computer Components']]"

Given my last point, adjustable, you would think that would add points of failure, but this is one solid feeling headset.Water resistant.

There are plenty of good review here about the sound and quality so I just want to point out a couple minor problems I've experienced.I'm well experienced with different gadgets so when something really new comes along I'm certainly taking a look at the instructions, here the first problem. The instructions are not well written. Namely the use of the multi-function button (MFB) and how to wear them. This is really laughable, the picture on how to wear them in the instruction book is actually less than 1/2 inch square. Ok, so I figured that out without too much of a problem but then there's the MFB...Here, the instructions say hold in the MFB until you hear the voice options to make adjustments. I had to look this up because the bass was way too bass(y). Ok, I hear the voice but that's it. Nowhere does it say HOW or WHAT to do when you hear the selections. I looked online with no luck so eventually I called customer support and I was pleasantly surprised to get a representative in just a couple of minutes. That's where it ended! No matter how I explained it, the rep didn't understand what I wanted to do and the actual functioning of the the now (as I call it) the MF Button. After about 10 minutes I got disconnected from that rep and I did call back and quickly got another rep who was equally clueless as the the functioning of the settings. Eventually and incorrectly I might add, she told me that the button was supposed to bring up a menu on the phone to make those adjustments. With that piece of information I ended the call and started to consider returning the set. A week later I thought I would give CS one more chance and again, I quickly got a rep and just as before, the rep was clueless but this rep elevated the problem to tier 2 support for which I was supplied with an 800 number and told to give them a call, which I did.Unfortunately, the 800 number was worthless. No matter what buttons I pushed I could never reach a person of any any kind, much less any tier 2 support. (thanks to motorola for wasting 20 minutes of my time here). The good news was that after tinkering with the set during all of this I figured out how to work the MF button:To start the menu you press and hold and a voice will start going through the menu and when you hear eq setting you want, release the button. Yeah, it's that simple. I expect that for 100+ dollars that one sentence could have been put in the instructions. The differences are very subtle but that is how it works.

I will compare the two devices as I review this charger.Size: an important consideration as you may be carrying both in your pocket with your phone is charging, the Innergie is smallet and connects on the end so the cable allows it to bend and fit side by side in you pocket. The Motorola has a built in cable that may work well for Android phone, but is useless for my iPhone 3Gs (I know, I'm upgrading soon and then the Innergie cable will be useless as I get stuck with Apple's proprietary cable connectors, sigh). The Motorola USB connection is on the side of the device so carrying it while charging is much less convenient, as it will not line up with my phone, making for a bulky combination in my pocketCharge: the Innergie required 3-4 hours to get a full charge and offered about 1.5 full charges to my iPhone, the Motorola takes 5-6 hours to charge and offers about 2 full charges to my iPhone, neither is capable of fully charging my iPad retina.Plugs, Connecters, Lights: the innergie comes with a cord with multiple connecter types, the Motorola has the built in micro USB connecter but no USB cord for charging.

I liked how thin it is and thought it would work great for bike rides to keep my iPhone charged and it does.  However, it's almost a little too wide to fit nicely in the underseat pack I have on my bike.  With the iPhone USB charger plugged in, the device becomes even wider as there is only one USB outlet and it's on the long side.  Would have been nice to have it on the thinner end or an optional second one there.With the USB cable from my iPhone 5 plugged into the side I have to set the battery in the underseat pack at an angle.  I wasn't too keen on this thinking that it would bend my iphone charging cable and damage it so I tried to remove the cable and alas, it is permanently stuck into the thing!  I've tried just about everything short of taking the unit apart or using pliers to grip it out.  So now I have a permanent lightning charger in this and can't use the USB port for any of my other USB devices - unless, of course, they charge with the lightning adapter or use microUSB.  ** SEE MY UPDATE BELOW**As far as charging goes, this works well.  After charging the phone completely to 100% the battery pack will shut down as it's apparently no longer charging so goes into auto-shut-down mode to conserve its power.  So if you've left your device plugged into it, it will also stop charging and begin to rundown its battery if you have it turned on.I also have theNew Trent iTorch IMP52D 5200mAh External Battery Chargerand frankly I would recommend it over the Motorola P4000.  Both work fine for the intended purpose, but the New Trent seems to last longer on a single charge (it has 5200mAh while the Motorola is 4000mAh) and the charging outlets are on the end, it's narrower than the Motorola and, best of all, my cable does not get stuck so I can use it for several different devices that connect to power via USB.So I'd give this a higher star rating if my cable wasn't now permanently attached to it and if it had a USB port/outlet on the smaller end.**UPDATE 12/23/2012**I have raised this to a 3 star review because, thanks to a comment from ""Gadget Grant""  I was able to remove the cable!  I have added photos so you can refer to those if your USB cable gets stuck.  I also tried other cables in this device and so far the only ones that get stuck are the Apple Lightning cables (used to charge my iPhone 5 and my boyfriend's new iPad mini.  so apparently this issue is not Motorola's, but Apples. Although, I must say that so far this is the only usb outlet I""ve had trouble with the cable getting stuck, and I've had it plugged into other USB hubs, my Macbook Pro, my Mac Pro, a USB wall charger (non-apple), and the NewTrent battery mentioned above - all with no problem getting it back out of the device.So, if your cable gets stuck, see the photos on how to remove it using a thin piece of plastic.

I really like this feature, since I'm notorious for forgetting to bring along an extra cable.The power pack itself does not come with an adapter. Instead, it comes with a separate USB cable that will plug into your current Droid or iPhone/iPad/iPod charging adapter.

B009M27MBC,A33YZNZIRA3H97,l2,"[50, 51]","This is a really nice power pack, the best one that I have ever used. As with most Motorola products, build quality is excellent. The device is extremely slim so it can fit in your skinny jeans next to your phone, but it still packs a huge 4000mAh of battery power. Modern high powered smartphones usually have 1500 to 2000mAh batteries, so this power pack should recharge those twice. The 8W power output is high enough to charge tablets, unlike most lesser devices.The size is especially surprising. This thing is only 0.3 inch thick. 4000mAh power packs from other brands that I have seen are twice the size and won't easily fit in to your pants pocket like this one. The built-in micro-USB cable is a big feature; you never loose the cable and it does not add any bulk. With most power packs, you have to carry an extra and bulky cable with you, which is likely not going to fit in your pants pocket along with your phone and the charger. I also own a 10000mAh Anker power pack (for multi-day trips) and that is a much larger unit; 3 or 4 times the size of this Motorola when you include the cable.Some nice features of this device are automatic on/off so the battery won't run down when nothing is attached (as many cheap power packs will). The power test button is recessed into the side of the device so you can't accidentally activate it. A micro-USB cable is conveniently built in to the charger so you can never lose it. If you're charging an oddball device that doesn't use micro-USB, there is also a full-sized USB port so you can plug in your own cable.Yes, the price is more than what a generic 4000mAh power pack would cost, but I think the you get what you pay for with the quality level and super-thin size. If your smartphone or tablet burns a lot of power (like most 4G devices do these days) and you're going to be away from a wall socket all day and your device doesn't accept spare batteries (an unfortunate trend), then this is a great device to carry with you. You can even charge 2 devices at the same time, which is great way to meet people at the airport :)",5.0,1353369600,"11 20, 2012",Motorola P4000 Universal Portable Power Pack - Retail Packaging - Black,50.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31JWQwsRGWL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 83945},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Batteries', 'Battery Charger Cases']]"
B009M27MBC,A2W9GX82SLKROQ,Lenny,"[3, 4]","Some important specs :4000 mAH capacity1.6 mA maximum charging current (will charge devices that can handle higher currents faster)Can charge 2 devices at the same time (not mentioned, but I assume combined current is 1.6 mAH)Can charge other devices while itself is being rechargedLong description :This charger at first glance looks like a phone, and even weighs about as much as one. I've had a few people glance at me when I'm holding it, asking me what phone is that. It's shape makes it easy to hold together with the phone, or fit into your pocket if you're not wearing tight jeans, while connected to your phone and charging it. Among the 3 chargers I have, this is the only charger that can do that easily.The size is also its drawback. Battery technology means that you can only fit so much capacity into that size. The unit is rated at 4000 mAH. In reality, due to loss from multiple conversions and inefficiencies in charging batteries, you will not be able to get the full capacity. For example, my cell phone has a 1750 mAH battery. One would assume this means I can recharge my phone from empty to full more than twice from a fully charged power pack. In reality, I could only recharge it slightly less than 1.5 times. This is not a flaw, it is typical with all external battery packs.The 1.6 amp current output (8W) will recharge some devices faster than typical chargers this size, which are usually capable of only supplying 1 amp. For example, the Kindle Fire HD (which can take up to 2 amps for faster recharging) will charge about 60% faster with this compared with a 1 amp charger. Note that the capacity of this cannot fully recharge a Kindle Fire HD, but will provide you with an additional couple of hours of use. The extra current will not damage devices that cannot make use of it - devices will only draw what they need.The micro USB plug is nice to have, and means you may not have to bring a cable with you. The flat cable is held securely along the side of the unit by friction, and is about 6 inches long when pulled out all the way. On the side is one USB type A port for charging a second device (use your own cable), a micro USB port for charging the power pack from any USB power source, and a button. Press the button and the white LEDs on the unit (4 of them, on the front flat side, near the switch) will light up indicating the state of charge. A micro USB cable is provided, and you can use it either to charge a second device (that uses micro USB, obviously) or to use it for charging the power pack.The finish on the unit is a nice minimalist matte black. There's a very fine texture on the surface, and it feels smooth. The surface appears to mar easily (I had it in a bag with some other devices, and now there's some faint white marks I can't get rid of.Using it is extremely simple. Plug a device (phone, tablet, etc.) to it and it will start charging the device. Unplug and it stops. Plug a USB power source to its micro USB port, it will start recharging itself. There's circuitry built in for it to stop charging external devices when its charge gets too low (to prevent damage to its battery from over discharging). You can recharge the P4000 while you're charging another device from it - this is not true for all portable power packs. For example, the Anker Astro 5600 will not supply power to the charging port while it is being recharged. This is convenient because you don't need to switch cables - just plug everything in, let it recharge, and come back to check a couple of hours later.Without considering the price, I would have rated this 5 stars for an attractive appearance, good design, convenient shape, and extremely easy to use. However I feel that at $80 it is rather expensive, hence the 4 star rating.Additional notes for DIYers (not factored into rating) :I got a Raspberry Pi, and I wondered if this can function as a UPS for the Pi (spoiler : no). Basically, I want something that will pass through power to the Pi, but if the power supply is interrupted, I want it to seamlessly switch over to battery, and when power is restored, go back to the power supply (while recharging the battery).The P4000 is NOT SUITABLE for this purpose. While it looks good on paper, the problem is that when I connect or disconnect the cable from the USB wall charger to the P4000, the P4000 will briefly interrupt the power to the Pi for 1 to 2 seconds. This is not a problem for charging devices, but it is long enough to cause the Pi to reboot.",4.0,1354233600,"11 30, 2012",Motorola P4000 Universal Portable Power Pack - Retail Packaging - Black,50.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31JWQwsRGWL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 83945},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Batteries', 'Battery Charger Cases']]"

Every other power pack has required me to carry a separate cable which, even if it's a retractable, is still one more thing to have stuffed in my pocket.  The size is perfect, being about the same dimensions as a smartphone.  It's only 4000 mAh, putting it a little on the medium-small side of power packs but that's still enough to charge most phones 3+ times.  It's also light weight (attn: bikers, hikers, joggers).I do worry about what happens if that cable wears out.  I've found quite a lot of USB cables start to separate after just a few months.  This one looks better constructed with the cable head being fully enclosed, so hopefully it won't pull apart like the others but only time will tell (if this review is more than a few months old then apparently it's still doing okay because otherwise I'd come back to update this review!)  It does have a second power output slot, though, which takes a regular USB cable (included in box) so if the main cable does go bad, you've still got that secondary slot.  You can also charge two things at once (if you carry that additional cable around with you).You'll still need a cable to recharge it but that's fine -- at least I don't have to carry around with me all day.I like my old Energizer power pack too, but it's short and fat -- a bit too bulgy for a jeans pocket -- and while the magnetically attached cable on it was cool, it's not as cool or convenient as the integrated cable in this Motorola pack.Solid win here.

I haven't even bothered trying to charge a laptop with it; it would just be too slow and wouldn't be able to charge much at all, not to mention I'd need a USB adapter. If I had an iPhone instead, I'd also need to buy a separate adapter. Inconvenient.- The design is odd and not too user friendly: there are no markings on the outside of it. E.g., which ports are for charging the bank itself, and which for charging other devices? This isn't a trivial question because Motorola placed one of each kind right next to each other with no indication of which is which.- My biggest gripe is that when I'm out and about and end up needing the power pack to charge up my phone, the power pack dies and I have no way to charge it on the go. I can't plug it in at Starbucks without having to carry an adapter or two (which defeats the point of this device being small and convenient to carry). If I were going to be away from home for a few days, I'd definitely want something else that's more flexible.In the end I feel that there are better options available, as the small size of this one doesn't offset the inconvenience of needing to buy and carry separate adapters to charge anything other than my phone.",3.0,1355011200,"12 9, 2012",Motorola P4000 Universal Portable Power Pack - Retail Packaging - Black,50.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31JWQwsRGWL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 83945},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Batteries', 'Battery Charger Cases']]"

Lionel,"[0, 0]","I've got quite a collection of rechargeable power products, from the ill-fated Zagg Sparq 2 to a noname 3800maH pack that works reasonably well, to a teensy 800maH ""Eveready"" brand charger that is pretty wimpy.  The Motorola P4000 Portable Power Pack is better in many ways than all of these. First of all, it is slim - about the size of an iPhone 5 or of many Android phones. Sleek in appearance, an integrated cord with MicroUSB plug wraps around two sides of the device and fits in flush to the edges.  On the long edge are a standard USB ""B"" jack, a MicroUSB jack (used to charge the internal battery) and an on-off button, all recessed slightly. A short USB ""B"" to MicroUSB cord is included.To charge the Power Pack, connect the cord to a USB power source and plug in the MicroUSB end to the recessed jack. While it is charging, you can use either or both of the USB B jack and the integrated MicroUSB cord to power one or two devices.  The Power Pack automatically stops charging itself once full.Of course, the real purpose of such a product is to charge your portable device away from AC power. While Motorola doesn't say explicitly, the reference to 4000 in the model number leads me to believe that the battery capacity is 4000maH.  The size of the battery is about right for that, but I could be completely off. Motorola talks about an 8W charging rate, or 1600ma current. This will charge most tablets, and smaller devices will charge faster than from a standard 500ma USB2 jack.I like how sleek the power pack is - it easily slips into a pocket or briefcase.

I like the versatility that we can use it with different products (we have so many in our three-person family!).  I like that it holds a good amount of power and will charge my iPad.Cons:  For the price, I would have expected this item to come with a wall plug for the micro-usb power input.  I was able to use my iphone's wall outlet with a standard usb-usb cord, but it just seems to me if you have a dedicated micro-usb input, that you could include a wall adapter for that micro-usb input when there's an $80 price tag.The unit arrived with only one battery light still lit, which makes me think the power off button doesn't really prevent the battery from draining - even though the literature says it's not supposed to drain when off.  Time will tell how long this holds a charge, and I will update this review in a few weeks.Update:  It does hold a charge well and it does charge my devices.  It's nice and lightweight, comparatively.  I have a small pouch I keep it in which doesn't take up much room in my purse.One thing that's annoying is it has taken one of my iPhone lightning cords hostage.  It simply won't let go.

B009M27MBC,A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE,wbentrim,"[0, 1]","Motorola P4000 Universal Portable Power PackThe P4000 is very similar to the P793.  They both fit the following criteria below.  I could not get the mAh out of Motorola chat to know specifically why the P4000 is considered more ""beefy"" than the P793.  It is larger, the same size as my DroidX as opposed to the P793 which fits on the screen of the Droid.  The ""chat"" person said it has greater charging capacity.  Motorola claims you can even charge your tablet with the P4000.  It does NOT come with an AC charger.  You can use your AC phone charger to charge it or the included USB cable.  It will charge your phone much quicker than the P793.  I guess I can't give it a raving review because I can't accurately determine how much better it is than the P793.  If it is more than twice as quick or will charge more devices, it may be worth the double and some price tag of $79.99 at Amazon.  Frankly I haven't seen a huge difference between the two units.  If you need more juice, go with the P4000, otherwise the P793 seems more than adequate.The rest of this is applicable to both the P793 and the P4000 but if you read my review on the P793, you can stop here.Like many of us, I have found myself increasingly dependent on my phone.  I get positively paranoid if I forget my phone on my desk.  My palms get sweaty when I find my self evaluating the time left on my phone battery.  I feel the remaining time in excruciating detail as I wait for my life to go black!  Reading his over, I am increasingly despondent on how fixated I have become on cellular reception.  It isn't just to chit chat, Oh No!, nothing as simple as chit chat.I want to find the best price on gasoline with GasBuddy.  I want to check on Roethlisberger's condition.  Arrghh! I want to check the stock market or ball game score and I can't do any with a DEAD battery.There is hope and it isn't expensive.  This is the perfect item when you find yourself charger-less.  Those of you who have never, ever left your charger someplace you wish you hadn't may cast the first stone. Otherwise, button up and be aware there is a simple solution.  This little fellow is smaller and thinner than my DroidX and will recharge it while I am using it.  It seems to have double the strength of the battery on the Droid.  For $27.69 at Amazon, you can slip this in your briefcase, jean's pocket or duct tape it to the back of your phone and have TWICE as long to stay connected.  Motorola P793Universal and portable, the P793 is a power pack that can simultaneously charge multiple devices, including mobile devices like the iPhone, Bluetooth headsets, and MP3 players. With 1420 mAh capacity, the P793 can provide up to an additional five hours of talk time.It has a single micro USB connector that will fit many items besides your phone and a standard USB if you have your charging cable.  It charged to full charge in less than two hours.  This would make a great stocking stuffer.  Four star only because I really can determine if it is worth more than 2x the price of the P793.

B009NIRHRY,A7PAPE702B20U,Pmm368,"[13, 14]","Edited on 3/10/2014I've had this phone in my possession for a few months now.  I should've edited my review sooner, but better late than never, right?  Here goes:  This phone works okay if you need a replacement smartphone or if you don't plan on doing much, you may as well get a feature phone.  This phone runs out of memory a lot.  All I had to do was install iHeartRadio, Facebook & Dropbox and my phone is already telling me that the internal memory is low.  That's my biggest complaint with the phone.Old ReviewI bought this phone a few days ago because my old phone provider, Virgin Mobile, wasn't good in terms of coverage.  Sure, their pricing was okay, but I could hardly use my internet because I only got 1 bar at home, 3 to 5 in town if I'm lucky.  I was hardly able to use 3G in most places.  There was 3 areas where I could go to use 4G.  In either case of 3G or 4G, internet speeds were subpar at best and ping was a bit high as well.I decided to make the switch to T-Mobile.  I  had them once before, but with an iPhone 3G (at the time, I wasn't able to get 3G yet).  This phone is cheaper and certainly more features than the iPhone 3G.When I bought this phone, I went through the Walmart Family Plan deal.  For those of you wanting to do the same thing, be warned: T-Mobile/Wal-Mart does NOT provide you with a sim card.  You have to pay $25 ON TOP OF the service plan.  I didn't know this before buying the phone.  Even though I can get a discount through my work, I'd rather not pay that much just for a sim card if that's all it is and no credit towards the first month.  However, seeing as this is a T-Mobile phone (Wal-Mart Family Plan is covered by T-Mobile), I was able to get a hold of a temporary T-Mobile sim card and it worked.  I'm glad Wal-Mart decided not to block you from using a regular T-Mobile sim card to get you to use theirs.  I did see T-Mobile sim cards for $10 and that they still have a $30 unlimited text & data (first 5gb's of 4G) with 100 minutes for new activations.Internet:This phone does have 3G (1700/2100 band).  Living in a rural city, I get about 2 or 3mbps download speeds.  I tested this phone in two other cities.  One suburban area gave me about 4 mbps and the other area gave me an average of 5 to 6mbps.  I saw the Ping around 100 to 150MS with a decent signal.  I'm impressed by that for 3g.  I saw upload speeds around 1mbps to 2mbps.  If 3G is that fast, I can only imagine what 4G will be like when I go to upgrade to a 4G phone.  The one thing I did not know is that this phone also has a Mobile HotSpot feature.  That's a cool feature I wasn't expecting.  Last time I remember, it does cost $15 extra per month to use it.  Up to 8 devices can connect to this phone at one time for internet service.If you need to save your battery until you get a hold of a charger, there is an option to enable 2G only.  My speed tests shows I get about 100 to 300 kbps download & upload speeds in 2G mode.  However, 2G doesn't seem to work in some areas.  I went to a supermarket and 2G didn't show up inside or outside the building, leaving me with no internet.  Turning on 3G did the trick, but will burn through data faster if you're not already throttled (aka going over your data limit).Camera:T-Mobile/ZTE advertises that this phone contains a 2MP camera.  That is false information.  After looking in the camera settings, this phone takes 3MP pictures.  The photos come out okay, but I've used worse cameras for pictures.  The shutter is a bit slow, so make sure your target isn't moving until after the picture preview shows, or your subject will come out blurry.  The camera does not include Macro, which means it can't take photos up close (less than 70cm away).  The phone doesn't have flash either.The camera can record videos as well.  Like pictures, it's not the worst quality I've seen.  This phone records at a video resolution of 640x480 at up to 15 frames per second from what I've seen in my tests.  According to the quality setting mode, I can record 30 minutes at high quality or 10 minutes for YouTube.  At high quality, I believe it records at 1.5mbps.Memory:The one thing I highly dislike about this phone is that it has very low internal memory.  About 128mb's I believe.  At least a 4gb memory card was included.  I already ran out of memory once while trying to install an 8mb file, even after moving all the apps I could over to the SD card.  Turns out some apps were taking a lot of memory.I will update more later when I try the other features, such as the mobile hot spot.",3.0,1377302400,"08 24, 2013",ZTE Concord V768 T-Mobile Android Phone (A),78.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-OD1tPknL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 15402},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"

I really loved everything about this phone, from the design to the large screen to the speed. Then, it started to suck more and more. Instead of finishing this review, I'll just compose a list of everything that has malfunctioned since purchasing the phone in November 2013:1.) Rear-Facing Camera: The rear-facing camera suddenly stopped working and nothing I do could fix it. Tried clearing cache and force stopping the app. Did not work. Tried uninstalling all updates. Did not work. Soft reset on phone and then hard reset on phone. Did not work.2.) Speaker: When I am on the phone with someone, I have to put it on speakerphone just to be able to hear the person I'm talking to. Mind you, this phone has never been near water or was not physically damaged in any way, shape, or form.3.) Battery life: Was great. Now it's declining tremendously. I used to get about 12 hours out of the phone and now I get about 5. I don't have many apps installed/running and I have the device on power saver. How does this happen? Plus, it takes about 6 hours to achieve a full charge. My iPhone literally takes about a half hour to reach 100% from 0%.4.) Glitches: Phone will force stop applications on its own and will randomly turn off and reboot.  It freezes often, also.With all said, I think I am done buying Android operated phones until they could create a OS that is more substantial and functional. Since every Android-based phone I have had, regardless of brand/model, has taken a crap on me, I'm assuming that it's because of the OS.

B00E92AV2W,A3533SODHQZRLC,C. Wilson,"[24, 25]","The Moto X seems to do all the things I need a smartphone to do and it does them well.  I use mine with Republic Wireless which costs me about $10.00 a month as of the date of this review.  It's not the fastest phone and doesn't have the biggest screen, but it's fast enough and the screen is big enough and I'm fairly picky about my gadgets.  I've never found myself waiting on the phone's software to do something I asked and I can read text on the screen and watch videos that look great.  It doesn't have the most memory but it has more than enough for my daily business and nightly personal and entertainment use.  The battery lasts long enough for regular phone, email, text with a moderate amount of entertainment use each day and lasts longer than any other phone I've owned.  I charge it overnight on the nightstand.  However, if you plan to stream videos or music four hours a day in addition to several hours of telephone calls and other use, you might be disappointed in the battery life.  Reading some of these other reviews,  I think teenagers and college students (the ultimate power users) will never have enough battery power.  Keep in mind I use this for phone calls, email and texting mostly and the entertainment apps are an added benefit for when I don't have a tablet available.When the phone arrived, it was much thinner and lighter than I had expected.  The form factor is rests easily in my hand and doesn't make a large bulge in my front pants pocket.  The weight isn't enough to pull down on my pants or get in the way.  It weighs much less than the iphone or a Nokia 920.  The case material isn't too ""grabby"" or too slippery.  Easy to get in and out of my pocket.  The buttons are in the right place. I've used it for three months now & dropped it several times and it has no scratches on the screen or the back of the phone.  The black phone has an elegant and professional look that is fine for the formality of a more traditional business office.  To me, the Blackberry makes a ""corporate drone"" statement.  The new iPhone says ""I'm a teenage girl or perhaps a tech fashionista who really likes to text, tweet and play video games.  This phone (in simple black at least) says something completely different and in between those two extremes.  The more colorful customization's available allows the flexibility to broadcast whatever image you want.Most importantly, the phone is open to many software modifications and much customization.  If you like to tinker and adjust your gadgets this is the phone for you.  If you have trouble working a VCR, care mostly about texting and listening to music & watching videos on a cell phone, then the iPhone is probably the best product for you.  The Windows 8 phones aren't good for either group.  They're best for employees of Microsoft to use when they're at the office and the boss is watching.With the Android software on the Moto X I can tell the battery how best to spend it's energy during different times of the day or during particular uses.  I was able to program it to do away with the lock screen when I'm in range of my home WiFi so I'm not constantly having to enter an access code to use the phone when I'm home.  When I leave my house the lock screen turns back on to protect the phone.  The phone takes excellent pictures & video when needed.  Most anything I can do on a PC or a tablet can be done on this phone.  Not that I would want to, but sometimes you're just not around a PC and I don't like carrying a tablet everywhere with me. I've been able to program to phone to let different alerts and notices through the lock screen depending upon my geographic location,  time of day and the kind of notice.  For example, emergency weather alerts can get through any time, but regular weather reports cannot.  Email from certain individuals sounds a chime, but  I can tell it to be quiet for most other email.  When the alarm goes off in the morning it calls my name in a pleasant voice and tells me the current weather conditions.  If I don't touch the phone for ten minutes after that, it tells me in a polite voice to get out of bed and get to work.""  These are just a few examples of the world of customization that's opened up using Moto X running Android.For reference, I've owned and used a Nokia 920, an iPhone 3Gs, an iPad 2, an iPad 4 and a Microsoft Surface RT.  I also went through a faze where I tried to get away from smartphones and use dumb-phones such as ""John's Phone"" and ""Snapphone"" which are both sold through Amazon.  My very first computer was an Apple Macintosh (yes I know. . .  dating myself).  I ended up bailing on Apple computes when Steve Jobs left the company, quality control went bad and there was little usable business software that was available for their machines.  I haven't bought a Motorola cellphone product since the original RAZR.  The Moto X is also my first Android product.The later model iPhone's work well but are extraordinarily expensive and limiting in terms of the software that is available.  When I first used the iPhone, the Apple ""sandbox"" seemed big enough but I quickly out grew the sandbox when I encountered a great deal of trouble finding programs that would help me get things done.  The same thing happened in the late 80's when I found that Apple computers lacked enough business and work related software to be an effective tool for projects (This would change once Steve Jobs came back to Apple).  For Apple, most apps are games that I will never use or enjoy.  In my mind, an iPhone has become an elaborate expensive toy for teenage girls or tech fashionistas (not that there's anything wrong with that).  When someone says ""iPhone"" to me now, a picture of a very young woman with glitter nail polish wildly tapping out a text message with her thumbs comes to mind.  Not that there's anything wrong with games, teenagers or fashionistas.  .  . it's just that I'm not in that particular user group.  I tried using the Nokia 920 and Surface RT with Windows Phone 8 software for seven months.  Unfortunately, the apps are so far behind both Apple and Android that the Surface RT and Nokia 920 aren't really in the same league.  I tried hard to use them. I spent a lot of money on them and I wanted them to work.  The screens on both devices are large and beautiful.  However, the list of things you can't do using Windows 8 for the Surface RT and Windows Phone 8 is much larger than the list of things you can do.  The absence of software might very well kill them off.  The ability  of the Nokia 920 and Surface RT to work better with Microsoft PC software such as Outlook, doesn't begin to make up for all the other shortcomings.Hope this review helps some of you make up your mind on which products are best for you.  For those who disagree, please know that I am not an Android fan-boy and I have no financial interest in helping or hurting any people or businesses that make or use cell phones and the software the work with.",5.0,1390521600,"01 24, 2014","Motorola Moto X - 16GB, Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Black",312.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GidV1ch5L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3391},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"
B00E92AV2W,A14T3IEJX18CNZ,Dale K,"[123, 133]","I purchased the Moto X from Sprint about a week ago, taking advantage of their new One Up program (phone cost me .42).  A little background to my Smartphone usage.  My first Smartphone was the HTC Incredible, so I have an extremely high standard for what a good Smartphone is.  I loved the Incredible.  I followed that up with the Samsung Galaxy S2, to extreme disappointment.  What a hunk of crap that phone was.  So, when the opportunity arose to dump the crap box ahead of my contract renewal, I jumped on it.I debated between going back to HTC with the One or going with the new Motorola Moto X.  I was hesitant at first about the X, but figured, it's made by Google, why wouldn't it be great?  I was correct.  The key to making the most out of this phone is to not gimp it out.  Use Google, leave the GPS and WiFi on.  The battery life is outstanding and lasts well into a day and a half even with all the features turned on.  The bonus to letting the phone do what it does is it makes life better.  This morning I had an up to the minute traffic update on my phone 10 minutes to my normal leaving time.  It knows my house and my work.  The voice commands are simple (despite what others are saying) and work amazing well if you take the time to really learn them.

B00E92AV2W,A2LQXFZWEMNPHZ,Ken in Denver,"[8, 9]","Full disclosure: I didn't buy this phone from Amazon, I bought it directly from Motorola. I've been using the Moto X for about 4 months now, and this review is based my experience over long term use.It's hard to define what, exactly, makes the Moto X so good. It isn't the spec sheet -- the Moto X lags the competition there. It isn't exactly the feature list either -- the feature list is competitive, but most of the unique Moto X features don't feel like ""features"" at all -- they just feel like part of the phone. In other words, Motorola's software doesn't make me think. It requires no concentration to untangle, a benefit that stands in stark contrast to the unwieldy software bundled on HTC or, even worse, Samsung devices. While competitors are adding new levers and buttons, the Moto X just makes the existing levers more useful.And it all looks cohesive and feels pleasurable. At the end of a day, still with a 50% charge (battery life is superb), I'll hold my oh-so-ergonomic phone happily in hand and I'll say to it, ""Okay Google Now, set alarm for 8:00 AM."" It'll work. While I sleep, the phone will only let important calls in and won't light up. When I have it face up on my desk, it occasionally shows the time and some notifications on the screen -- ones that show up immediately when I pull my phone out of my pocket. Just the fact that I don't have to turn my phone on to see who texted me is itself a killer feature.My phone knows when I'm driving, knows when I'm in a meeting, and doesn't bother me when I want privacy. It listens to my voice from across the room (but only after hearing the words, ""Okay Google Now""), and it knows my voice from others. It prompts me for my unlock PIN code when I'm on the town, but not when I'm at home.The Moto X isn't perfect. It doesn't always understand a command, and I wish it could figure out that if I'm at a bar at 2:00 AM, maybe I should be sleeping, but I'm not. Its sleep feature is based only on the time of day. And I wish I could configure Google Now to pull information from email accounts other than gmail. But nothing is perfect.But having said that, this phone is as close to perfect as I've seen, and probably better than most phones that will come out for years to come.",5.0,1397520000,"04 15, 2014","Motorola Moto X - 16GB, Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Black",312.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GidV1ch5L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3391},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"
B00E92AV2W,A2HH1MK56OW5YS,Mike Jay,"[14, 16]","Disclaimer: I own the Moto X GSM Developer Edition 32gb (used with T-Mobile). It is a slightly different variant of the particular model in this listing, but my experience will not vary in any way from the one mentioned here. This was the closest I could find on Amazon. It's otherwise all the same internals, functions, features, and shortcomings. At the time of writing running Kit Kat 4.4. Also the phone in this ad is ""unlocked"" for the carrier service (T-Mobile, AT&T;), not the bootloader, which are two very different things.I can highly recommend the Moto X, as long as the camera and customer service are not a concern for you (see Cons below).***** Pros:-First and most important - call quality: Excellent. I sometimes drive a rather loud diesel truck at work, and had a lot of issues with my last phone's quality. When I got this I couldn't wait to try it in that truck as a test. When I talked to the first person I was expecting something like ""I can tell you are driving but still hear some noise, not as bad as your last phone"". That would have been acceptable to me. But the person had no idea I was in the truck at all. The only comment was that that I did get a little bit louder when I stopped the vehicle. Very impressive! The noise cancelling technique (it has 3 mics) must be well designed.-Specs: maybe not ""top of the line"" this year, at least on paper. But that is needlessly scaring away people. This phone is fast and stable because they have perfectly optimized the resources that are available. Since when is 1.7ghz and 2gb ram on a phone not enough? Only the most hardcore benchmarker will scoff at that. The X8 system is a creative use of cores and it just works.-System: Very smooth, graphic games run great, no glitches or bugs so far. Fast update to Kit Kat 4.4, with 4.4.2 expected soon -as of this writing. Multitasks very well. In fact I`m now using some multiple floating windows with the Xposed framework and it's flawless (root required).-Loudspeaker: Impressive for the phone size. Louder and better sound than my 17"" Toshiba laptop (which actually isn't saying much, it's lame to begin with).-Moto X specific: This is where things get interesting! They have done well adding a few things you didn't know you needed until you try them. The Active Display is a nice touch and certainly useful, not just a gimmick. But it could be improved IMO if they also added a sort of ""LED""  function that work make use of the normal LED feature in some apps and instead flash a cluster of pixels to ""imitate"" an LED light for notifications even when the phone is just sitting on a table for example. The ""twist to open camera"" is useful if you use it a lot, I don't in particular but I`m glad it's there. Touchless Commands are a Godsend and I hope this changes the game for every manufacturer. This sounds like a feature that's on every newer phone and often gets confused with other things, believe me it's not but should be. I lay this on the table to charge and a half hour later ask it what is 15% off 43 and it just tells me. That is awesome and hope I never have to do without it now. This is only one example of Touchless out of many that have changed the way I use my phone, period. It will make it seem lame that you ever had to turn your screen on to get things done.-Advanced (not recommended): Semi-easy to unlock and root for the knowledgeable. If you don't think it looks easy, you shouldn't attempt it. It's so comforting to see TWRP as my recovery, knowing my Nandroid backups are always there (and saved to laptop). Unlocking the bootloader will void your warranty, unless you have the DE like mine. Xposed framework and GravityBox work well, and Floating Windows are new to me and work impressively. No, I wont provide advice for unlocking and/or rooting.***** Neutrals:-Size: A pretty good compromise. Sometimes when I use it for a length of time I wish the screen was bigger. But when I carry it all day in my pocket, I`m glad it's smaller.-Build quality: Appears well made, perhaps not bulletproof being all plastic. I am drop prone and already dropped it 3 times with no trouble. But due to the fact I`m drop prone I would never think of having a phone with no case, so I`m sure that has helped it survive with zero problems. The one I use is the Supcase ""Unicorn Beetle hybrid"" available on Amazon. I have rated it good as well.-SD Card: built in is all you get, so I highly recommended 32gb for future use. It's less than convenient at times, but I understand what Google is trying to do. Overall not a big factor for me.-Battery life: Acceptable as expected, but my hopes weren't high. Not great, but few Androids are. Just the nature of the beast for now. Sure you can disable everything that makes it ""smart"" and greatly improve battery life, but then you have a ""dumb"" phone. I leave WiFi on, background sync on, gps on, Google Now on, pretty much everything but bluetooth which I never use. In short, I leave it ""smart"". My experience is varied. Sometimes it seems like I burn through 10% in a half hour. Other times I have intentionally tried to kill the battery to ""recalibrate"" and it takes forever to run down. It almost seems opposite of my last Android... it would take a long time to lose 10%, and then go down very quickly. This seems to lose the first 10-20% quickly, then slow down in it's discharge rate. Nothing scientific here, just my own observation.Usage example: In a normal day I unplug at 7:30am, use it for mostly ""connectivity"" i.e. checking email, messaging, weather, ""Googling"", make a few calls, and I`m a habitual setting changer and new app junkie. Occasionally I`ll play a game when bored but nothing too graphic intensive, and rarely watch full videos (though I often get locked in the YouTube ""A.D.D. suggested video distraction loop""). I`ll still have about 20-30% left on a typical day when I plug it in at 10:00pm. To me that passes for good enough. If you play games for 2 hours or watch entire movies at a time, you can bet you'll be plugging in much sooner.***** Cons:-Camera: For the cost of this phone, unacceptable and my only real complaint. Don't believe the ""low light"" hype. This thing is pretty lame for 90% of pictures with an occasional lucky one that looks good. Sure you'll get a brighter pic in low light but it will be so noisy it's unpleasant to even look at. For ""scanning"" documents it's adequate. Flash is very bright, sometimes to the point of making the pic worse with glare; but it does make a great flashlight with an app to turn it on as such. Wasn't a deal breaker for me, but may be for some.-Support: There aren't enough bad words to describe my experience with so called customer care. It was careless. It was pathetic. It was degrading to almost sub human level. My experience started out bad and only got worse the more I called. I have spent hours on the phone getting issues ""escalated"" only to wait for calls ""within the day"" that never happen. Their trouble started with a blown Cyber Monday deal and just snowballed from there. The reps seem to have no product training and nothing but canned responses that have little to do with your question. Should you require the assistance of Motorola's customer care-less, God help you and good luck. If you just want a phone that works, the Moto X is a great choice. If you are the type that demands good customer service to back up a product, my opinion is to run from Motorola as fast as you can.",5.0,1388793600,"01 4, 2014","Motorola Moto X - 16GB, Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Black",312.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GidV1ch5L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3391},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

Since upgrading, I have noticed an incredibly responsive Ice Cream Sandwich Android OS, superb voice recognition using Google's &#34;ok, google, now&#34; feature, 90% responsiveness using NFC tags, and 100% responsiveness to the &#34;twist twice&#34; camera shortcut. And at such a cheap price (only $200 if you go through Republic Wireless), there's no going wrong.  The battery life is very decent, but I wil admit it's annoying that if I am using maps AND listening to Pandora while driving AND charging the phone using my car charger, the phone will still ultimately discharge.  The GPS and data and bluetooth all on at the same time are too much for it to charge.  After doing this for about 2 hours, the phone will die.  So I guess more battery life is to be desired, but I personally would not sacrifice it's incredibly smooth and sleek form factor for this extended battery life.  I'd much rather get a case that doubles as a battery, which still as of March 2014 does not exist for some reason.  I will not ding the phone for battery life, as it is leaps and bounds better than my old Defy XT.I love the NFC, too.

(awesome feature!) I have had it for a few months now, and I'm still in love. Both my kids also have Moto X phones (from Republic Wireless) and they work awesome. Especially considering the plan only cost $10 per month.I had a Motorola Droid Razr, and I was so annoyed with the delayed updates, and the overall experience. I then got a Nexus 4, and I swore I'd never buy a non Nexus phone again. The Moto X made me change my mind.Motorola has done a complete 180 since Google started influencing their phones. The hardware is solid. The radios are beefy (they get a stronger signal than the average phone) fast updates (My Moto X got 4.4.2 OTA before my Nexus 4 did), almost stock android experience, and the very few things they do add, only make it better. The screen is one of the best I have ever used. (the blacks are so black, and the colors are not over saturated)The battery lasts me all day. The on-screen notifications is my favorite feature. It makes a little blinky light seem so archaic. The voice features are wonderful when driving. I don't even have to touch my phone to make a call or type and send a message.

The 4.4.3 update also ruined the dialer function with an ugly and dysfunctional replacement and revised the graphical user interface to look like more like a kindergarten toy or Windows-type, Tile-based phone - UGLY, STUPID and CHILDISH!!!

B00E92AV2W,ASSZPV1XZ2VT2,uzevla,"[3, 10]","First time I saw Moto X I was impressed with the 4.7"" LCD in a phone that is only 65mm wide. Also I liked the curved back as that's how your hands are - 10.5mm in the middle is not an issue while 5.5 toward edges helps with smaller hands.However, after using it for a while the design is not that good at all. It's slippery (I thought the mesh design of the back plate is actually a rubberized 3D mesh) and it's hard to handle. In fact, the phone has more bulk in the upper half - just rotate it for 180 degrees and you'll see it fits your hand better. The part where this phone design really fails for me is when I tried it along my old LG L9. LG fits my hand so perfectly that I thought this Moto must be a bit wider. However LG L9 is 3mm wider. However I am not knocking off a single star for this design - 65mm leaves plenty of room for a nice case and all together it'll be about the width other 4.7"" phones have.What's really bad about this phone is the LCD. It's a crappy AMOLED, very similar to what Samsung used in SG3 with the maximum brightness not going past 350nits. HTC and iphone have LCDs that go over 500 nits for years now. I feel like idiot every time I want to see the screen in the sun - 400$ in 2014 and I can't see it because Motorola decided to follow Samsung's gimmick of using low brightness LCDs so they can tell their battery lasts longer. This phone was supposed to be something better than all that Samsung crap - no useless gimmicks such as AMOLED (fake punchy colors as one of the main selling points, 1080p that your can't see or at least you don't care about having a power hog lcd).I also understand that manufactures are pressed by all those ""professional"" review websites that influence buyers a lot. Those noobs are regularly comparing things like battery life during video playback on *maximum brightness* not the same brightness. That's why every HTC ends up having poor battery life while Samsung's are much better. Too bad motorola decided to follow this.Icing on the cake is the automatic adjustment of the white color to be gray so it consumes less energy. Pretty much kills the superior contrast AMOLED offers and eve nfurther reduces the visibility in the sun. Samsung and Cyagenmod have that power save feature as an option under Settings->Display so I can disable it. Moto X can't.What really works in favor of this phone is the motorola software. Voice commands and Assist app work really good - you can see that motorola put some significant effort to provide a variety of software features so that your phone interacts with you in all kind of situations, such as disabling the ringer if you are in the meeting to automatically starting the driving mode when it senses you are in the car. Most notably, you can add your bluetooth devices as Trusted Devices so the phone stays unlocked if those are connected.",3.0,1397260800,"04 12, 2014","Motorola Moto X - 16GB, Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Black",312.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GidV1ch5L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3391},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

The processor is pretty good, but I hear some sound crackles now and then when playing X-Plane (high quality flight simulator which ran fine on a Nexus S) and some minor hesitation when scrolling on large websites.  Little stuff, but evidence of it being a mid-range phone in some ways.However, this should be a mass market success because of the stuff that is good:1. Plenty of memory to leave a browser with multiple tabs open, switch among email, Twitter app, and maybe check the Play market for some app you just read about, and then back to the browser instantly without it having been closed to save memory.  Smooth uninterrupted use of multiple common phone functions.2. A display which is as high-resolution as you can reasonably want it to be (given limits of human vision) for a phone which is as big as it can be and still be comfortable in any pocket and, though not as wide-angle viewable as high-end phones, mostly looks fine (better than my Nexus S for sure) and is bright enough for outdoor daylight use when necessary.3. A processor which works fine for most games, even if the most intensive 3d stuff has small signs of the hardware limitation.4. A battery which actually lasts all day with a fair reserve chunk left over.  This is a big one, because no amount of pixels and megahertz and RAM will impress your friends if your battery is dead.  Even a lot of high-priced phones have batteries which just barely make it to happy hour as they die.  Typical mid-range phones have usually had 1500mAh batteries or less.  This one is 2000mAh, so your can actually do the things described above all day, and when you get home you've still got about a third of the battery left or more compared to your previous phone.  Motorola seems to have made this phone fairly efficient as well.  A lot of the cheap phones from Chinese manufacturers (sometimes re-branded for your cell carrier) get shorter battery life than major brands with the same size battery.  So It's got a big battery and isn't wasteful with it.So it does everything most people want to do, does most of that fairly well, does it all day, and doesn't cost too much.

Compared to my Nexus 4 there was a slight rattle sound when texting with the haptic feedback (vibrating keys) turned on.  I have this turned off on all my phones, so I turned it off anyway.  It was very slight and would not have changed my opinion about the phone.  It is probably due to the fact the phone is entirely plastic.

I can honestly say I was wrong. As a lot of reviews have noted with the moto g and e, it seems motorola set out to see how much they could pack into each price point, and they managed to put in a lot.The good:-Screen - crisp, bright, excellent viewing angles.-LTE - On AT&T; it is fast (over 25mb/s consistently).-Fast Processor - A definite improvement over my Cyanogenmod-flashed Galaxy S3.-Battery Life - Easily get a day of battery life, usually at 40% after 15 hours off the charger (~2.5 hours of browsing, ~3 hours of music, ~1hr phone calls, ~15 texts, 5 push e-mail accounts, google now and wunderground syncing, with wifi on all day)- Software - I came from a rooted and cyanogenmod-flashed phone, which is very close to stock android. The minimal changes motorola has made to stock android are much appreciated and I expect the updates will be coming close behind each android release.The bad:-The Camera - Motorola seems to always have subpar cameras, and this is no exception. It is about as bad as my original htc evo 4g, but on a positive note it will force me to take my compact camera to events needing decent photos.-Grip - Slippery to hold in my hand. Hoping that the grip shell improves the feel.-Earpiece quality - Definitely sounds cheap and hollow. I will get used to it over time, but it does show where sacrifices had to be made.-Non-Replaceable Battery - This one I added just because it is right under the shell, and yet is not removable for some reason.Overall I am extremely happy with this phone.

This is good looking, handy phone. Few advantages are as below:1. It is unlocked. You can use it with any carrier. No need to go for any contract or pay more for plan. E.g. if you take ATT no contract probally you need to have a connection with them for 6 month. That will cause money. So, if you have lower cost carrier it is best.2. Best part is you get an update for Kitkat. The new OS is great. It takes less processing memory. I think now you get Kitkat only for moto x and others are till working on it. So, it is great to have an eary update.3. Price. Nicely priced. It is hard to get a phone with all these in $200 price range.4. Battery life - It is another loving point. The battery life is really good. With normal use you can have a full day battery life. Some time it goes more than 2days.5. It is Quad-band GSM phone. So, I can carry this phone any where in the world. So, if you are traveling a lot no need to change the phone.6. It has a nice display. The screen is OK for a smart phone. (4.5)7. Get 50GB in google drive.But it has few disadvantages also:1. Camera - The camera in this phone is not so great. I will say it just takes picture. If you are looking for a good camera, you may wish to have a different one.2. It does come with a wall charger and headphone. Motorola may think to add them. This is not a hudge problem for me as I have some from my old devices.3. It does not work with all car charges. I have tired to use my charge with I use for my samsung but it did not work. I have to find the reason.4. No extandable memory. So, you are stuck with only device memory. But you get 50GB in google drive for 2 years. So, if you use cloude it is good.5. You can not replace battery easily. But it maynot be a problem for most of you if it works.6. If you are very heavy user you may not get enough processing power.7. The speaker does not work some time.So, by looking all this if you are a common man and want to have a good smart phone for normal use you can have it.",5.0,1388361600,"12 30, 2013",Motorola Moto G - Global GSM - Unlocked - 8GB (Black),168.93,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZjdGB55nL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 472},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

B00GWR36F6,A21O5ULBAZD8SZ,Brian White,"[3, 3]","Oddly - I recently sold my iPhone 5S after much frustration with Touch ID and the finicky fingerprint sensor. Bought an unlocked 5S direct from an Apple store in September and kinda missed Android. After four months, sold it and could have bought three Motorola G units in its place!Was looking at the Nexus 5 (owned a Nexus 4 for almost a year), and loved the screen resolution and top-of-the-line specs. but, decided to try this instead (even with the Moto X sitting at $329). After sideloading the GEL interface from the Nexus 5 and after the KitKat 4.4.2 instant upgrade after I first turned it on - and setting to ART instead of Dalvik), this unit is basically flawless in its performance. I am not a gamer so no need for the best/fastest graphics - just want fast performance for my apps and a decent Camera (which this is; and, the one thing I will miss from the 5S is the great camera). But then again, this unit is literally more than three times less than a 5S with 16GB.So, very solid phone. Build is great, feels very ergonomic in the hand and the screen is really fantastic for any phone, let alone a phone that shipped to my door for $199. With T-Mobile HSPA+, I get 8 Mbps to 12 Mbps down and 2 Mbps to 3 Mbps up. This is not LTE but it's plenty fast for ""3G"".I may not have this unit for a year, but I am immensely enjoying it for a $199 phone. The size is perfect (Nexus 5 is bordering on too large) and everything about the Motorola G is, well, great. I am amazed this is unlocked for such a good price. Pair this with T-Mobile's uncarrier plans and I can stream as much video and audio (without a hiccup!) as I want. No limits, no slowdowns. Thanks Moto!

Motorola has some nice features that limits GPS usage and I think this helps quite a bit.  I was upgraded to KitKat shortly after receiving my phone. I did regularly use the NFC on my Nexus but not having it on this phone has not been a big issue. I use this phone for T-Mobile and it works fine. the phone feels heavier than my previous phone but it feels solid and well made.

This sensor inside the phone is the noisiest I have seen...I took online reviews with a grain of salt but after seeing results of indoor shots with and without flash I am beyond disbelief they would put this camera module in a phone.  My LG L9 takes far better photos with less noise and a more natural tone.  I thought this being newer and the same price point it would have at least a similar camera.  The camera flash blows out EVERYTHING within a few feet.  So no flash for indoor shots of your friends.  Without flash they will be noisy, noisy, noisy.

B00GWR36F6,ABDR6IJ93HFIO,"Daisy ""Daisy S""","[5, 5]","This excellent unlocked Moto G LTE Phone has surpassed my expectations! Before I purchased this phone on Amazon, I had a much larger phone the Samsung Galaxy Grand (5 inch display), which was just too large and heavy etc. This Moto G LTE phone is just the right size, not too large or too small! For you the reader, my goal here is to give you everyday and practical uses regarding this phone.PROS:+ Built in slip proof cover - In a sense, the slip proof cover is built into the phone and it so attractive and anti slip on the front and on the back that I did not need to purchase an additional cover to start using the phone. However, I purchased on Amazon a slim cover and a genuine Moto back in a Pinkish Purple and this keeps the phone protected and anti slip etc.+ Screen Resolution - VERY CLEAR! The colors are vivid and the fonts, icons are very clear. Even though this is a  4.5 inch screen, when I view pages on the internet, the text is clear and pictures very clear and colorful! For me, I can read everything well without my reading glasses.-+ Kit Kat / Pure Android Experience - Since this has the pure Android with no overlays over it, and just the essential apps installed, this is a leaner phone that uses much less memory and battery than the ones that have those overlays and are not straight Android! This means that Kit Kat OS runs better and faster also I have found. I know as I own two Samsung tablets with Kit Kat that I love, but they have bloat ware on them, this phone does not).+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD -  For me, I added a 32GB SD card. However, there are those who add a 64gb SD card, and I have heard that these work in this phone. And for the newer updates and new apps that are Kit Kit approved/Kit Kat ready, I was able to move them over to the SD card to save space.+ WiFi Connecting/Speed of WiFi - Very, very fast--in fact in the back of my home, I still get 4.5 bars of WiFi signal on this phone! This I tested using my home router and on the go at many hotspots with WiFi. . Other hotspots: No problems at all connecting and staying connected on these. And I found the speed still high at home with several devices connected to the router, no loss in speed. **Note that I had other phones before this one and for me, none gave me the quick connect and overall speed as this one!+ Internet & Webpage & Video Viewing - The Chrome browser does a great job, however, I use Maxthon Browser with great internet viewing results and it renders webpages quite fast for me.+ LTE is amazing! For me, I use AT&T; and I have noticed that the LTE data is super fast loading webpages, opening emails on this phone --- it is so much faster than in my last phone with just t 3G on it, I can really tell the difference.+  Office Program with the phone - Found it to be OK, but I went to the Playstore and installed Docs to Go (which lets me edit, save, view in MS Office types and also view PDF files). There is also a MS Office App (free) in the Playstore.+ Music Player - This phone comes with Google Player installed and I like it OK. It does play music that is stored on my external SD card nicely and saves new Playlists OK (and Google Player also plays music from the Cloud). However, let me suggest RocketPlayer (free) from the Playstore. I like it because my music is on my external SD card and it plays it in playlists or from my folders etc. I have already created my playlists on it and the sound is superb!+ Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos, however, may I suggest QQ Player (Free App from Playstore and the ONLY one I recommend as it plays every home video I tried).+ Battery Life- Excellent and the best I have found yet! Since this phone does NOT come with lots of bloatware and useless apps, this helps the memory to run better and the battery last longer! In fact, I have gotten a day and a half of battery use (I turn off WiFi when I am off the internet or email etc).  However, I run my brightness at 100%. So on an average day, I get at least a full day with about 15 percent left (sometimes more) and then I charge it overnight.+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.+ OTG - The micro USB port on this phone is OTG (On the Go) compatible, this means that if you order a OTG Adapter Cable, then you can place a flash drive, USB Mouse and more into this phone. For me, I have been able to place my 32GB Flash drive in this adapter and easily copy files from this phone to my flash drive!+  Peppy and fast - Found the response on this phone to be very peppy and fast, no lagging!+ 5MP Camera - For a 5MP, actually I found that my pictures came out clearer and better when I did this:-  I DO NOT USE the AUTO setting, just the flash or no flash and my pictures come out better now. My outdoor pictures I do not take in bright, bright sunlight, I take in shade and my pictures come out better. However, for more serious and highly detailed picture taking, I like to use my regular digital camera.+ File Manager - I went to the Playstore and found Astro File Manager, it is easy to find my files on my SD External card and also on the phone. Liked it so much, I bought the AD FREE version!**Notes regarding the camera: I found that if I leave my flash either on or off (and do not set to AUTO), the pictures have come out so much better now (clearer with better color etc). I took some outdoor shots and indoor shots after this and found that my pictures really looked nice!CONS:- New Adobe Flash is not supported; however, I found that archived flash (which I installed) gets some online videos to play. So I downloaded the older archived flash which gives me the ability to view many internet videos (I use Maxthon Browser and have had good results, however, I could not get Amazon videos to play).Bottom line: Would I buy this phone over again? Yes I certainly would buy this exceptional phone all over again. If you are looking for a easy to use and reasonably priced Android smartphone that has wonderful battery life, let me suggest this phone to you.

Yanes ""ChowKaiDeng""","[1, 1]","Both my wife and I own Nexus 4 and we got a Moto G for our nephew just a few weeks ago, so this review will mostly compare the Moto G againts the Nexus 4.The short story is: If the Moto G would be in existence by the time we got our Nexus 4 about a year ago, I would definitely preferred the Moto G over the Nexus 4. The reason: it's price.DESIGNThe Moto G design, although a little thicker than the Nexus 4, it's absolutely beautiful. Most $200 Android phones feel &#34;cheap&#34; but this is not the case. Materials are great and the curved back it's really great to hold. Buttons (volume rocker and on/off) do a satisfying &#34;click&#34; when they are pressed.Its screen it's a little smaller than the Nexus 4, but that's precisely a plus for me: I have regular-to-small hands and I can't completely reach the other side of the screen with my thumb when holding the Nexus 4. The Moto G feels a lot better in my hand and has a screen big enough to comfortably browse the web, read a book or watch a show.BATTERY LIFE AND PERFORMANCECompared to the Nexus 4, the Moto G battery life is WAY MUCH BETTER: With the Nexus 4, I need to charge my phone every night and sometimes even charging it a little bit via USB while at the office. The Moto G battery can easily reach 2 days without a charge... of course, this depends on how much do you use it, but I'm talking about &#34;normal&#34; use.About the performance, the Moto G does a really impresive job, almost as fast as the Nexus 4 (they both have Quad Core processors, but the Nexus 4 has +1GB RAM). You won't feel any lag, at all, while using this phone.CAMERAFirst, let's be clear about something: both the Nexus 4 and the Moto G have &#34;regular&#34; cameras. They do not have top-notch cameras as other phones. But on the other hand, they are also two of the cheapest (and better built) Android phones in the market. This phones have cameras good enough for everyday use. If you need a really, really, good camera, you could just pay more than three times the price of a Moto G in order to get an iPhone 5S or something like that.That said: The only thing I would prefer of my Nexus 4, it's the camera, which has more manual settings and a better interface than the Moto G. That doesn't mean the Moto G camera is not good: if I had a Moto G, I would definitely and happily live with that camera.PRICEDid I say it already? This phone has the price that a smartphone should have, accesible and proportional to a piece of hardware that we carry in our pockets, everyday, that we can easily drop and brake, and at the end, it will go obsolete and won't be up to date with for the software specs in about 18 to 24 months.If you need a good Android phone that works fast, but you don't have a large bufget to expend, this is definitely your best choice.",5.0,1398297600,"04 24, 2014",Motorola Moto G - Global GSM - Unlocked - 8GB (Black),168.93,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZjdGB55nL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 472},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

B00GWR36F6,A27MX4Y22QZW1N,Etienne,"[7, 7]","I purchased this for my college age daughter to replace a seriously old Samsung Android phone (like v.2.3!).  While she wanted an iPhone, I do not have one for myself, nor am I rich enough to afford four of them for the whole family.  I was resigned to having to purchase another pricey phone with T-Mobile (which, while the coverage is not the best, offers the best family rates going, especially after their latest separation of phones and plans), or a bargain model that I would hear complaints about.  When I read about the Moto G being released and its phenomenally low price, I assumed it would be a dual or single core processor model, with a mediocre screen.  When I read the specs on it, I could not believe Motorola (Google) could offer such a phone for the price.  Either they are losing money or just breaking even (of course, Google's core business is advertising, so they probably are planning on the long term value).  Regardless, the phone is awesome.  Hopefully this will be the future of ""low end"" phones.The screen is large, but not monstrous, ideal for my daughter that definitely did not want a big display phone, but something small and easily handled.  The resolution is ideal and not an overkill 1080p display that taxes the GPU and battery.  The quad core processor gives the phone plenty of pep, although I cannot comment on game play (I don't understand playing games on a phone, given the small display, but that is a personal choice).  The battery is embedded in the device and there is no additional memory card slot for expansion (a Google device habit), so if you plan on having a lot of media and apps, I suggest the 16Gb version (8Gb is fine for her use and I'm cheap!).  If you want to load all your music on it, you better look elsewhere.  I am not sure of how long the battery lasts, but I have not heard a complaint about it yet. The camera seems OK, although I did not play with it that much, and really don't see the need for high resolution camera phones, give the limited sensor area available (get a digital point and shoot, or better yet, a nice used film camera -- I am a diehard fan of film in all its sizes, from 35mm to 4x5!).When first booted up, the phone was ready for Android 4.4, which I suggest using wifi to perform, unless you have unlimited data, speed, and/or patience as it is a big file (this was before adding the sim card, so I did not have it on T-Mobile's network at the time).  A quick restart and the phone was ready to go, using the standard Google logon.  Android on this phone is gloriously free of bloatware (like Samsung and HTC insist on stuffing on their phones), other than probably two apps.  The included Motorola app for transferring settings and files worked perfectly, taking a few minutes to do its thing (you install it on your old phone and connect to the same wifi, following the prompts).  I had to get a micro sim card from T-Mobile, but that was free via mail order (note that it will take prepaid and postpaid sims, defaulting to your plan -- it is just a ""dumb"" sim), or from what I later read, possibly free in retail locations.  I learned about the universal sim card by mistakenly ordering the prepaid for our postpaid plan.  Setting it up was easy on T-Mobile's website, with the phone was switched over within minutes of finalizing online.The only minor negative, is that the phone does not support LTE, but is otherwise 3G, and fast enough in our area. But I knew this when ordering. There have been no complaints about the call quality, either.My daughter seems fine with the phone, including no complaints about performance.  This is a kid that has no trouble of literally letting me know if things ""suck,"" so I consider it an awesome ""bargain"" phone not locked to a carrier.Had this phone been available when I purchased the HTC One, I would have purchased it for myself.  I like the HTC, especially its slightly bigger screen for my slowly decaying eyesight, but the bloatware and cost are not worth it.  I highly recommend the Moto G and look forward to replacing the HTC One with whatever iteration is available when needed.I added the following screen protector to the phone, Archshield - Moto G Premium High Definition (HD) Clear Screen Protector 3-Pack (no longer available on Amazon, thus no link), but suggest another brand, as my installation was troublesome.  If Spigen comes out with screen protectors I recommend them, finding them to be the best available (and the company is quick to reply to inquiries).  The following protective case is recommended, as long as you know the color of the pink version did not quite match that displayed onlineTUDIA Ultra Slim Melody TPU Bumper Protective Case for Motorola Moto G SmartPhone (Pink).One other thing of note forgotten in the initial review:  Before purchase, I read of issues with the back, removable portion of the phone being easily damaged during removal to access the micro sim slot.  Knowing this I was careful to follow the instructions and treat the back gently.  You can see how easy it would be to damage it by bending it a little too far.

B00GWR36F6,A2QI2NTDTMK2FV,Jerry Palmerino Jr,"[2, 2]","Wow!I have more than one phone to stay current with the mobile field.  I had to purchase this out of curiosity.My first impression of this phone was from the box.  The box is smaller than any other phone box I have ever had.  Once unboxed, I was amazed at the heft of this phone.  This is a good thing, as this feels like a solid phone of premium build quality.  It doesn't creak or feel flimsy in any way.  It fits so well in-hand and is very comfortable to hold.  Now I know why so many phone websites talked about how great the Moto X felt in-hand. This phone shares similar design DNA.  It even has the dimple. The build quality is great.  The buttons are clicky and the device feels solid.  It doesn't flex at all.At 4.5 inches in screen size, there was no way to forget that the screen was smaller that my GS4 and HTC One.  Half an inch makes a big difference.  You may enjoy have a 4.5 inch screen if you are coming from a smaller screen, so this is not necessarily a negative.With only 8 GB of space on-board, you definitely need to buy an SD card.  I bought one of the new Samsung's (the orange 32gb card) and it works great.  After installing everything I have ever installed on my other Android phones, I still had 3GB of space left on-board the device itself.  Out of the box, you have approximately 5 GB on-board for all of your apps, music, video, and photos.  This makes the SD card a must.One interesting feature of this phone is the Storage -> Move Media option in Settings.  It is like a broomstick to clean up all of your photos, video, and music and move it to the SD card.  I find this useful because some apps will only write to internal storage, and if they do understand the concept of an SD card, these apps still write to the device's internal storage as an ""emulated SD card.""  I was caught off-guard the first time, thinking I was saving to my SD card, when it was really the ""emulated SD card"" in the phone's storage (not my real physical SD card I put in the phone).  So you will still find yourself needed to use this cleanup option to actually move your content from the emulated SD card to the real SD card.I threw my AT&T; sim card in this phone and LTE works great in it.On Geekbench 3, it scores a 338 on single core and 1137 on multicore.My only disappointments are middle-of-the-road photo quality and that it only supports 2.4Ghz WiFi.  There is no 5GHz band in this phone. You can't have everything in a budget-priced phone I suppose.Overall, this phone is generally by no means a sacrifice in quality or usability.

B00GWR36F6,A2URKEA8DRRF8U,Kendrick Vargas,"[410, 431]","I purchased this for my mom, for a friend, and for a cousin. I have to say I am very impressed with this little device. Just so you know where I'm coming from, my cell phone history starts with my current Nexus 5, Nexus 4, Galaxy S3, Galaxy Nexus, Blaze 4G... and it goes on and on and on. I am a smart phone aficionado, and this little thing impresses me.The screen has great viewing angles, and looks great in general. I dare say I like the color and viewing angles better than on my Nexus 5. The blacks don't become a light grey at the extreme corner angles. Obviously, my 5"" 1080p is more of a pleasure to use than the 4.5"" 720p overall, but I had to comment on just how rich and beautiful the Moto G display is. The size means that it has a PPI of about 329. The iPhone 5's retina display, for comparison, sits at 326ppi. The vast majority of people will need no more than what this display has to offer. And, AND... it's wrapped in Gorilla Glass 3. Not that it should really matter that much, I've had Gorilla Glass scratch and seen it shatter so it isn't a super material... but some people will be glad to have it.The Quad Core 1.2Ghz Snapdragon 400 was fast enough for me. According to some benchmarks I've seen, it supposedly runs about as fast as the Nexus 4. The difference seems to be that this CPU simply sips on the battery. But, I'll get to more on that later. The GPU seemed fast enough for me on the benchmarks I'd run. Not the fastest, but by no means slow. The device doesn't have as much RAM at 1GB as higher end phones which tend to come in at 2GB. However for the average person this will not matter. Android's memory management is pretty good. While a power user might be able to occasionally catch blips associated to the lack of extra ram, the average user will never see it.For a casual user, the battery life will simply be phenomenal. My own mom, with some light-ish use on mostly 3G network access did 21% battery use over 24 hours, and 55% over 3 days before charging. That's just crazy. Simply bananas. As a disclaimer, I bought 4 phones total and ran into a bug on one of my phones (that others have reported as well on some units) where a full discharge of the battery was not able to be recharged from fully dead without some serious fiddling. I managed to get that phone charging again and decided to try and run the battery down (testing) and I ran into problems. I couldn't tax the battery. I ran benchmarks, 3D intensive simulations, etc... the thing would not give up it's battery. I'm returning the questionable phone, but given that there are bad eggs in any production batch, I'm not docking any stars. I think this phone is worth the 5 stars, regardless of the occassional bad build.Cons? There's no ""advanced"" features. There's no LTE (4G) radio on board. There's no NFC sensor for sharing links or doing financial transactions. There's no wireless charging, nor any 802.11ac support for the WiFi. However the average user might not really care about, or need, those things. LTE would've been nice, and most people have been convinced that they need 4G in their lives. However many are reporting real-life 3-4Mb/s transfer rates on their Moto G's... I get 12Mb/s on my DSL. How much speed do you really need to check the weather? I don't see how NFC didn't make the cut, but I guess at the price I can't complain. I'm not wild that the volume rocker is on the same side as the power button, but that's not a big deal.Pros? This phone feels great in the hand. It has a good weight. I never liked the ultra-light feel of the samsung flagship phones. The phone feels solid despite having a user removable back plate. Oh, and you can replace the back plate with colorful replacements, or flip covers, or what have you.For most anyone, this will be an absolutely fantastic choice. Don't be afraid, just buy it.",5.0,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",Motorola Moto G - Global GSM - Unlocked - 8GB (Black),168.93,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZjdGB55nL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 472},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

It's literally falling apart and my T-Mobile contract is almost up so I figured it was time to move into the present day and change phones and companies. I purchased a locked version of this phone through Republic Wireless (they require a proprietary Moto-X or Moto-G which can only be used on their system). I am a VERY happy camper. The current version comes with KitKat (Android version 4.4) which is what I am using right now. With built-in FM radio and GPS, there's a lot of off-line utility with the Moto-G. Even without a cell connection, or wi-fi in the case of Republic, I can still listen to NPR, play some games, and even (with a little foresight) use this for navigation.I've been using Android based tablets for several years now, so for starters I found using the same interface was trivial. I particularly like the physical size of the Moto-G which seems to be hitting a sweet spot. It nestles nicely into my average sized hands, and fits fairly easily into my front jeans pocket (yes, I can tell it's there, but it doesn't stick out).Google owns the manufacturer of this phone, Motorola. It's obvious that Google/Motorola work tightly together. Setting this up with my Google account pretty much was all I had to do. All of my Google contacts were immediately imported into the phone. Very cool. All other Google products work very well on the Moto-G also. The Google Maps app has the ability to import a map for offline use. I tested the offline maps with the built-in GPS and had a very nice, albeit rudimentary, car-based GPS unit. Did I say that was with no wifi or cell connection?The screen is super bright and I've had no issues seeing this except in the total brightest sunlight (and I can still use it - just don't start watching a baseball game at high noon on the beach). One of the features I love is the built in FM radio but you have to attach headphones for an antenna.The only two external controls are the power switch (top right edge small button) and volume up/down button (larger button just below power switch). Simplicity.Oh, just try one out. When I checked things out I figured the Moto-G was good enough for me and a lot cheaper than the Moto-X.

The best phone you can get at this price point (off contract) bar none. I did not experience any issues setting up the phone and using it. I purchased this primarily as a world phone for when I travel overseas. It is perfect for that purpose. Great display, sharp and bright. The processor keeps the phone zipping along quite nicely, I haven't noticed any lag yet. Call quality is very good and WiFi connectivity is also very good. Keep in mind that mine only came with a USB cable for charging and no AC USB power adapter. This was no issue for me since I have plenty from old phones. It is a standard micro USB connector. The picture quality is fair to good but what do you expect for a phone at this price. My only gripe is that the back cover is a bit finicky to remove. Make sure you hold the middle while prying up the BOTTOM of the cover first. If you try to open it from the top (like I did), you will most likely crack the back cover along the tiny strip of plastic around the hole for the headphone jack. I feel like they should have had the back cover go around the headphone jack without the thin strip (so it fits like a U around the jack instead of like an O like it does now).

B00GWR36F6,A35UDCJGVPIPG6,Max Harry Johnson,"[10, 10]","You can read other reviews for details on the Moto G. I will primarily compare the Moto G LTE version with the Moto G (3G) and Moto X in this review.I own all three of the above phones and I chose the Moto G LTE as my daily phone since it have the best compromises out of the three.Features the Moto G LTE have that the Moto G 3G version lacks:-4G LTE of course.-Gyroscope. For example, if you install the Google Camera app, you can take Photosphere photos. The 3G version do not have this feature.-MicroSD support. (PS. It will work with 64gb microSD card formatted as FAT32. If your 64gb microSD is formatted as exFAT, you need to reformat it as FAT32.)Things from the Moto G LTE that I prefer over the Moto X:-Better grip comfort:The Moto G is thicker than the Moto X which is a good thing. The back cover is soft and smooth, and due to the thicker sides and rounder edges it is ergonomic and more comfortable to hold.-Better battery life:While both have LTE, due to difference in screen technology and lower powered CPU, the Moto G tend to get half an hour to one hour of screen on time more than the Moto X.-Stays much cooler:Due to the lower powered CPU and maybe the size, it doesn't get as hot like the Moto X. Even after using the phone in navigation mode for an hour, the phone doesn't get hot enough to become uncomfortable to hold.-Moto G LTE version have microSD support, Moto X don't. It's true Motorola is coming out with a Moto X with 64gb, but its a bit too late and probably more than most want to spend for a phone that is not top of the line anymore.-Better screen details:This will be controversial to some. I actually love the AMOLED screen technology which is used in the Moto X and Samsung phones, due to it's superb 180 degree viewing angle, super deep black, and excellent contrast. However, for a budget phone, the Moto G screen is very acceptable. While the viewing angle for the Moto G's IPS screen isn't very good, it's actually sharper than the Moto X AMOLED screen and have smoother colors (less color banding). It's about same brightness as the Moto X screen.What I felt missing from Moto G:No NFC. This is the only thing that bummed me out about this model and I felt it should have been included at its price point. Lacking NFC takes away some cool and useful features. With NFC you could: pay using Google Wallet, easily transfer contacts or files between Android phones using Android Beam, ability it to use ""Moto Skip"" to unlock your phone, and fast pairing with NFC enabled devices.Of course there are other cool exclusive Moto X features like Touchless Control, Active Display, and quick camera access. However, the Moto G does have a white LED notification light and you can download third party Active Display alternatives.Overall: I recommend spending a little more to get the Moto G LTE version over the 3G version. It holds its own against the Moto X, while not as fast and features-filled, it gets better battery life and includes microSD support, while practically retaining the same size and use comfort. It's a very well rounded phone that run stock Android smoothly and very little bloatwares. The build quality is pretty decent. It have nano coating for water resistant, but I definitely recommend getting a tempered glass screen protector. IMO, the build is as good or better than some other plastic flagship devices (*cough* Galaxy). The battery life is adequate to get you through an entire day. Lastly, being a Motorola phone you know that you'll get good signal and call quality.The weak points of this phone include having an average 5MP camera and not having a highend CPU/GPU package to play heavy graphic games. Those two factors probably aren't vital for the target consumers of this device.  You get about 5.5GB of free space for the internal storage out of the box, but just compliment it with a decent sized microSD card.

Currently owning a Nexus 4, Nexus 5 and Moto X I can say that the Moto G is a mighty fine phone.It doesn't have a hi end camera, it doesn't have NFC or wireless charging. But if you want those you can buy a much higher priced phone? Or pay another two hundred and get a Nexus 5. What the Moto G does give is a good solidly built phone with a good screen. I do wish it came in a 32 gig model, but 16 will do fine for now.Treat your self to one of the flip covers. Yah, they are a bit pricey buy they protect your investments screen and when you close the cover it shuts the phones screen off. Open it and the screen comes back up.For 200.00 I hate using it for work. Not the price mind you but that it is such a nice phone.People who say this is a bad phone while comparing it to the SGS4 or Nexus 5 are missing the point of a comparative review. The Moto G should be compared to other 200.00 dollar phones of comparable specs and relative value.Honestly, I wrote Motorola off more than ten years ago because they had gained a reputation for building CRAP. Even then the last two Motorola's I owned were nightmare's. With Googles purchase of Motorola I decided to give the Moto X a try and was totally blown away by how well it performed in every way. How well built it was and that some one put some thought in to it, rather than just slapping a bunch of hardware in to a phone body and calling it a phone.Needing a new phone for work I decided to give the Moto G a try having been more than happy with the MX. Happily I am not disappointed one bit.Googles presence at Motorola has put Motorola back on the track of excellence. I would not hesitate to recommend this phone to anyone over other phones costing hundreds more. If you need wireless charging, NFC, and a boat of bells and whistles the Nexus 5 or Samsung Galaxy S 4 may be your better options. But if you just need a great phone at a unbelievably low price. Grab the G, You won't be sorry.And as always.

This was a X-mas purchase so these are all her points after she had the device:- HD screen - 720P and great viewing angles for a device at this price point. It's not mind-blowing but at 4.5 inches its a impressive pixel density and very well done. As a side note you might want to up text size as at this pixel density text mighth be smaller than you might be used to coming from a non HD device.- The size, shape and feel of it - It's about a midrange size. Not very thin but not too thick either, it has a good feel in your hand of some heft and feeling well put together. The buttons feel good and the back is a rubberized material that feels good in the hand.- Vanilla android - She came from the Samsung Touchwiz overlay on top of android and swore she would never like plain android. The plain android really surprised her with its simple elegant design and lack of ugly over the top icons or colors or just plain clunkiness.- The Android 4.4.2 update - Basically just turn your phone on you bought from Amazon and the the newest update is all ready to download. Simply do like you would an iOS update and let it update over wifi or mobile if you desire. 4.4 is a vast improvement over 4.3 in terms of smooth functioning and new features- Simple camera interface - You can tap the screen, focus and take a picture and the options are small. Many will like this. if not download one of many different apps.- It's very snappy - Her words. Basically if she wants to do her usual social networking, reading news, or playing a game...its fast and doesn't make you want to pull your hair out. apps open and close in a snap.Here are a few things you should know:1. You just have to update to 4.4.2...its simple, clean, fast, and has many new added features2. There is no NFC for you people out there who want it for paypass, but that's a small sample size. To make up for that and to share pics and videos, just use superbeam from the playstore. It works perfectly.3. You can easily migrate your stuff from your old phone by using the Motorola migrate app. It's fast, easy, and complete. (except music but I prefer to do it separately anyway.4. The camera is very middle of the road but is easy to use and more than great for pictures posted to social networking.5. FM radio is on here and works great. A feature most carrier phones disable.6. There is no LTE but H+ is still more than adequate for what  95% of people need.7. Don't use chrome browser as an indication of the speed of the phone. Firefox and Dolphin are much better and don't lag like Chrome is notorious for.8. There is no external SD card option but you can use a an OTG USB adapter to load content.9. Tethering options are all enabled.10. Miracast options are there as well.To sum it, its a great phone for a great price and you will be amazed how quickly stock android will grow on you.",5.0,1388102400,"12 27, 2013",Motorola Moto G - Global GSM - Unlocked - 8GB (Black),168.93,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZjdGB55nL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 472},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

However, it is lacking a couple of &#34;premium&#34; things from it's big brother that you may or may not need.1: Touchless Controls are AWESOME! But, they aren't included on this device. My tech-illiterate mom never noticed the loss though.2: Moto Assist is &#34;Gimped&#34;, if you will. It doesn't detect your driving, which I found immensely useful on my Moto X. It does behave as expected with meetings and sleeping though!3: Build quality is subjective. That said, the plastics aren't as nice as the Moto X - they collect smudges a lot easier, and the black version never looks clean. That said, it is a very durable finish, as far as I can tell - keys, pavement, and coins didn't really damage it.4: Camera - not as nice. Is it still good? Yup! The photos are clear, provide enough detail, and shoots quickly. It lacks the quick launch capabilities, but the interface is the same.5. Last missing - screen. It's LCD, rather than AMOLED. This can be good, or bad, depending on your preference. I like LCD better, but some folks prefer it the other way around. In comparison to my HTC ONE X, it looks much nicer and more accurate. Colors are less vibrant when compared to the Moto X, however.A few things it does better? Well, not a lot. It's a Moto X with a few compromises. Are they worth the trade off?

I rooted and freezed some apps and processes and is smoother than butter, no lags or stutters whatsoever. It's even smoother than my previous galaxy s4 (broke it's display and couldn't afford another one)Awesome 5 MPX camera with HDR mode plus a front facing camera for video calls.Stylish design, not the usual boring brick. plus you can change the back color.the Snapdragon 400 processor and Adreno 305 graphics chip run every game I throw at them. Asphalt 8, Minion Rush, GT Racing 2, FIFA 14, all of them run super smooth and with great graphics. They can also handle 10 bit encoded 720p videos with stylished fonts with MX Player.2 years of free 65 GB cloud storage.Gorgeous 720p HD screen protected by Gorilla Glass 3, you cant see pixels, has almost perfect RGB gammit, meaning it has very accurate color reproduction. it has a great touch sensitivity too. Oh and the display technology is not TFT as Amazon states, it's IPS which is even better!The battery is phenomenal. I've got up to 6 hours of screen time! You can easily get one or two days of battery before running out of juice if you don't have your phone stuck to your face all day like me.The speakers (both back and call speakers)are extremely loud and have very clear sound.It has USB OTG. I can connect my Moto G to my Pendrive and micro sd card with a USB OTG adapter, I can even use a keyboard and mouse!The nano coating on its internal chips repel water if your Moto G happens to get wet. Rain, your drink spilled on it, dropped it in the toilet? no problem!DISCLAIMER: It's not waterproof, just plash resistant so don't do anything stupid like sinking it in your bathtub or recording video in a pool.

I honestly can't believe how well this headset reduces background noise. When at the gym, I can be directly under a speaker with loud music playing and the person on the other end can't hear any of it; yet they hear me perfectly. The boom works really well too. If you are looking to reduce / eliminate background noise, this is your headset. I also have the Bose 2 which I thought worked well until I tried this one. They aren't even in the same ballpark.It's not the most comfortable headset, and it doesn't sound that great when listening to music (at least compared to the Bose 2).

B00H0CV9WE,A15ML85W54A2AH,Do42,"[9, 9]","I have several HX550 headsets. When the HX600 Boom headset appeared, naturally I was curious if it was better so I bought one. The HX550 was absolutely the best Bluetooth headset that I have ever owned and I've owned several different brands. The ONLY better headset is the Roadking RK400 and it is better ONLY under very windy or noisy conditions. http://amzn.com/B00AC6SAZEI have a convertible car and when riding with the top down the RK400 is better because it has a boom mic that sits very close to your mouth. With the HX's the other party can't hear me very well with the wind blowing on my face. With the RK400, at expressway speeds, the top down and the wind roaring in my face, the other party can hear me perfectly.But other than high speed top down environments, the Motorola HXs win hands down.My big question was ""What is the difference between the HX550 and the Boom HX600?""I made a call and flipped back and forth between headsets to determine the call quality. The voice definitely seemed to be clearer with the 600 on my end. The other party could tell no difference in my voice quality.The 600 is styled slightly different. It's a little sleeker but to be honest, it's not much difference. The 550 has 50% longer battery life. Nine hours for the 550 vs six hours for the 600. The battery life difference is the biggest plus of the 550 and the clearer sound is the biggest plus of the 600. Although the 600 is clearer, the 550 is louder. Listening to an audiobook and alternating between headsets the 550 is definitely MUCH louder. Both charge quickly and I doubt if anyone will run either of these down. Even on the heaviest talk or audio-book listening days, it's difficult to run the 550 down but I've done it a couple of times. So I definitely would have to give the 550 the edge with battery life with the three extra hours of talk time.The actual talk time of the 550 at full volume is closer to seven hours not nine. The nine hours is probably at medium volume. The 600 definitely has a shorter battery life.The 600 has a higher distance range but practically that's not going to make many people any difference. First, you won't need a 300 feet Bluetooth range. Second, you aren't going to get it anyway. Third, if I did have it I wouldn't want that much more power in my ear. The 300ft range level emits a MUCH higher RF signal than the 33ft range.I have a Galaxy S5. I walked away from the phone with both headsets and they both cut out at the exact same distance. The 300 feet only applies with Class 1 Bluetooth devices and cell phones are Class 2 with a 33 feet range. You must have BOTH the phone and headset Class 1 to get 300 feet. Some office phones with Bluetooth are Class 1. In an office environment where the desk phone is stationary, then perhaps a 300ft range would be useful but with a cell phone that you carry with you it is unlikely that range would be needed. I believe all cell phones are Class 2, so 33 feet is all that you will get or likely all that you will likely need.Class 1 Bluetooth (300ft) emits 100mW of power whereas Class 2 Bluetooth (33ft) emits 2.5mW. The 300ft range emits 40 times more RF energy in your ear. I simply prefer NOT to have 40 times more radio frequency energy going in my head.Both feel the same in my ear since they both appear to be the same dimensions and weight and they both use the same earpieces.The pluses of the 600:1. Slightly better hearing tone with calls. After using the headset for a week, this is the biggest advantage. With one caller who I often had difficulty understanding what they said with the 550, I had no such problem with the 600. After all, what you use the headset most for is talking on the phone. I actually bought a new 550 and 600 and I've had the 600 for a week and compared it with the new 550 since maybe my old 550s had lost some sound quality. The 600 is definitely clearer on the hearing end (your end) but there is no difference in what the person hears on the other end.2. Sleeker more modern look (slightly)3. 300 ft range IF you have a Class 1 phone.4. When turned on, the voice prompt tells you in hours how much battery time is left in hours.For example, a full charge will say, ""More than six hours of talk time left"" when the headset is turned on.The 550 will speak one of three levels, ""Battery level is high, medium or low.""The hour indication is better, although the 550 still gives you 50% more talk time, you do have a more accurate idea of exactly how much talk time you have with the 600 when you turn it on.5. Has NFC pairing.As far as I'm concerned, this is a needless feature. It may save a few seconds (and only a few seconds) ONE TIME when pairing with a NFC enabled phone BUT you do have to make sure that you have NFC enabled on the phone. If you have to enable NFC, that takes more time than regular pairing so you really save no time or ease.The minuses of the 600:1. Six hour vs. nine hour battery life2. Forty times more RF emissions when used with a Class 1 Bluetooth phone or device3. More expensive4. Not as loud as the 550You will be very happy with either headset.UPDATE: After a month, I still like this headset over the 550 BUT the battery life is definitely considerably less. I've run dead several times and that literally never happened with the 550. So if you talk or listen a lot during the day then you will notice the significant battery life difference. The good thing is that a 15 minute charge takes the talktime back up to more than 3 hours.",5.0,1400716800,"05 22, 2014",Motorola Boom HX600 Universal Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,43.75,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/316q1EPM5iL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 7197},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"

This one does not do as good a job IMO.The 600 connected fine, at first... but,The 550 had better range and never disconnected from my iPhone. Unfortunately, the 600 disconnects and does not alert you it has done so, resulting in missed calls, texts and so on. I am also finding people I talk to asking me to ""please can you repeat that"".It's just ok IMO.The functionality make it a nice unit, but all functionality is useless if the unit quits after two months. The ear piece broke within a week too.EDIT: JUNE 19th (purchased April 5th same year).The past couple of days, all the people I have called say it sounds like I'm talking into a sponge or with my head in a pillow. Tried my old Samsung HM1700, and while the sound quality is not so great, no one is complaining now.I just called Motorola's listed number to call for warranty and after 37mins on hold, and repeated messages saying I was next in line or something, I gave up.Very poor product quality and even poorer service so far.EDIT: June 20th. So, to be sure I was on the right path, I called again today while I had some time I could sit by the phone again. After 1hour and 12 minutes on hold, I was summarily cut off.NUMBER CALLED (FROM THEIR BOOKLET under how to receive warranty service) was: 1-800-331-6456 (USA).I have more concerns than simply the working of the item....

Gave up on BT headsets because technology was lacking (unclear, gets disconnected, pairing issues, etc).  I will say that the best BT headset that I had was the borg looking Plantronics Voyager 510.Well I just bought the Plantronics M55 (per online reviews as one of Editor's Best), used it for a week, and I have to say it falls short.  Not loud enough on the road, people say treble too high and noise cancellation is overcompensating.  Fit was also just so-so without the earloop.  Felt loose and not secure.So I just picked this Motorola HX600 headset from BestBuy (matched to Amazon) so I could try and return if I didn't like it.  Let me say it's a keeper!  Drove on the 405 freeway today while talking to my wife and she says it's much better than the M55.  She says it sounds fuller and clearer.  I can also hear her and others LOUD and CLEAR.  Quality of build and audio are superior.Fit is also great with 2 ear gels and 2 ear loop options.  I don't like earloops so I am just using the smaller ear gel and it's comfy and fits in place and it doesn't move - feels secure.I am pairing the HX600 (and M55) with a Moto X if that makes a difference.  Because Moto X and HX600 are both from Motorola, I like the way the buttons are setup that just make it run seamlessly.  Like what?Google/Motorla Voice Command:M55 - I had to hold talk button down and when voice prompt came up it didn't pick up my voice well and would often fail to dial the right person or catch what I'm saying.  It's possible that the compatibility didn't allow for M55 to work as mic for voice command and maybe it was picking my voice up on the phone mic.HX600 - One tap and it brings up voice command.  Catches my voice on normal volume so I can speak normally and it gets it right!I have to say that this headset puts it in a good running against higher end models and that tech review sites need to add this to Editor's Best Pick!  You won't be disappointed.My only con is that I wish there was an easy on/off switch vs flipping the boom.  feel it might break over time.  I think I might just leave it on all the time.",5.0,1402531200,"06 12, 2014",Motorola Boom HX600 Universal Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,43.75,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/316q1EPM5iL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 7197},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"

B00H0CV9WE,A3KTBO331WFHW2,"Norita ""The Painter""","[9, 11]","I thought I would not be able to get a good replacement for my recently lost Plantronics Voyager 520, which I had for a three years.First, I got another Plantronics, in bulk packaging, which I thought would be new, but the Limited Warranty said was refurbished.  The actual problem was not so much that it was refurbished, but that it would not pair to my Samsung Galaxy S3.  So I returned it.Then, I thought it would be best to get a Samsung earphone (HM6450 Stereo Bluetooth Wireless Headset) to make sure it talked to my Samsung smartphone, but it was the flimsiest earphone ever!  and then it started not connecting more and more often to my phone.  A wasted $32 (see my review).So after almost giving up on earphones, and thinking that maybe it was the phone that was acting up losing connectivity, I was at BestBuy and saw the Motorola Boom on sale for $49.99.  I checked Amazon and the price was $52, so I decided to give it a try.This little earphone is great.  It was easy to connect, it detects immediately when the Bluetooth is not on at the smartphone, it has a very good, long-lasting battery (which life you are told whenever you turn the device on), the sound is also very good, and it is extremely comfortable in my ear.I am very satisfied so far.  It was worth paying $20 more than the previous awful Samsung product (for which I cannot get a refund).",5.0,1391212800,"02 1, 2014",Motorola Boom HX600 Universal Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,43.75,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/316q1EPM5iL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 7197},Motorola,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"
