B0009SHMUY,ADLVFFE4VBT8,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[43, 43]","BRIEFLY:This inexpensive wire allows for easy transfer of media files - photos, DRM-free music, videos, etc. between a Sony Ericsson phone and any computer that has a USB port.It is very useful for phone users such as myself who are only interested in a 'phone calls only' plan and are not willing to pay the phone company some extra monthly charge for Internet service.It is needed because the Sony Ericsson phones do NOT support a standard USB interface so a 'normal' USB cable will not work._______________________________________EXTENDED DISCUSSION:I'm not surprised my wife's Sony Ericsson's TM506 came without a USB interface wire. It was a 'free' phone and the phone company wished they could nickel and dime us forever through their 'plans' and and make us pay various monthly service fees for the privilege of downloading a couple of songs or uploading photos or videos we made using the phone's camera. The Sony Ericsson's phones lacking a standard USB interface is probably intimidating enough to persuade most users to succumb to the phone company's demand of an extra $10 or more per month for 'web' access. But it does not need to be this way.Since we only wanted a phone that made phone calls this inexpensive wire allows us to squeeze some extra functionality off our free phone by allowing us to transfer media files in and out of the phone by connecting it to a computer. It's easy, it requires no software installation and we don't need to pay one extra dime to the phone company for the privilege.Positives:- eliminates the need to pay the phone company for an Internet connection- no software installation required- file transfer is actually faster- allows for easy media files transfer to and from OUR computer - all DRM-free files can be easily send to the phone- even users who have an Internet plan may appreciate the ability to connect their phone directly to their computerConcerns:- some minimal computer skills are expected - such as the ability to recognize specific file types and copy or move them to/from specific foldersConclusion: recommended to any Sony Ericsson phone user, with or without a media or Internet plan.",5.0,1247702400,"07 16, 2009",Sony Ericsson USB Cable,5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21KnZpm-XPL.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 25391},Sony,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Data Cables']]"

B0042R81XU,APTPMH3LWI1CZ,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","I was slightly skeptical about this purchase in the beginning but I don't regret it at all now.The design of this earpiece is very nice.  It stays stable in your ear very nicely and is surprisingly very comfortable.  I've tested it out by wearing it for approximately 6 hours straight and it only bothered me a tiny bit at that point.  I've had three earpieces for phones and gaming in the past few years and this one is by far the most comfortable for the price.  It displays when it's connected to your PS3 and when you mute, un-mute, or change the volume...which is nice feature.  It also comes with a little USB charging cradle when it's not in use.The only thing I was having problems with is being able to adjust the microphone volume.  Sometimes it won't let me set it above level 3.  I haven't searched for a fix to this or to see if there is one.  At the same time I haven't had anyone complain about being able to hear me either.If you're looking for a decently price earpiece for your PS3 or Vita...or anything else for that matter, this is a sleek looking cost efficient buy!",4.0,1376265600,"08 12, 2013",PS3 Bluetooth Headset,34.5,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41U89kJIUDL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2365},Sony,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"
B0042R81XU,AK0CENM3LUM28,Amazon Customer,"[7, 8]","PS3 Bluetooth Headset / B0042R81XUI bought this to be able to hear game sounds while my husband sleeps; we have a ""proper"" full-sized PS3 headset that plays game sounds, but it weighs fully one hundred pounds and hurts my neck to wear. I noticed several reviews lauding this headset as great for ""night play"". However, it turns out that this headset is ONLY for online chat -- you can hear yourself and others speak through it, but no game sounds whatsoever will come through. I wish the current marketing blurb would actually make that clear; maybe they'll update it soon.So, to be very clear: This is *not* a PS3 headset in the sense that you can hear games. It only allows you to hear other players. If that's what you want it for, it works fine. (Though it is a little big to fit comfortably on smaller ears. And I didn't even know that my ears were particularly small! But this headset is a bit too big for me.) I am leaving this review not to ""trash"" this product, but to help other buyers since the product blurb is ambiguous about this limitation (at the time of writing). I would prefer to leave no stars, but Amazon doesn't provide that option.~ Ana MardollETA: I note that this review has already attracted negative attention. I wish to underscore that I am leaving this review entirely to help inform other customers, with no personal animus towards the manufacturer. Please note that just because the Amazon description says ""voice chat only"" on one day doesn't mean that description was the same when I left the review or will be the same next week; Amazon descriptions can change frequently.I would prefer to leave a ""star-less"" rating, but since I have to leave a star-rating and since the device was uncomfortable to wear AND not accurately described at date of purchase, I have left 2-stars in order to inform other potential buyers. As the product has 500+ 5-star ratings already, this will not hurt the overall average rating, but will make it easier for shoppers to locate and understand drawbacks/limitations when making their purchasing decision.Thank you.",2.0,1382832000,"10 27, 2013",PS3 Bluetooth Headset,34.5,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41U89kJIUDL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2365},Sony,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

It feels kinda awkward, Like the headset isn't all the way in your ear. The lack of noise cancellation lets everything in, so you'll have to be in a really quite surrounding in order to the enjoy them fully. But the biggest reason I say not to buy this is the price. Under $40 may not seem like a lot for a Bluetooth to some, but at the price range you could get some much better ones.

I bought it when this version just came out, at about $60.I bought this to replace my older bluetooth headset that I primarily used on my PS3. When I first saw this, I thought it looked decent, and I thought the stand was pretty neat as well. And at $60, I didn't think that was too bad.So, I've had this for probably about a year now, and its still great. When I first used this guy, I thought that voices were clearer for me to hear, and they sounded much better, although a little on the quiet side. Friends told me I ever sounded better and much clearer (not to imply that my previous headset was junk either). This headset is pretty great, especially as an upgrade to my 2+ year old headset.My only complaint is volume on the other end. When my friends talk, it always sounds pretty quiet. If I ask them to speak up, its better, but if I'm not in a quiet room to start, its not super easy to hear what they are saying very clearly. I don't know if this is due to my settings, their settings, or its just the headset, but it would be nice if it was louder.Overall, a great headset, and a steal at $30!",4.0,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",PS3 Bluetooth Headset,34.5,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41U89kJIUDL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2365},Sony,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

The bonus is that they sound great too.  We use these on our bike rides and leave them in the entire ride.One negative to these is that on the pair we bought, the microphone has a slight rattle when on phone calls.  It sounds like the little buttons in the microphone piece for + and - volume is actually rattling and the mic picks it up as a static type of noise.  If you sit still at a desk for example it isn't a problem but using the mic on our pair causes this noise.

B006K5576Q,AIFLY2HF8NS8U,Andre Lawrence,"[46, 57]","A Very, Very Tough Sell.  Sony Wireless Headset #XBA-BT75:  A Critical Review.This would be a very tough sell even it went for half price at $150.There are several major things wrong with this headset, not the least of which is price.The set comes with:Wireless Bluetooth headpieceAdditional ear budsHard case/ charging moduleCushioned carrying caseUSB to Micro USB plug***Sony is headed in the right direction by focusing its energies in wireless Headset technology, however Sony made some very, very costly mistakes with this product.First there's only one way to charge this Bluetooth headset and that's by a proprietary docking case.  The earpiece sits inside the module where connectors initiate the charge.  On the outer cover, a micro usb to usb plug connects to a computer.In the event that you misplace, lose, damage this docking station, the headset is no good by itself and has no other way to function without replacing that unit.  Sony has been playing these same games with many of their phones.  If you don't have that specific charge cord that Sony, alone, designs then you're out of luck.So, to get around this inconvenience, I brought along with me on a day out, a usb-ac adapter from another device I own.This charge module has a rechargeable battery installed in case your out and you need a charge, but anyone who has those rechargeable batteries knows that the charge doesn't last.  It's nowhere near the capacity of an alkaline battery.*** The Fit ***The headset is constructed with what seems to be a durable, but hard plastic casing.  It took about a week to get use to the feel.The connection cord between the left and right earpiece is very sensitive to touch.  If this cord brushes up against any garment of clothing, it will amplify that vibration on top of the streaming audio or your conversation.*** Connection ***The device automatically connected to my smartphone but it doesn't have an audible monitor built-in to tell when a call comes in, how much charge the battery has or is left.  A small indicator light on the earpiece, out of sight while wearing the device is the only warning system.  It's both impractical and a design flaw to expect the wearer to spontaneously take off the earpiece to count some flashing lights to determine battery strength.And, as stated on the box, the battery life is roughly 3.5 hours between re-charging.  I found this to be accurate.  But, two other wireless, stereo Bluetooth headsetsMotorola 89553N SF600 Wireless Sports Headphones - Retail Packaging - BlackandJabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Black/Yellowboth offer equal or better performance and are less than half the price of these Sony's.*** Call reception ***The biggest problem.  Call after call, both sides of the call had a VERY difficult time hearing each other: indoors and outside.  I was surprised how bad it was.  My 5-mile walk, aka ""test route"" proved to be a disaster for conversations.  This was never a problem for the Motorola or the Jabra.*** Streaming ***The main selling point is unquestionably the audio fidelity by way of the ""Dual Armature', separate microprocessors in the earpieces.Audibly-wise: the fidelity was nice.  Various kinds of music sounded noticeably clean when compared to hearing it out my computer or smartphone speakers, but it was bit more robust than the Jabra and only marginally better than the Motorola.If you're listening to streaming audio, especially at a max. 2 Mbps, you're NOT dealing with ""high fidelity"" from sources like Pandora, Amazon's or even iTunes.  These audio storehouses have to use various file compression format in order to be able to send those files wirelessly.  There's no comparison to a cd and certainly nothing to compared to DVD-audio or SACD.So, the only benefit of this set is to have an external source playing audio through a device that has a bluetooth transmitter.Now, does this last set-up justify the $300 price tag alone?*** Comparison. ****PriceJabra ""Sport""-- Great.Motorola SF600-- GoodSony-- Poor.Call ReceptionJabra-- ExcellentMotorola-- Very goodSony-- Poor.Audio fidelitySony-- Excellent, especially on HQ and home theater setupMotorola- Very good.Jabra-- Good.Battery lifeJabra-- 6 hoursMotorola-- 5+ hoursSony-- 3.5 hoursComfortMotorola-- very comfortableJabra-- comfortableSony-- take some getting use to.Noise interferenceJabra-- noneMotorola-- barely perceptableSony-- horrendous.Sony BT75 is a rushed-to-the-market device.

TheJabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Black/Yellowwould be a competitor in this regard, except that the Sony's sound isolation is far superior, and so requires less volume. TheMotorola SF600 Wireless Sports Headphones - Retail Packaging - Blackhas good sound isolation, but is bulkier.The sound is excellent, except for very minor distortion on bass at max volume, which you probably won't need due to the great sound isolation. You can listen to a Gregorian chant on the subway with no problem.Call quality: nothing of note, on par with other bluetooth sets.Controls are multi-function, to fit the small form. Pairing, power, and call answer are on the same button. Pairing with an iPhone 4 was super-easy.Volume/rewind/fast-forward control and phone mic on the cord. The fit: stays well in the ear, but the cord is a little long, and could sneak into your collar. I will say that it seems a little strange having the volume/rewind/fast-forward control behind your neck, although you actually can wear these earsets upside-down and have the cord under your chin. UPDATE: I have just been informed that this is the way they're supposed to be worn. Heh.One of the distinguishing features is, of course, the charging case. It doubles as a battery, so it extends your playtime, supposedly by up to 3/5 hours more. This solves a major complaint about most bluetooth earphones, although you'll have to carry the case around. Speaking of which, you'll have some fun trying to figure out how to actually fit the charger and cable into the strangely-designed carrying pouch. And it would have been nice if they included a plug-in charger instead of just a USB cable.So, complaints are minimal, except for the hefty price. If you want great sound and sound isolation and a small form factor, plus a charging case, this is it. If you can do with less playtime, and don't mind the added bulk, the SF600 may do, or something like thePlantronics BackBeat Go Bluetooth Wireless Stereo Headset for Mobile, Music and Media - US Warranty - Black, at about $100.Pros:Great soundGreat sound isolationCharging caseSmall sizeFewer, multifunction controlsCarrying pouchCons:PriceLongish cableVolume/playback controls behind neckStrange pouch design",5.0,1336608000,"05 10, 2012",Sony XBABT75 Balanced Armature Bluetooth In-Ear Headphones (Discontinued by Manufacturer),88.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41OxOPlnHfL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 38213},Sony,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"

At the moment I have wireless cans from AKG, as well as wired phones from Shure, Beyerdynamic and Denon in rotation. Even compared to these great full size phones, these little guys do not make me wince, they make me smile.The bass is a little weak with the stock tips, but otherwise the sound is good- open and extended.. I would estimate that you can be about 15-20 feet from your music source under most conditions. I can leave my phone on my deck and go into my kitchen and still get signal. I am finding that I have to pair the BT-75 each time I turn it on - this has happened both with a Galaxy Note 2 and an ASUS Transformer Prime. My BT device sees it but it does not connect automatically, like a bluetooth mouse or keyboard. This is a bit of a pain. Not exactly sure what I am doing wrong, if anything,The other pain is the charging case. I wish they had just included a regular Micro USB type charger, with whatever regulation circuitry was necessary to work with these phones. I suppose the reason for the case  is that the battery life needs to be extended for travel, but I would not use these on a plane. I think they are great for walking around town, in the subway, etc.. I do not find them secure enough in the ears to use them for strenuous exercise.I would view these as a transitional product, and a step towards the great BT earbuds will be wearing in a few years when all the kinks are worked out. In the mean time these provide a more than satisfactory experience.

B006K5576Q,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,J. B. Hoyos,"[1, 2]","I am a music lover who is always listening to songs via my Apple iPhone 4.  Therefore, I have embarked on a journey in search of the best Bluetooth headset.  The Sony XBA-BT75 Balanced Armature Bluetooth Headset has been part of my life for eight months and it is the best Bluetooth headset I have owned to this date.  Whether I am listening to music, watching a video, or making a long distance call, the sound is always clear and crisp.  Until I can find a better Bluetooth headset, the Sony XBA-BT75 will remain an essential part of my life.The Sony XBA-BT75 was easily paired with my iPhone 4 and it has remained paired, unlike my Jabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset (Jabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Black/Yellow).  Also, I can wear the Sony XBA-BT75 anywhere, indoors or outdoors, and always hear my music.  This was not true with the Jabra Sport.  Whenever I was walking or jogging outdoors, the reception was atrocious; it was nerve wracking.  The Jabra Sport only gave me good reception when I was wearing it inside my apartment, in my car or at the gym.  However, I often used its FM radio while walking outside.  Unfortunately, the Sony XBA-BT75 doesn't have a radio.  I do miss that.Furthermore, when I am in the great outdoors, I can wear my iPhone 4 on any part of my body and still hear my music loud and clear.  In fact, I can keep my iPhone inside my backpack and enjoy the music.  The reception is awesome.  At the tennis courts inside my gated apartment complex, I often walk/jog around the courts while carrying dumb bells and listening to my music.  I can keep my iPhone inside its carrying case and hang it over a net while I walk/jog around the courts' perimeter.  Also, I can place the iPhone on the desk in my apartment's bedroom and squat down in the stairwell at the farthermost end and still have reception even though it may not be the greatest because of the numerous, interfering walls.  However, what is really impressive is that I can leave my car, close the driver's door and pump gas while still listening to my music.  I definitely couldn't do this with the Jabra Sport.I have exercised on the elliptical machines in my apartment's gym while wearing the Sony XBA-BT75.  I love these exercise machines because they have LCD screens and docking stations for my iPhone 4; while exercising, I can watch movies I've purchased from the Apple iStore and downloaded to my iPhone.  I can listen/watch movies when I wash dishes, clean my apartment, pay bills, etc., provided that I am wearing my Sony XBA-BT75.  Note:  My iPhone is inside a Speck CandyShell View Phone Case (Speck CandyShell View Phone Case for iPhone 4, Fits Verizon and AT&T; Models - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Batwing Black), which has a fold-back kickstand, which makes viewing movies easy; however, this case, which is very strong and durable, is extremely difficult to remove.The Sony XBA-BT75 came with three sets of hybrid silicone ear buds in small, medium and large sizes.  I never removed the one that arrived already installed.  I believe it is the medium size.  This size fits comfortably in my ear.  My ears have never hurt from wearing this headset, unlike others.  Also, removing the ear buds ruins their integrity, making it easier for them to accidentally come off in the future.  Normally, the ear buds on other headsets begin coming off after a few months of constant wearing.  I've worn this pair faithfully for eight months and the ear buds have never come off once.There are several drawbacks with the Sony XBA-BT75.  Let me begin with the major one.  The right armature often comes out of my ear, especially when I suddenly turn my head.  The cord connecting the two armatures is too long.  It sometimes becomes entangled around my neck and, if I'm sweaty, will cling to it.  This results in the right armature pulling out of my ear.  Furthermore, the voice control mechanism, which is located near the right armature, may contribute to an imbalance in weight.  The voice control is how I know which armature is inserted into my right ear.The carrying pouch for protecting the Sony XBA-BT75 is flimsy; I never use it.  Good luck in following the directions.  Fitting everything inside the pouch was impossible.  Also, I never take the portable charging station with me, which is suppose to charge the headset for an additional 3.5 hours.  I keep the headset inside the charging station while charging it using the USB cord.  However, I don't connect the USB cord to my computer; I use my Philips SPS6038A/17 Home Charging Station.  (I only have two USB ports on my computer and they are usually occupied.)  I wish the Sony XBA-BT75 had come with a wall charger.  Before I received my Philips Charging Station, I nearly purchased the Sony ACU501AD Super Compact 5W USB Charger for Walkman or iPod MP3 players (Sony ACU501AD Super Compact 5W USB Charger for Walkman or iPod MP3 players).  My Jabra Sport came with a wall charger.Furthermore, I had to develop a habit of charging my Sony XBA-BT75 every two or three days.  I was always finding it dead.  My Jabra Sport gave me human voice warnings when the battery was low and needed charging.  The owner of the Sony XBA-BT75 has to rely on flashing lights to indicate if the battery is low.  Who has time to look at lights and interpret their flashes?  Overall, however, I like my Sony XBA-BT75 Balanced Armature Bluetooth Headset much better than the Jabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset mainly because I can use it in the great outdoors.  However, given its hefty price, the owner would expect improved means for transporting and charging it.  Human voice commands would be a nice addition; the owner wouldn't have to rely on lights and sounds.  My search for the best wireless Bluetooth stereo headset must continue.Joseph B.

I have a collection of bluetooth headsets, both headband and ear bud style, and I have to say right out of the gate, this headset is the best I've experienced so far. This is my first Sony headset but previously Jabra has been my hands down favorite for bluetooth headset quality. I've also tried Sennheiser, Creative, Philips and Motorola. They are ALL blown out of the water by the Sony XBA-BT75.The sound quality is amazing. It is full and beautiful. I'm no audiophile, but when I listen to my music through a good set like this, the music feels like it's within me. Yes, it is that good. And what good is beautiful sound like that if you can't HEAR it? No problem with this set. When walking to my car downtown, the noise of traffic and horns drowns out even the highest quality headset. But with the XBA-BT75 I can turn the volume up enough to truly drown out the sounds around me. I never knew what I was missing until I experienced this headset. Even riding the train made it near impossible to listen to podcasts and audiobooks. No more! Thank you, Sony!This little set also boasts a really nice set of features. Three buttons control all the features and they are all easily accessible. I've had headsets where I've had to dig the headset into the side of my skull to find and push a button. The volume up/down buttons are also the next/previous track and ff/rev buttons and the power button doubles as the call answer button. I also love the charging case. I hadn't seen one of these since my old old Samsung bluetooth ear bud. It's very nice to be able to charge the headset on the go without any cables. Once the case is drained, you can plug it in to resume charging but it's more than enough to last me several days on the battery alone.Comfort is superb as well. The set is so light and so minimal that I instantly forget that I have them on. They are quite small so they aren't very noticeable either. Some sets I have are equipped with huge ear pieces that stick out like a sore thumb and aren't exactly comfortable either. You couldn't lay down on your side and fall asleep with these on, but in all other circumstances they feel great.Overall I believe this is the best combination of quality and features I have yet to enjoy in a bluetooth headset.

B006K5576Q,AQIJ3ZEEVCIKU,Kaio,"[18, 18]","I seriously questioned the price point of this Sony headset, and all the hype touting the advanced technology offering a superior listening experience. I watched the videos and read the in-depth product description here on Amazon, admittedly with a tad of cynicism. After all, it wouldn't be the first time a manufacturer over-hyped their design team's talking points. As it turns out, there may be something to it. I have tried MANY bluetooth headsets, and this XBA-BT75 is BY FAR the best with regard to audio quality when listening to music.A First: I Actually Had to Turn the Volume DOWN!I like to play my music loud. I also like audiobooks, which can be hard to hear at times. Anyone who has bought a headset of any brand in the past 10 years, has probably noticed that the volume on most of them doesn't go remotely loud enough. No, I'm not talking concert level decibels -- I mean no headset I've personally tried had enough gusto to block ambient noise and pump enough volume to be reasonably heard. This is especially true when listening to audiobooks in noisy environments, like a gym, or waiting for the bus as traffic whizzes by. Normally, I boost my tracks a few decibels with an audio program, but that can be time consuming. Then I found a cool app called Volume+ that I use on my android phone and tablet -- it automatically boosts the audio up to 20 decibels. Most headsets I've tried get shoddy at a 5 decibel boost. But this Sony BT75 held it together, even at full throttle of a 20 decibel boost; that's when my head started pounding, and I opted to drop it down to a more reasonable 10 decibel boost! Whew!My Unscientific Field TestMy version of putting this Sony BT75 through its paces, was testing the high register with my favorite Native American flutist, Scott August, and checking out how the fidelity holds up while grooving to Michael Jackson. And I have to say, I'm impressed. The clarity and range was great, and I quickly got lost in the music and forgot I was theoretically putting a headset through its paces.Great FitThis is where a lot of headsets fall by the wayside. The Motorola S9 is a pain, because the wrap-around band is constantly hitting something and knocking the headsets off my ears. My Plantronics BackBeats lost their fit over time, and wouldn't stay in my ears. Arguably the best fit for me has been my Jabra Sport, which comfortably wrap-around my ears, have a thin pliable cable and can even be worn while dozing and lying on your ear. These Sonys wouldn't be very comfortable if you rested your ears against a pillow or sofa, and the cord joining the ear buds isn't as thin and pliable as the Jabra Sport. But they do plug my ears like a soft silicone cork, and block out most of the ambient noise in and of themselves. I've got my air conditioner running right now, but when I plug these Sonys into my ears, all I hear is my own voice muffled in my head. And that's without even turning the music on. Listening to MJ's vocals intimately enough to hear his voice echo and his lungs fill with air, adds a whole new dimension of enjoyment to listening to his music. On top of that, I swear I can almost hear Scott August's finger tips gently dancing between the holes on his flute!Cool Charging Case - Wave of the Future? Hope so!Cell phone manufacturers could learn a little something about Sony's innovative charging/carrying case -- I hate all these new 'smart' phones that do basically everything you could want, but only do it for 2 hours before the battery chokes under normal use. I see nothing smart in that; but those techorexic phones sure do look pretty sitting on your desk, drained and useless. I'll take a chubby extended battery with 24hrs of juice any day of the week; if only cell phone manufacturers were as smart as Sony to create an all-in-one charging/carrying case like the ones for these headphones... but I digress... Form follows function with the nifty little case for this BT75 -- the headsets fit snugly into it for charging, and the case has a battery of its own that can charge the headset on the go; or connect both via the micro USB cable and charge both the headset and the case at the same time. Smart thinking, Sony.Large LED's Are Just Stupid... thankfully, Sony is the latest manufacturer smart enough to put a small, understated LED on this headset. With all my little gadgets, and life support systems, I already look like I'm landing from the mother ship! I don't need a huge glowing LED on my bluetooth headset saying ""Hey! Look at ME! I'm cool, 'cause I listen to my music wirelessly!"" The LED on this Sony is plenty big to get the visual cues needed. It's also a nice touch that Sony put a shiny thin red racing stripe on the right ear bud, so it's easy to tell it apart from the lefty.Multi-Touch ControlsLess is more, and Sony smartly combined functions amongst 3 physical buttons. The power button is also the call answer button & the pairing button, and the volume up and down buttons also double as the fast forward/reverse and next/previous track buttons. I hate it when there's too many buttons to keep track of. With these Sonys, at least if I forget how to do something, I only have to start pawing at 3 buttons to figure it out and make something go. I'm more than technically competent; I just don't think every little device is important enough to merit a learning curve.Ear Hangers Could Be Designed a Bit BetterIf this headset has a flaw, it's that the cable connecting the ear buds is too stiff in some respects, and not moldable enough in others. In theory, the wire is supposed to bend around each ear, to create a loop that helps hold the ear buds in place. The problem is, the cord won't lay right between my glasses and my hair that's getting a bit too scraggly. This is where the Jabra Sport fits a little better, but the sound isn't anywhere near as good. And the part of the cord that goes around the back of my neck isn't as pliable as the Jabra's, which adds to the cord not resting in place properly. However, this is a minor inconvenience, since the ear buds stay in my ears rock solid.Call QualityYes, call audio plays in both earbuds. I would say these Sony's are on par with my other stereo headsets, with regard to cell phone calls. I think Sony spent their innovation on the music side of things, and didn't break any new ground as far as how well these double for phone calls. As it is, they're adequate, but nothing better or worse than any other headset I've got.Bluetooth RangeIs quite good. I haven't exactly pushed the 30 foot range, but this Sony hasn't experienced any drop-outs for me as yet. And the wireless connection has been rock solid.Names MatterIt's a personal pet peeve -- I'm not fond of devices that don't have a readily obvious name. Acronyms may have a pragmatic use for a product's engineering department, but it makes it much more difficult for a consumer to tell a friend about a great new tech device they've found. XBA-BT75 simply doesn't do this product justice. It needs a name. But sometimes, manufacturers' creativity stops short in the naming department.Bottom LineOverall, this Sony BT75 is quite impressive. I'd go so far to say that it's the first true audiophile bluetooth headset I've personally encountered; particularly impressive given the compact size. And while I still believe the cost is edging on exorbitant, this may well be a good example that sometimes you really do get what you pay for. The somewhat awkward cord connecting the left and right ear-buds has me on the fence on if this is a 4 or 5 star headset, but overall, the music quality is so good, and the charging system is so innovative, I think docking 1 star for the cord would be unfair. So, all things considered, this is a 5 star headset for me.",5.0,1335225600,"04 24, 2012",Sony XBABT75 Balanced Armature Bluetooth In-Ear Headphones (Discontinued by Manufacturer),88.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41OxOPlnHfL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 38213},Sony,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"

The potential was there but it was truly an awful product. Multiple disconnects, awful display, single touch, glitchy apps. So as an admitted Sony fanboy I decided I did not lose my idealism and gave this watch a try.I'll start with looks and style. Only Apple rivals Sony's classy clean looks in my opinion but in this case I have to warn the public that the pictures make the watch look heavy especially the  brushed aluminum on the side of the watch. It looks like heavy metal and the screen looks like hard glass. Neither is the case, at close inspection and feel, it actually feels and looks like plastic. So if you are expecting heavy materials, you will be disappointed. Luckily the watch is still very attractive and certainly gets lots of looks. In the end I preferred the light weight given I would have it on my wrist for long periods of time.The display is much improved. The color is much more vibrant and clear than it's predecessor and the apps look pretty. It's predecessor offered the ability to view pictures, but they were extremely pix elated and barely view able. Now the pics look great on this little screen. It even displays full album art when playing music. Full functionality for music is there to. back forward, volume control. The weather app is simple and pretty. All functional. Love the find my phone feature to. The only problem with this screen is it's extremely difficult to see anything outside when there is nothing but blazing sun. (I live in Arizona). You live in Seattle and you will be in heaven.Overall, love the watch and it connects wonderfully with my Sony S phone. Connection is strong and I honestly have not had an instant of disconnect unless I walked 15 feet away and even then when I got back to range I simply pressed the button and it reconnected itself. Didn't even have to touch the phone. Which makes me wonder why some people were complaining about connections and can only figure my phone is more compatible since it's a sony.I also read complaints about the proprietary power connection. Do I prefer a universal connector? Yes Does it bother me that it's proprietary? not really unless I'm planning on losing it. Not the end of the world. Also read the complaint about the clip. No problems so far. Love the fact I can clip it on my back or wear it as a watch. I also heard a complaint about the watch turning on when it got bumped due to work. This watch should never be worn at a work site involving lots of physical activity that would cause you to bump it on things. This watch is fragile and could easily break or scratch. This watch is more of a casual fashion watch you wear when you go out.Overall love, the product but what keeps me from giving this 5 stars is the price, the materials and the low visibility of screen in the bright sun. If this watch was about 80 bucks, I would  give it a five star rating for sure. All in all, if you have the money, this watch is wonderful.Update 1/11/13: Had the watch for a while now and still performing like a champ. No breaks and had many many compliments on the watch.

B007VG6ZC8,ABKEWGJCEFQ4L,Amazon Customer,"[5, 5]","I was a bit concerned by other reviews stating that:- You couldn't see the time when the watch is not connected to the smartphone. Well, I turn off the bluetooth on my phone (Samsung Note 2) and the clock still works.- You could not see the smartwatch display in the sun. Kind of true if the sunlight directly faces your watch. But I could still see the time and without direct sunlight on the display and outdoors, I was still able to read my notifications.- You couldn't go very far from your phone without losing connection. With my phone, the bluetooth works great. I was still able to command my phone on the first floor with my watch on the second floor with 2 closed doors in between, at least 40 feet.- With a phone that is not a Sony one, you could not answer phone calls from your phone. True but after uninstalling Sony 'Call handling' app and installing 'Call handling Pro' by Nixi.com everything was fixed.Negative sides:- The battery. Using it a lot, it lasted 2 days.- Not completely waterproof. Only splash proof.Nice surprises:- The watch slightly vibrates each time you receive new notifications and displays the message. It's great to have access to all the emails and messages received by your phone. This is one the reasons why I preferred the Smartwatch to the Pebble, which gives access only to the last email (so far).- Some of the apps are pretty impressive, such as VFinder, Watcher or Calendar reminder. Calendar reminder works great with Google calendar. All my appointments are automatically reminded to me. VFinder permits to use your phone as a video surveillance camera. Watcher permits you to take pictures from your phone with your watch. If you lose your phone and if the phone is in the house for example, 'Find phone' will make your phone ring till you can find it. Also, having the watch vibrating when my alarms or countdown go off makes it very convenient.The most impressive app is AppWidgetDisplay by Fumiaki Tokuhisa (tip from Andreas degrd). It allows you to install shortcuts for most of your favorite apps. It works great with the app 'Assistant' by Speaktoit (and with bluetooth headphones) and also with Pandora.So, best gadget!!! Highly recommended!!!Update: The PowerAmp app makes it even better: I can not only control my music (song, volume, forward, backward...) but also listen to my downloaded radio podcasts. :)",5.0,1370736000,"06 9, 2013",Sony SmartWatch US version 1 Android Bluetooth USB Retail Box,77.58,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GqIBW5JHL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3029},Sony,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Smart Watches & Accessories']]"

B007VG6ZC8,A3FFRUDJUNP60G,LexNoir,"[4, 5]","I wanted to love this.  I backed a Pebble Watch on Kickstarter a long time ago.  I got impatient and ordered this Sony to see what I MIGHT expect from my Pebble.  For a minute I thought wow after using the Sony the Pebble can't compare.Why?  For starters it's touchscreen.  It's color and has an established app eco system with some pretty useful apps.  After 48 hours of using it, I couldn't get past how cheap it felt, how ugly it looked, and far it stuck off of my wrist.  It caught EVERYTHING because it sits so high up off of your wrist.I remember one reviewer here stating something about the watch garnering attention, and once he/she saw people looking and pointing at the watch.  I don't doubt they were pointing, but they probably weren't saying ""wow look at that"".  Most likely they were saying ""what the hell is that ugly contraption protruding from his wrist, what a dork"".  Because essentially that's what you look like wearing this thing.What I liked:- Color screen- Touch screen- App eco-system- Responsive- Good battery life- Didn't impact my LG Optimus G (Quad core, 2GB ram, phone).- Bluetooth range was good.What I didn't like:- Ugly as all hell.- Bulky (in that it stuck so far off your wrist you couldn't get it to hide under a dress shirt, and it caught everything).- Feels like it's going to break at any moment.  Cheap plastic, light.- Not waterproof!  WTF?  That's ridiculous in 2013.  Splash resistent?  I wouldn't trust it.  One good storm and it could be ruined.- WEAK vibration, to the point I barely noticed it half the time.- Way too many taps to get to the information you need.- Poor resolution- Uses a clip to attach to the wristband.  Because it sticks so far off you wrist it catches everything I feel like that clip would break eventually.- Nearly unreadable in sunlight.- Cannot tell time without being synced to a phone.- Time doesn't display on face at all times (you can enable that option, but it dramatically reduces battery life).It was at this moment I realized something.  Sony is trying to TOTALLY replicate my phone on my wrist.  That's not really a good idea.  Pebble got it right.  I have a Pebble on my wrist right now.  I need something flat not boxy and not protruding from my wrist.  I need something that gives me at a glance information, I really don't need to swipe, tap, pinch-to-zoom on a watch do I?  I also think for a watch, physical buttons are the way to go.  I think Pebble got it right, don't overload the watch with too much extra nonsense.  Make it useful, not cumbersome.I also think this whole EVERYTHING has to be touchscreen is ridiculous.  I had a Logitech Harmony remote that was FULLY touchscreen.  It sucked.  Somethings deserve buttons.  A remote, a watch, and even car radio/headunits deserve some sort of physical button/knob etc.All in all, the BIGGEST flaw for this watch is it's UGLY, BULKY, CHEAP, CHEESY, and is trying TOO hard.  Just display the text of an email, and text message, GTalk, GVoice, control music, etc.  Don't overload with touch screen navigation.  And PLEASE make it look sexier.  This thing looks like total crap when I'm wearing a Movado on my other wrist.  On a good note you can change the band and it comes with an adapter to do so.If you're thinking about a smartwatch, for now the Pebble is the way to go though even then you might want to wait until they work out the kinks if you're an iPhone user.  Android users should definitely check out the Pebble.  I plan to do a comparison on XDA forums under Smartwatches if you're interested in seeing my comparison of Sony vs the Pebble.  By the way, Pebble isn't perfect and I have a few complaints about that watch too.  But those are minor and pale in comparison.  I also think those issues will be resolved in a firmware update.The Sony watch can do more than a Pebble (at least for now), but I think that's the problem, it's doing too much and not enough of what you want/need/expect a smart watch to do.",2.0,1363219200,"03 14, 2013",Sony SmartWatch US version 1 Android Bluetooth USB Retail Box,77.58,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GqIBW5JHL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3029},Sony,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Smart Watches & Accessories']]"

B007VG6ZC8,A250HHH6LNASFA,"R. Adams ""Ms. Adams""","[8, 10]","I am in love with smartwatches.  I love that manufacturers are finally starting to pick up the pace in producing these devices.  I own a few bluetooth watches already, including the early Sony analog ones.  I wanted to purchase this since its first iteration, the Liveview, but ended up passing on it when all the atrocious reviews on it came out.  When this was announced and showcased at CES 2012, I was very hopeful.  Even then, I waited a few months before finally getting one.  With Kickstarter projects like the Pebble and Cookoo coming out very soon, and me being a backer of both, I wasn't sure I wanted to get this due to the price and so-so reviews.  I'm glad I did it, though.  This is a very capable watch with lots of potential.The size at first seemed of some concern for me; I don't have overly dainty wrists, but I am still a woman and they are still feminine, and I was worried the watch would be too thick and stick out too far from my wrist.  While this isn't something I'd wear in a professional setting or on a night out on the town, this makes for a casual weekend watch.  As I've said earlier, since I own a couple of earlier Sony analog watches, they'll work nicely for nights out.  I wear mine with the mint green band I purchased separately.  It's a nice soft color and looks great when I'm at the dog park or out running errands.  The watch face isn't as large and obtrusive as I thought it'd be.The watch face is fairly responsive.  There've been a few times that I've had to more than doubletap the screen to get it to turn on and the two finger/pinch to close gesture doesn't work 100% of the time, but more often than not it has a fairly responsive screen.  The colors are nice and bright as well.  Adding apps and widgets are done via the app on your phone, and it was a little cumbersome and confusing at times, but once it's set up, it's pretty sweet.  The messaging apps (text, email, voicemail) only show you the most recent message and not a list.  It does take a second for the smartwatch to alert you to a call coming in, but it's very easy to accept or reject with just a tap.  That function alone has made this purchase worth it since it's so much easier to glance at my wrist when driving instead of looking down at my phone.  The music app is a bit tricky since I don't use the default music player on my phone and that can't be accommodated with this watch.  Battery life is pretty good.  I throw mine on the charger every night out of habit, but it can definitely go longer between charges.  The charger itself is a little tricky.  It's a proprietary charger, which in itself isn't necessarily a deal breaker for me, but it charges by resting under the clip of the watch and the clip doesn't always hold it firmly enough in place.  You have to make sure when you charge it that you rest it correctly under the clip, then lay it down gently in a position where the clip won't be knocked loose, which happens pretty easily.  The vibration could also be a bit stronger.  There were a few times when I went out of range of my phone and the watch vibrated to let me know that and I didn't notice it without looking at the watch face.  When I do go back in range, however, it relinks easily on its own.It's important to note that this smartwatch is basically an extra screen for your connected cellphone.  Its only capable of showing you the time if it's not linked to your phone, and even then it can only display time if you don't turn it off and back on.The apps available in the market aren't very robust; I haven't really downloaded any 3rd party apps for use myself.  I've tried with a few, but after trying them out, it didn't seem worth to keep, so I ended up uninstalling them.  The screen is small, and although capable of showing video and picture, I wouldn't recommend it.  I'm hoping that development continues with this watch even when the other more anticipated smartwatches hit the market.  This device has a lot of promise and potential.  It's stylish and very functional and I hope it doesn't get abandoned by Sony or 3rd party developers.

Scrolling around is hit and miss. The watch sits too high on the wrist due to the clamp on the watch to hook it to the strap. Sony should have redesigned the watch without this elevated clamp. Put normal watch-strap connectors on the sides of the main watch face and thus eliminate the need for the raised bottom clamp. Then, this watch would look and feel much more like a watch and not some weird elevated square sitting on the wrist.

B007VG6ZC8,AD4XKDR0MD7JO,Ron from Michigan,"[1, 1]","The smart watch works great to receive notifications of text messages and other items at times when I have to have the volume off and do not feel the vibration from my phone. There are many add-ons but I'm now in the process of removing a number because battery life has fallen drastically.There are add-ons for email, including gmail and K9mail. I have used both a free gmail program and then added a paid program to also give text of messages. I get too much regular email to want to have smart phone notifications so I have not tried the others.The Facebook add-on did work well, and could be set up to only give notifications of messages to me or posts by certain people. The Twitter add-on did not work as well. While it gave the option of only picking up tweets from certain people, tweets from many others did show up on the phone. Facebook and Twitter were the first two to be dropped as I'm watching to see if battery life improves. There is also one which displays RSS feeds. You can put in your own feeds but it is easier to use Google Reader feeds. It did work to select only a handful of my feeds.Other add-ons include percent charge on the phone and weather. Another add-on can be used to control music players on the phone, controlling volume, pausing and restarting. I tried this with a few different phone apps. The volume worked in each case, but pausing only worked on some of the programs.I didn't like the rubber watch band it ships with, but I found a black leather watch band on an old broken watch which happened to fit. The watch also lacks a second hand which I sometimes need.

In the first two units, the bottom right of the screen won't register touches properly and I had to touch more towards the center to ""touch"" the bottom right.I have had the watch for about 2 weeks now. Using it daily. The watch is pretty much like a secondary screen that can be made to display all or a selected few categories of the Android notifications that you get. Quite handy when you get Facebook, SMS or other messages when you are in a meeting and the phone is in your pocket. There are a few good free and paid 3rd party plugins that make the watch even better. Search around and install them.The watch UI is not super smooth, but it's also not terribly slow. Definitely usable. I can leave the watch connected 24hr/day and it lasts for about 3 full days. Pretty impressed by that. The phone is a Nexus 4, which I think supports Bluetooth 4.0 which is supposedly more power efficient.The only two cons that bother me the most:* To go ""back"" from an ""app"", you have to do a double finger tap or a ""pinch"". There's no other way to go ""back"". So, it's impossible to use when you are holding a coffee in your hand or something similar that prevents you from using two fingers at an angle. Only one 3rd party provides a ""back"" button in the UI. But that's an exception, not the norm. Certainly not for the apps from Sony. I wish it came with a back button on the side. The button on the side that's there in the watch only toggles between ""time"" and ""app screen"" when the screen is on.* The watch is almost useless in daylight. You can squint real hard and make things out. But at that point, I might as well just take out the phone and check it out. But it's still quite handy enough indoors that it's worth keeping.Long story short, at this price ~$95, it's quite a useful/productive device.UPDATE **** 5/11/2013 ****My 3rd unit just died on my one day before the return period expired. So, I returned it and got my 4th unit. The 4th unit came without any calibration issues and worked well, but about a month and a half later, the battery just died abruptly. It won't hold any charge for more than 30 mins even after a day of leaving it charging. Looks like the watch can get to this state if you completely drain the battery (and cause auto shutdown) when everything is working properly. So, if you have one that's still working, I would recommend not letting it go below about 25%.This had a lot of potential, but SONY seems to have ruined any possibility of success by having terrible quality checks for the product.",1.0,1362009600,"02 28, 2013",Sony SmartWatch US version 1 Android Bluetooth USB Retail Box,77.58,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GqIBW5JHL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3029},Sony,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Smart Watches & Accessories']]"

B00BNR5AEA,A1BVN8OVG91D0H,"Amazon Customer ""apartoflife""","[17, 21]","I originally ordered an international Z but due to a bad experience with the network, I returned it. After noticing the LZ would come to the US with LTE, I started to research it and it began to grow on me. In the end glad I went with the LZ.Like the Z it has a monolithic classy front but this version is very compact which is impressive given the huge five inch display. In the hand it feels like a Samsung galaxy 3 which has a much smaller screen so again impressive. The camera is located in the bottom left hand corner. The location neither improves or degrades video angles. If anything it just makes the phone look cooler and unique. The notification light is also one of my favorite things about the phone. It has a sharp led light design at the bottom middle. It is so bright and viewable from all angles I can even see it when my phone's wallet case is closed. Nice touch. The light is not overbearing either which is great. Not sure why the Z didn't get these neat aesthetic features but they are great. The notification light lights up different colors for different notifications and it also turns on when viewing pictures and changes color based on the overall color the picture. Purely aesthetic beauty and I love it.The screen is super sharp but does suffer badly in viewing angles. Which is not a huge deal with me anyway since I don't like people seeing whats on my screen. The only phone I would say has a superior screen head on is the HTC One. Even this Sony fanboy can't deny that. Where this screen does shine however, is VIDEO. WOW it's beautiful five inch screen made for video. Pictures are beautiful to see on this screen too. Definitely a multimedia phone.The back is another story. While the plastic does not look cheap, it's ribbed with soft rubber and feels great in the hand; it does lose the aesthetic factor and starts to look like a typical smartphone. I really wish they would have made the back flat and glass like the Z. Not sure why they went this route but since it's either in my wallet case or protective case, the back never sees the light of day anyway so no big deal for me. I'm glad they decided to include the small aluminum power button on the side like the Z though. It make the phone pop with classiness.As far as the software goes, like my old Xperia S, it's very similar with a light skin added by sony which I love. It's minimalist and classy looking in my opinion, once you get used to it, it's very intuitive. The walkman music player is the best app in the market in my opinion. It looks beautiful and includes equalizer. The notification light also lights up and changes color based on color album art. The video app is neat to adding movie info and uses snippets of the video as a preview when in the main screen too. A + on Sony's multimedia apps. It's also powerful with minimal lag.The Camera is definitely a plus on this phone. Pictures are clear and it includes many more feature options over it's predecessor. This camera can easily replace a point and shoot camera.Of course, this is not a high end smart phone without the LTE. Another huge plus over it's ""big"" brother the Z. While the Z is LTE outside the US, it has been confirmed it will NOT be LTE in the states. To have such a beautiful screen for video, it would be a huge minus with no LTE. After testing it out, it blows away HT+ without a doubt. Average speed is about 30mb compared to 7mb fir HT+.  This of course if your area has LTE service. At first I thought I could live without it, now I can't.The phone does come with a remote control sensor for tv's and its super simple to program but they flubbed this one.... they put it in the side. So if you buy a protective case or in my case, a wallet cover, it covers the sensor! So you have to take the phone out to use it. They could have easily put the sensor near the earphone jack which is at the top of the phone and avoided the problem. Also, it's not intuitive to use as a remote control if you have to hold it sideways. I would think you would want to hold the phone vertical like remote control. Big flub Sony.Finally, Phone quality experience is the best I have ever had on a smart phone. The Z has awful call quality and speaker quality. This is probably due to the fact that it is waterproof and they would probably have extra filters to protect the phone. If I have the option, I would rather have good call quality and speakers. I Mean it is a phone after all. Sony has even included software to tweak the sound quality of phone calls! Impressive feature no one probably knows about. Comparisons with my wifes samsung galaxy 3 and brother's Iphone 5 also confirmed the superior call quality.The only thing that would make this phone perfect for me would be is if it was as thin as the Z, it had the glass back like the Z and the remote sensor at the top of the phone. Otherwise, this phone is superior to the Z and merits a five star rating.In the end, I am super happy with my decision and very happy with this phone. I have to admit, it is very expensive but if you want high end, this is high end.******UPDATE******* PLEASE READ!6/4/12 My ZL DIED. Simply put died. I put it on the charger overnight and and when I woke up late due to my phone alarm not going off, I discovered the charger light was not on and the phone would not turn on. I tried a hard start with volume up power, different charges, hard start with charger, new software update. EVERYTHING.  I then did some research on the net and discovered this is apparently an issue with both the ZL and Z. It appears to be something with the battery when letting the battery near zero charge. The night before I plugged in the phone the charge was nearly at zero. Support forums have mixed results with many people able to turn their phones back on. But I could not.TWO REASONS FOR THE NEW 3 star rating:1-There is apparently a major defect with the Z's capable of bricking the phone. (unacceptable for such an expensive phone)2-I have never had a sony defective phone from sony, I've had three. So I never discovered how truly horrendous sony support is. Rude and impatient. I managed to finally get a return authorization number so that they can repair the phone but not after jumping through many hoops. To ad insult to injury, I have to pay to ship it to their facility and no apologies for the fact that I paid nearly 800 dollars for this phone and my Data pictures and apps all gone. And it's a turn around time of 14 days so nearly a month before I get my phone back. Did they ask how I was calling them? Did they do anything to make this inconvenience better? Damn, if I spend nearly a grand for a phone, I expect to be treated like dealerships treat luxury car owners when they take there car to the repair shop. Luckily I kept my trusty xperia s and currently using that.While I don't want to take away anything from this wonderful phone, I just can't look past this HUGE inconvenience thus the new 3 star rating from  5.",3.0,1369008000,"05 20, 2013",Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (White),489.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41c4psYmdxL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 233421},Sony,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

B00BNR5AEA,AU5V90NU1ON6O,Tor Slettnes,"[40, 43]","With all the attention is on its more flashy sibling, theXperia Z, the ZL is actually more capable in many ways.  In particular, many reviewers tend to compare the Xperia Z with the HTC One, and the latter tends to be favored; however most of the complaints against the Z are actually improved in the ZL.====Size====To start off with, both the Z and the ZL have a 5"" screen.  The resolution is 1920x1080 (aka 1080p) - too ridiculously high to even care.  The ZL is more compact though; it is basically all screen!  It has the highest ratio of screen surface to overall phone size of any smartphone in the market, and is in fact slightly shorter than even the HTC One (with its smaller 4.7"" screen).That said, the HTC one, although slightly longer, FEELS smaller and easier to use with one hand.  It has a more curved surface on the back, and so the side edges appear much slimmer than the ZL.  And it's slightly narrower as well.I did a side by side comparison with my ZL and a HTC One in a nearby AT&T; Store.  Yes the screen is visibly larger on the ZL, but you mostly notice that in terms of the width.  That's because the Xperia (both Z and ZL) have ""soft buttons"" at the bottom of the screen, whereas the HTC one has dedicated capactive buttons below the screen.  So the larger screen is mostly noticable when you use all of it, e.g. watching movies.======Screen======That brings us right into the screen itself.  Much noise has been made about ""poor viewing angles"", noticeably in Xperia Z reviews.  And to be sure, when viewed from the side, you do see a slight dulling of the colors - but hardly anything I would notice unless it was explicitly pointed out.  I also tend to use matte (anti-glare)screen protectors, which seems to slightly improve (!) the viewing angle.Now, my previous phone was aNokia 808 PureView, which despite its smaller screen and much lower resolution, actually had by far the best contrast ratio of any phone on the market (incl. Samsung Galaxys).  So side by side, the black is not quite as black on the ZL, and the white is roughly comparable.  But the ZL screen is perfectly crisp as it is, and outdoor legibility (in sunlight) is great!So even though many reviewers seem to prefer the screen on the HTC One, I would actually go for the ZL one - as it is noticeably bigger and still very crisp!=====Sound=====Another point reviewers tend to bring up when comparing with the HTC One is the quality of the loudspeakers - since the HTC is quite extraordinary in this regard.  As said in the introduction, though, most reviews compare the One against the Xperia Z, which has a noticeably poorly placed and tinny speaker (its design is focused on water resistance/IP57 certification).  The ZL in contrast has a pretty capable speaker thank you very much!  I did a quick test vs. the HTC One in the AT&T; store, and could really only tell the difference in clarity when held very close.  Of course, the HTC One has stereo speakers, so in close proximity you get extra depth as well.I compared also against my Nokia 808, which also has one of the better speakers on the market.  The 808 can go slightly louder without noticeable distortion, but again, I rarely need volume cranked up that much.  (In situations where you want to listen to music or play movies, you usually do so via external equipment anyway...)The Xperia ZL music player has some sound controls (loudness, equalizer...), which can improve the sound even when playing to external equipment.  The HTC has none.Phone/Voice clarity on the ZL is excellent!  Actually in GSMArena's test, it outclasses most other current phones out there, including the HTC One.(Actually, according to their test, the ZL also has better dynamic range for music playback!  At moderate volumes, of course.)======Camera======This is one area where I am very picky.  Realizing that no other phone (now, or ever!?) will replace the Nokia 808 PureView in terms of photo and video recording quality (Even Nokia's own forthcoming ""EOS"" or ""Lumia 1000"" phone won't be able to match it), I definitely had lower expectations for the ZL.And yes, those lower expectations were appropriate.  Sony have pretty much been the driver in the ""megapixel race"" in smartphones; they had the first 12MP phone (known as ""Sony Ericsson Satio"") out some 4-5 years ago now.  But in terms of actual optical resolution, dynamic range, and nearly every other quality metric, all of their recent smartphones have been somewhat disappointing in that regard.It's hard, I know...  Manufacturers have pushed onto consumers an irrational obsession with slimness, which is quite counterproductive as far as the camera optics (Sensor size, lens) is concerned.The Xperia Z and ZL were the first smartphones to include the Sony Exmor RS sensor, where the ""S"" indicates that it uses backlighting to improve low light performance.  And to be sure, indoor photos are slightly sharper/richer than with the predecessor, Xperia TL (which I previously purchased/returned).Also, compared to the HTC One, it definitely has more resolved detail in good lighting conditions.  Again, in my in-store comparison tests, I could make out small details/prints to a much higher degree with the ZL than with the One.Perceived image noise is the biggest culprit.  Part of this is probably due to sub-par image processing with the phone's firmware, which means it could be fixable with a future firmware upgrade.  To illustrate this, if you take pictures in ""burst"" mode, they often look crisper and less noisy than in regular mode!  (The ""burst"" mode does away with much of the processing that otherwise takes place).  For this reason, a workaround may often be to use the ""burst"" mode even for regular still shots.This is one area, though, where despite its lower resolution and lower detail, many will opt for the HTC One.  That phone has gone in the opposite direction in terms of megapixels (4MP), focusing instead on larger photo cells for improved dynamic range/low light performance.  What REALLY sets it apart, though, is its innovative capture mode, ""Zoe"", which once you push the capture button takes not one, but a series of 20-30 pictures in rapid succession - starting as early as 1 second BEFORE you push the button!  That gives you a lot of extra options to work with - you can pick out the best of these pictures, you can remove moving objects (e.g. a person walking by in the background), and in its built-in album/gallery application, you'll see images not as static tiles, but movable ones (Harry Potter style...)The Xperia ZL's answer, albeit more primitive, would again be the ""Burst"" mode.One advantage the ZL has over both the Z and the HTC one is a physical shutter button, complete with half-press-to-focus.  Even if you use a PIN code to lock your phone, you can go straight to the camera (if enabled in settings).As for me, I'll definitely keep my 808 PureView around for travels and other occasions where I want to have a compact phone/camera solution without sacrificing image quality...=======Network=======There are actually several flavors of the Xperia ZL, like the Z.  This phone (C6506) is the only one among them to support AT&T;'s LTE network - and unlike the HTC One, it also supports T-Mobile's 3G/4G networks.  Otherwise, what's the point of buying an unlocked phone, if you were to be tied to a given carrier's network anyway?That said, there are some AT&T; policies you need to be aware of.  Even though this phone supports their LTE band, it does not qualify you for one of their LTE data plans.  So unless you already have an AT&T; branded LTE capable phone, you will need to get the IMEI (serial number) off one and use that one to register for such a plan with AT&T.;  (In my case, I went into a local store, where the sales clerk was nice enough to use the IMEI from his own AT&T; branded Xperia TL to give me such a plan...)AND - this is important - BE SURE to specifically request an LTE plan, not simply a ""4g smartphone data"" plan.  Without an LTE plan, you will be limited to HSPA+ speeds.  Even though they like to call the latter ""4G"", it actually a ""3G"" technology, running on the same frequency and air interface as UMTS and HSPDA.  (I blame T-Mobile mostly, they were the ones who started marketing this technology as ""4G"", mainly because they did not have immediate prospects of getting LTE like the big guys...)Implicit in all this is that yes, with AT&T; you do need a ""smartphone"" data plan with this phone, whether you use 4G or not.  AT&T; have recently started to compare the IMEI (serial number) of connected phones with vendor models, and ANY Android phone will automatically ""qualify"" you for such a plan.  Meaning, to serve you better, they will automatically ""upgrade"" your $10 or $15 ""data unlimited"" plan (if that's what you currently have) to a $30/month ""3GB smartphone data"" plan.  So if you are buying an unlocked phone in order to avoid this tax, better look at something like the Nokia 808 PureView instead.=======Battery=======Android sucks juice through triple straws.  No two ways about that.The ZL has a slightly larger battery than both the Z and the HTC One.  However, since the screen is also larger than the One (and with the same resolution), it does consume the battery slightly faster when in active use.  Since most people interested in this phone are likely to be ""power users"" that play with their phone a lot, this should be of some concern.Sony has added what they call a ""Stamina Mode"", where data connections are turned off for most background applications while the display is sleeping.  You can add exceptions (e.g. the mail reader, WhatsApp/Viber, etc).  And yes, this DOES help the standby life to some degree.With or without Stamina mode, the ZL lasts a bit longer than both the Z and the HTC One when idle.  (Again, how often will it remain idle in playful hands though?)This also brings me to one of many things I don't like about Android.  The GPS is enabled or disabled by you, the user.  While it's enabled, the battery runs out pretty fast.  When it's disabled, navigation (e.g. Google Navigation, WisePilot - also included) don't function well.  I wish they could fix some of these obvious shortcomings (I'll get back to more) from the Symbian playbook.  Maturity counts, you know.==============User Interface==============The world of Android UIs is gradually coalescing around the ""stock"" interface provided by Google.  By now, Sony is in most respects more ""in line"" with the stock experience than Samsung or HTC, and so there should be no big surprises (that's a good thing!)They've added a few bells and whistles here and there, though:* In the task manager, you'll see a few ""mini apps"": A calculator, a notes application, etc.  You can download additional ones, such as an ""IR Remote"" application to control the built in IR blaster and thereby your TV.  These are miniature overlays on the screen, similar to e.g. the ""Dashboard"" in Mac OS X.  Quite handy for quick access to these functions.* The drop-down notification pane includes toggles at the top (WiFi, Bluetooth, Mobile Data, Silent Mode, and a Settings icon).  This being Android, though, you don't get the quick access to specific settings (e.g. Bluetooth connections while a Bluetooth is active, USB modes while a USB cable is connected, etc) the way Symbian does.  Instead, you get a bunch of noise - each time an email arrives, each time an application has updated itself, etc...  Ah well, c'est la vie.* The ""WALKMAN"" music player - it's nice!* Extra homescreen widgets: ""SociaLife"" for a quick summary from FaceBook, Twitter, news sites, etc.; Image gallery where you can quickly flip forth/back among your recent pictures; Toggle bar to quickly turn off/on various things (WiFi, HotSpot, Bluetooth, Flight Mode, GPS, etc..), and a few more.There are also some Sony services, for instance to access the ""Sony Entertainment Network"" (Movie rentals, etc).  Most users will use Netflix instead of course.=======Storage=======The phone has 16GB of storage built-in, but supports SDXC cards (currently the largest one available is 64GB).This was one of the main selling points for me vs. the HTC One, which does NOT take expandable memory.  With the latter, you are stuck with the 32 or 64 GB in the phone itself - whereas for the ZL, you can upgrade once 96 GB or 128 GB cards become available.  And more importantly, if the phone dies (say, water damage), you cannot get your data off the built-in memory (HTC One), but can easily retrieve it from a removable SD card.That said, the Xperia Z and ZL have issues with certain SD cards - notably the SANDisk Ultra class 10 cards.  I had been using such a card for a year on my Nokia 808 without any issues, but in the ZL, I would get frequent ""disconnected"" errors when writing large chunks of data (e.g. music/movie synchronization).  I now placed that same SANDisk card in my wife's SamsungGalaxy Notephone, also without any issues.Ironically, ZL works fine with aSAMSUNG 64GB, as well as earlier generationSANDisk Class 6card.=====================Media synchronization=====================I use a Mac, so one important selling point for me vs. a Samsung Galaxy was the availability of the Sony Media Bridge application, to synchronize media (photos/videos with iPhoto, music with iTunes), browse the filesystem, etc.  HTC also has such software - at least for iTunes synchronization - I find it rather ridiculous that Samsung does not.  Animosity, perhaps?That's the theory.  In practice, I also found that the Sony Media Bridge appellation chokes on large synchronization jobs.  I have been trying for several weeks to synchronize a few playlists (a total of ~3000 songs), and while some of the issues were related to the SANDisk SD card incompatibility, the Media Bridge application also errors out quite frequently.  On top of it, it consumes ~300% cpu (3 full cores), 5GB of physical memory, and makes other appellations on my Mac run very slowly.3rd party applications do exist to do such synchronization, though with Android, this is quite clunky.  It involves either mounting the SD card in ""Mass Storage"" mode (dumb!), or syncing over WiFi (slow, battery draining, EMR inducing...)  I eventually got the job done using ""TuneSync"", available in the Android store.  Still, this is one area where manufacturers (incl Sony) could do a better job.  (The now-defunct Symbian OS does this much better...)============To sum it up============The Xperia ZL is a very nice phone!  The screen is incredibly crisp, if not with quite as vibrant (or gaudy) colors as OLED displays like on phones from Samsung or Nokia.  And with the highest ratio of screen to phone on the planet, this is definitely a phone that appeals if you want a large screen but still pocketable device.I ended up returning mine, mainly because of the disappointing camera -- I said I was picky!  The ""Sony Media Bridge"" fiasco did not help.  I may yet get a HTC One, though I am not too thrilled about Android in many ways (mainly for small details such the way multiple email accounts are handled, difficulty in importing photos to a Mac, etc), and certainly would want to have a way to disable the ""BlinkFeed"" feature in that device.  But in the meantime, I have returned to my Nokia 808, which lets me use a cheaper data plan, and which on balance has fewer annoyances...So the Pros over the HTC one are:- Larger screen (Noticable!), while phone is nearly as compact- Removable memory - better for post-mortem data recovery- Longer battery life when idle/in your pocket- Less annoying UI (no BlinkFeed, toggles in notification pane, better widgets)- Higher resolution camera/more detail.- Camera shutter button.Pros of the HTC One over the ZL:- More classy construction; aluminum body. (But the ZL is no slouch; also you'll probably want a case around it anyway...)- Faster processor (but the ZL's is ridiculously fast too... you won't notice)- Better viewing angles on screen (but again, you won't normally notice)- Better battery life when in active use (e.g. watching movies)- Crisper sound, especially with higher volumes; stereo front-facing speakers- Some nice HTC customizations in the default email reader, incl. more professional quoting style in replies- ZOE!  That's the ONE thing for which I may get it!I should also mention the Samsung Galaxy S4, which many will choose based on marketing and the spec sheet.  For me, that is not an option, for these reasons:- Very cheap plastic construction.  The phone feels cheap.- No FM radio.  I use this while commuting to work by train or bus.  Internet radio is not as versatile, and eats up data.- Poor/no Mac support.- Inferior reception/call quality.",5.0,1367452800,"05 2, 2013",Sony Xperia ZL LTE C6506 Unlocked Android Phone - US Warranty - (White),489.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41c4psYmdxL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 233421},Sony,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

I've gone through many types of headsets.  My last bluetooth set was the LG HBS700.  The LG was fine for a while, but they were damaged from sweat so I tossed them in the trash.  I looked around and found these.  I liked that I can get notifications and control my music.  In practice it's kind of wonky.  You still need a headphones with a cable connection.  At least this device is way lighter than the LG headset.  I stole and idea from the LG headset as I really liked that I could store the ear plugs away with a magnetic holder when not in use, so I epoxied some tiny rare earth magnets to the side of the SBH50 and onto the back of the ear plug (I purchased a separate short single sided headphone for this) and can clip the SBH50 to my collar and the magnet will hold the ear plug and when I need it I just grab it and stick it in my ear, for those times I want to use it around the office and not have a headphone stuck in my ear all day.  The setup works fine, but I end up not using a headset around the office, so it was just more to see if I could make it work.  I pretty much use it only when I work out and in those situations I leave them plugged in all the time so I just use the headphones that came with it.  I recently got a pebble smartwatch so I don't use the SBH50 for notifications or even to control my music anymore - I just use the pebble.  If I would've already had the pebble I think I would've just got the version of this without the screen.  Battery life is better than the LG headset, and it's helpful that it does indicate battery life on screen so I guess having a screen is still useful.  So far I like this better for my needs than just about everything else I've tried.  I can clip this in a place that it won't be dripping with sweat so hopefully it'll last longer, and the battery life is good, sound quality is good enough, I can still answer calls if I need, it's very light and barely noticeable, the clip is sturdy enough (I've heard clips on earlier sony models were prone to breaking), if the headphones go bad from sweat I can just replace them and not have to replace the device.",5.0,1387584000,"12 21, 2013",SBH50 HEADSET BT STEREO BLACK WRLS NFC FM RADIO MICRO USB US WARRANTY,49.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31niPqt43aL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 15813},Sony,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Wired Headsets']]"

This phone is a beast! Out of the past phones this one is all of the positives combined! Has the battery of the Note Series, the premiem materials of the HTC ONE, and the Dev support of the S4. When I first opened this phone I loved how nice it felt in my hand. Now the phone wasn't perfect though! I believe the model I received was for a German T-mobile carrier. It had a bit of bloat, but was neutralized after I flashed factory 4.2.2 firmware. Since then it's been dead reliable and is often a conversation starter! If you're not getting data or LTE, make sure your APN settings are correct under the settings. Okay on with the review, It's battery lasts me all day (5-6hr screen on time @ 15hr+ overall life). If you're not getting near those figures make sure you cycle the battery a few times (Cycle = full charge to 0 percent battery). Then there's the Sony Camera. It performs great and shoots excellent quality photos. It's waterproof and dust proof. The only con of this phone is the tiny sound it produces, but his is the trade off for being water proof.The only other Android snapdragon competitors are G2, Nexus 5, and the Galaxy Note 3.

T-Mobile is one of the slowest companies to upgrade operating systems and currently the Sony Xperia Z1s does not have the right version and of course T-Mobile has no information on when any future OS updates will happen.This phone is BIG, but not so big that it becomes un-usable.  Before the Ultra I would carry around my 7 inch tablet and phone, but now the tablet stays home.This works perfectly on T-Mobile.  Out of the box I put in my old sim and was off and running.

T-Mobile tech took me to a couple of settings screens, entered some server addresses and up and running it was!Pros:As of this review the phone is discounted by about $230 so if you are looking at this phone you might wanna move fast!Great big beautiful screen!!  Colors are great - crisp and vibrant and movies and videos run butter smooth!WATERPROOF!!!!As of this review KitKat 4.4.2!!!Fast!  No, I mean it's really fast!Micro SD support!No bloatware!  Yay!  Just install what you want!I LOVE the camera!  You might hear others say it is bad, but it's not - lower megapixels than my Z1s, but that is size not quality.HIGHLY recommend taking advantage of the side charger connectors instead of opening the flap each time to charge.  Got two of them - one for home and one for work and love them.  I have the dock, but very interested in the magnetic charging cable, too.It's a beautiful phone and feels great in the hands.  Take advantage of the price drop and get one!  You only live once and you deserve to have a nice toy!Cons:People at work had a great time teasing me at the size of the phone!  Some funny stuff!I wish the phone had some of the Z2 features such as 4K video recording.  Hardly a con that it doesn't but Sony is cranking out devices so fast I'm not going to be able to keep up with upgrades.  Will stick with this phone for a while.Overall it's an amazing phone!  I decided not to use a case, but instead I'm just going to put on a Skinomi  full body screen protector.  It's what I used on my Z1s and it worked great!  Since the phone is waterproof it is super easy to install - just spray it till it is soaking wet and apply LOLBest of luck everyone!",5.0,1403136000,"06 19, 2014",Sony Z1 C6903 Unlocked International Vesion LTE 800 / 850 / 900 / 1700 / 1800 / 1900 / 2100 / 2600 -Black No Warranty,409.59,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41jHa67upaL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 6685},Sony,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"
B00FB2XNCE,A1HRXARQBPTHU2,Alejandro,"[87, 111]","Let me first start off by saying that I actually liked this smart watch.  I have the original Smart Watch 1 by Sony as well, and compared to that model, this one is 100% better.  Unlike the previous model, you can actually see the screen in the daylight and the watch works as a watch (i.e., it will tell you the time) even when disconnected from the phone.  For SW2, I bought the metal wrist-band, so it had a nice heavy weight to it like a real watch.  It works great as a notification device, so that you don't have to constantly check your phone, especially in meetings where that would be inappropriate.Having said all that, however, the manufacturing quality on this is HORRIBLE!!  The first SW2 that I got died within 3 weeks.  The screen froze and completely bricked and would not power off or reset no matter what I tried.  I waited a few hours, but no change what-so-ever.  Luckily, I was within my 30 day return period, so I exchanged it for a new one.The second SW2 worked fine for about 5 weeks.  Then one day, when I glanced at my wrist, I noticed that the watch was missing!  I still had the metal wrist-band on my wrist, but the watch itself (i.e., the square unit) had popped out of the frame/case that was attached to the wrist band.  [Check out my photos in the Image Gallery.]It turns out that while my wrist-band is metal, the watch itself is plastic and very light.  That is why I had not noticed that it had popped out during the day, because the wrist-band accounts for 95% of the weight.There are two major manufacturing defects with this: (1) the plastic watch unit is glued onto the metal frame.  GLUED!  It's not screwed on or bolted.  Sony used single lines of glue on each of the 4 sides!!!  [See my photo in the Image Gallery.] (2) Once the glue wears off, the watch pops out outward easily, because the frame that watch rests on does not encase the watch on the face side of the watch, but instead, it encases the watch unit on the bottom side - the side that rests against your wrist.  Of course the watch will pop out if there's nothing but a thin line of glue holding the plastic unit onto the frame!!!I called Sony warranty at least 4 times, but they all refused to help me on account that I lost the main watch unit.  I explained and they even agreed that it is a manufacturing defect that the watch unit popped out of the frame.  But, because I don't have the main unit, they claim they cannot replace it under warranty.  It didn't matter that the only reason I lost the watch unit is because it popped out of the frame due to the manufacturing defect.This is so typical of Sony!!!  They make products that are clearly not manufactured with high quality, and they back up their products with poor customer service.  I highly doubt you would ever see an Apple product or Apple customer service like this.",1.0,1387238400,"12 17, 2013",Sony Smart Watch SW2 for Android Phones,141.37,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BbpnSrRRL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2452},Sony,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Smart Watches & Accessories'], ['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Jewelry: International Shipping Available'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories', 'Computer Components']]"

B00FB2XNCE,A3SS042FJQJN39,Clutch,"[35, 37]","I purchased this watch because I was tired of waiting for another smart watch whose name will not be mentioned. Anyway: This watch is fine so far (I just received it tonight).Setup was a bit of a pain. *Before you set up the watch be sure to download these two applications: 'Smart Connect' and 'Smartwatch 2'.*If you're using NFC pairing then lay your watch flat on its face then slide the back of your phone against the back of the watch until you either hear or feel the watch vibrate. Keep the phone close to the watch and it will load up.Once the setup is complete you're free to go to the Smart Connect application and download applications that come with the phone. Whilst downloading one application, scroll down to see other recommended applications. I'm glad that this watch has been released for some time now because when it first came out, the applications I downloaded (like Spotify) weren't available.Pros:Lightweight.Is comfortable on my wrist.Easy to swipe from screen to screen.Brightness - My brightness is dimmed down quite a lot (less than 25%) and the screen is still clearly visible.Infinite possibilities with application creation.Price - Way cheaper than Samsung Galaxy Gear (almost half the cost).ConsSetup process - See above.Messages - The messages read individually as if on an old flip phone; the messages are not grouped together. Not that big of an issue, but still worth mentioning.Watch faces - Not many watch faces are offered, but I found one that I like nevertheless.""Limited colors"" - I put this in quotes and under cons because while you can change out the wristband, I've read reviews stating that if you do it voids the warranty.If you were deciding between this item (Smartwatch 2) or the Samsung Galaxy Gear then choose this.Will continually update as the time moves on.------------------------------------------------Update 23/2/14: Charge appears to hold for three days. Uses include checking the weather, messages, receiving calls and the occasional Facebook message. However, there is a slight problem; whilst charging/after the watch is done charging, the battery bar that is displayed is never full. Even when I first received the watch and fully charged it.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 24/2/14: Problem about the charge has been remedied. If you're using a Samsung/Galaxy device, then you can simply use your phone charger to charge your watch. This has worked for me and now has my watch at 100% battery. I won't charge it again until the battery runs out to truly confirm the battery life.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: 26/2/14: Charge is holding quite fine after two days of use. Battery is ever so slightly starting to go down, which means it might make it past three days and all it truly needed was a full charge via the phone charger. I've run into a ""problem"" whilst trying to delete applications from the watch. I'll list the steps as best as possible-On your phone click on the application you wish to delete > Hit the home button > Hold the home button > Hold the application until the tiny menu pops up > Click 'App info' > Click 'Uninstall' > Click 'OK'.Go to your Smartwatch > Find the application you just deleted from your phone > Click on it > -Once that is done, the application should remove itself. It's easier than it appears to be; it's just a lot of steps which are quite easy, and are really small steps.The only problem is deleting pre-installed applications. This cannot be done, so be wary of what you install on your Smartwatch from the pre-installed application list when'st you first get it.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------3/1/14Day SIX of NO CHARGE! This watch is amazing! Only problem currently is the lack of the weather application to be able to open. This could possibly (and hopefully) be due to not having a full charge or near a full charge. The battery looks to be at about 25% currently, and I do have a double today at work. The watch might just make it for seven full days with only one full charge (or even longer?). This is incredible. I'm not too sure if the watch will still work as just as a watch (being able to ONLY tell the time) when the battery dies. I suppose I'll find out.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------3/2/14Holy crap! DAY SEVEN!!! This morning, around 11 a.m. before I left for work, the watch vibrated and said '10%'. And guess what? It's still on and hasn't died yet and I have been using it excessively since last night and today. It's holding up just fine. I really want to reiterate: *IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING BETWEEN THE SONY SMARTWATCH 2 or the GALAXY GEAR THEN GET THE SONY SMARTWATCH 2!* -It's still holding it's full charge for seven days (one week) now, even with moderate AND excessive use. This watch is truly better than the Galaxy Gear, and half the cost too! It does exactly what you'd want it to do. Notifies you of a notification, be it Facebook, text, Snapchat, Kik, etc. If you get the Galaxy Gear you have the option to reply back on the watch. Hello...the screen is so much smaller AND it's in T9 (which is where you have to type the number 1 three times if you want to get to the letter 'C'). Also, with all the reviews I read on that, I highly doubt the Galaxy Gear's charge can hold up to this.*This watch's rating is going from a 4 Star to a 5 Star. This has been truly impressive and has held up now since I got it back on the 18th of February. This will be my last edit to this review as there's not much else to say that I haven't already.---I know my review is long, but if you read the whole thing, you'll be glad you did.

As far as bands go, there are multiple options, any 24mm band can be used to personalize.

The watchs screen displays icons much similar to the ones on your phone. There are apps for answering the phone, twitter, facebook and so on. The only achilles heel of this watch is that the default email function ONLY works with Sony phones, which is a big slap in the face.

I also check the weather frequently with it. It's fully waterproof, to a certain depth of course. The battery lasts me about 4 days if i disable bluetooth on the watch when I go to bed. Pairing is simple. I had to purchase a black leather wrist strap because the cheap rubber one included shredded when I got the watch caught on the dish washer edge. Bluetooth 4.0 on the phone end seems to be more battery efficient, and I see no drain whatsoever due to the watch. Going from 99% to 96% after 6 hours of not using the phone and getting loads of notifications on the watch. Bluetooth 3.0 on the other hand drains the phone rapidly.

I can also control the music player and camera through the watch, as well as all my toggles like wifi and gps. Can also see phone battery life through that watch app; commander. It charges extremely fast on my 2.1A charger.

B00FB2XNCE,A2PSC7LUNIDEAH,Dmitry Kristal,"[2, 3]","I was torn between this and Galaxy 2, but not anymore.  Not only is Sony much cheaper and suits me better, but as of April, 2014, you can now change the wallpaper, similar to Galaxy 2 watches.  Overall I think this smartwatch is better suitable for me than Galaxy 2 and here is why:Battery lasts longer:  Two plus days of moderate use and it still keeps on ticking.  Charging it everyday would make it feel like another device rather than a watch.  I wasn't a fan of wearing a watch, but I am now.Charging:  To charge this, simply connect it to any USB-powered outlet or computer.  Galaxy 2 offers a complicated dongle and because I'll have to charge it more often, it would become a hassle.Less is more:  I realize that with Galaxy 2 I can take pictures and use it as a speakerphone, but do I need that?  First off, taking a picture with your watch will make you look downright creepy at times and I'm sure with time, more public places will notice and restrict the use of it(like gym.)  While talking through a watch might be handy at some point, do I really need to look like a Power Ranger on a street?Thinner:  Sony is thinner by design and as I've mentioned before, it was important for me to have a swartwatch that resembles a more traditional discreet watch rather than a &#34;look at me I'm a futuristic device watch.&#34;Cheaper:  If you get the right deal, this watch can cost you almost two times less than Galaxy 2 and because I do not eat caviar for breakfast nor own a diamond-studded swimming pool, this is important to me as well.Please note that I am not putting Galaxy 2 down.  I'm a fan of both brands.  I own a Galaxy phone and a tablet, which is why I was so torn, but Sony2 suited my lifestyle better.

B00FB2XNCE,A2507ZYWGMY9BK,Gcat,"[6, 7]","The typical way to check a notification on your phone is to pull it out of your pocket, hit the power button, swipe to unlock, and swipe to see the notifications. There are many situations where going through this process is rude, dangerous, and/or difficult such as driving a car, riding a bike, doing construction work, sitting in a meeting, carrying a bag of groceries, holding your child's hand, etc. If you get tens to hundreds of notifications throughout the day, having a notification device on your wrist can be a huge benefit.I've been using the Sony Smartwatch2 for a couple months and it generally does the job well. Notifications and phone calls display automatically on the watch face without requiring the push of any buttons. About 10-20 words can be displayed on the watch which is generally enough to tell if you want to deal with it now or later. You can even read an entire email on the watch without a button press by just swiping up.The Smartwatch2 is very limited in terms of customization or settings. While more flexibility would be nice, it is not a huge deal to me because I just want the watch to do its job as a notifier and not try to be a mini-Android device. I purposely keep my watch bare-bones as far as apps so as to not cause any problems. Certain apps like the calendar app are buggy anyway.One of the best features is that it charges via universal micro-USB. If you are considering a smartwatch, you likely already have micro-USB chargers all over the place. The battery life is pretty good. If you turn off your watch at night, it will last a few days between charges.Another nice feature is the non-proprietary watchband which can accept any 24mm generic band. This allows easy customization or replacement of a broken band.There are some negatives with this watch which can be annoying:*The range of this watch could be a lot better. The watch needs to be within about 20 feet from your phone. This is a Bluetooth limitation so it's not really the phone's fault. The lack of range means that if you are walking around your house without the phone in your pocket, you will be going in and out of range all the time. Every time you go in or out of range, the watch vibrates. This gets annoying fast and will cause you to think you are getting notifications when you are not.If you are right around the outer limits of the range, the Smartwatch2 may vibrate constantly as it pairs and un-pairs every few seconds. This happens to me all the time when I'm sitting on my couch watching TV and my phone is in an adjacent room. There is no way to turn off this vibration notification as far as I know. (Note: This issue has been resolved with an update.)I hope future generations of the watch can connect to my home network so I can get notifications anywhere in my house.*There is no way to tell if your Smartwatch2 is actively paired or not. A small LED on the outside of the watch to signal the pairing status would be a great help.I researched other smartwatch options prior to purchase but felt the Sony version suited me the best. The Galaxy Gear and the Pebble use a proprietary charger which is a huge negative. The Galaxy Gear is more expensive, not as universally compatible, and has much less battery life.Overall, the Sony Smartwatch2 works well as a pure notification device. It does its job effortlessly and reliably (as long your phone is in range), and the battery doesn't require frequent recharging. As long as you aren't expecting much more than that, you will be happy.UPDATE: I would strongly recommend the ""Find Phone"" app which allows you to locate your phone even if it is on silent mode.UPDATE April 2014: A new software update allows you to disable the connected/disconnected vibration notification. The watchface is also more customizable.

B00FB2XNCE,A3CSZGXOQMPY3P,"Jonathan Morales ""deitiphobia""","[48, 54]","I tried out the Samsung Galaxy Gear smartwatch but after a few days returned it and decided to try the Sony SmartWatch 2. This review is a bit of a comparison of the two watches. I hands down prefer the SmartWatch 2 over the Galaxy Gear for several reasons.1) The strength of this watch is that it isn't trying to be everything. Because of that, the price is now 1/2 of what the Galaxy Gear cost and that makes this watch a very good value.2) Don't sweat the lack of camera or speaker phone that the galaxy gear has. The camera was gimicky on the Galaxy Gear and unnecessary. The speakerphone while useful at times in the Galaxy gear, is not something I miss at all now that I've switched to the SmartWatch 2.3) I think the Sony SmartWatch 2 looks better than the Gear. It has a subtlely handsome look and an understated quality feel and appearance to it. You can wear this watch with almost anything and it would not clash or draw attention to.4) I got a few compliments from women and men about my watch the first day I wore it to work. No one has any clue it's a smartwatch at first and just think it looks cool. The Galaxy Gear I thought was more eye catching in a way I didn't like or want.5) The display on the SmartWatch 2 is always showing the time. I love it! The GG has the display off until you bring up your wrist up in front of you to look at the time, then it would delay for an awkward second, before the screen turns on and you can see the time. The SmartWatch 2 is easy to tell the time at any time.6) I work in a hospital and must do constant hand washing. The SmartWatch 2 is waterproof, while the Galaxy Gear is not. I was very afraid to splash water on the GG and it drove me nuts as I don't have time while working to have to worry about drying my watch all the time or trying to protect it from splashes.7) The screen on the SmartWatch looks just fine. It's not as sharp as the GG screen, but it doesn't matter. You can easily read many rows of tiny text on the screen when receiving longer messages. Yes you can see pixels up but so what. It's still perfectly decent display for the use case.8. The SmartWatch UI acts just like Android device. There are back, home and menu keys. There is a swipe down gesture that brings down notifications.9. The black rubber watch band is very comfortable in all day use. I couldn't say that about the Galaxy Gear at all. The Galaxy Gear irritated my wrist throughout a days. Part of the metal clasp of the Gear watch band would rub against my wrist and caused me irritation. Also you can replace the SmartWatch band with any watchband.10. My suggestion is to NOT load a lot of useless apps for use on the Watch. I only install the free &#34;WatchIt!&#34; notification app, along with the gmail and text apps. The WatchIt app will allow you to send any notification that appears on the top of your mobile phone to the watch as well. I started off by blacklisting all apps so they DON'T show notifications. Then I go through and approve only the ones I want. Be conservative in what apps you allow to buzz you on your watch. It will get annoying quickly if you allow dumb stuff to bother you and buzz your wrist all day.11. You'll want the stock text message app as it allows you to view and reply to text messages using preformatted replies. You can create your own pre-formatted replies. I deleted all of the stock pre-formatted replies and created my own. When you get a text alert on the watch, you press the menu button, and then the text message icon button to reply. Then you can swype left or right to cycle between your preset replies. It works pretty well and doesn't try and shove more functionality that just won't work on a smartphone.12. The watch does what it's supposed to do. I can view the time at all times, and it lets me get notifications to my wrist so I don't have to pull out my phone at work (which we have a strict no cell phone policy at work). I don't miss any important calls or text or emails anymore. I know when I have to step outside and deal with a call or text and when it can just wait.",4.0,1386028800,"12 3, 2013",Sony Smart Watch SW2 for Android Phones,141.37,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BbpnSrRRL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2452},Sony,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Smart Watches & Accessories'], ['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Jewelry: International Shipping Available'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories', 'Computer Components']]"
B00FB2XNCE,AZOK5STV85FBJ,"Kaelan ""frontier_ranger""","[0, 0]","I used this watch for about 4 months now to give it a real world evaluation.-Pros- light and unobtrusive- battery lasts for a few days- customizable- easy to charge with a micro usb-Cons- People will keep asking why you didnt get a galaxy gear- not the best in direct sunlightI bought this item for a few simple reasons. I needed a way to see if I was missing a call or message while on motorcycle/ loud car such as a convertible. It works very well for that. Feel the vibration, look down and see the type of alert. If I have my phone in my pocket, i set it to silent, and then am able to reject calls if I am in a meeting without even taking my phone from my pocket.Sony has released two updates since I have owned this watch. First update allowed me to create my own watch face layouts as well as other tweaks. Second update within the last week now allows me to set my own image as the background.I started out getting all alerts sent to my watch, but I am now down to only Gmail, text messages, and phone calls. You can respond to texts, but only from pre-set responses and you can pre-create your own. Helpful for the motorcycle when i can just tap &#34;on my way&#34; or &#34;sorry, i am currently riding my motorcycle and will call you later&#34;.It does not have a built in camera, but does allow remote viewing of your phone camera. Resolution isnt too high, but it does allow for remotely taken group pics with you in them. I use it at work to see network port numbers in really hard to see areas.I compared it to my cousins galaxy gear watch, and his clearly wins, I could buy over two of these for what he paid vs what I paid. He was shocked that mine could just charge off of the same charger the phone uses, his needs a special device.  If you are looking for a do it all gadget to shove in peoples faces, get the galaxy gear, if you want a sensible watch that happens to have apps, alerts you to notifications, and still has people coming up to you asking &#34;Omg, is that one of those smart watches?!&#34; for half the price of the other one, get the Sony.",5.0,1405468800,"07 16, 2014",Sony Smart Watch SW2 for Android Phones,141.37,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BbpnSrRRL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2452},Sony,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Smart Watches & Accessories'], ['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Jewelry: International Shipping Available'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories', 'Computer Components']]"
B00FB2XNCE,A2ZGDRH48UBXFN,King James,"[5, 8]","Initially, I was was set on buying the Galaxy Gear smart watch and so I went to my local Best Buy to get one.  Fortunately, for me they did not have any in stock and said that if I wanted one I would need to wait a week or so to get one.  Nonetheless, there was a few display watches that I could play with.  I tried the Galaxy Gear on and immediately noticed the how bulky it was on my wrist.  Moreover, it wasn't as stylish in person as I had thought it to be, and it looked awkward to the point that I knew that every time someone looked at my wrist, I would have to explain what the hell the thing on my wrist was.  I don't have time like that in my day.  So the next day I saw that Sony would be releasing its new smartwatch, the Sony Smartwatch 2.  It was 100 dollars cheaper and it looked much more like a watch rather than a device on my wrist.  I also found out that it was water resistant where I could wear it in the shower and could wear it while washing dishes.  The main selling point for me on this watch was the amount of time that a charge could be held without having to recharge the watch (around 2-3 days).  Moreover, this was a third generation product, meaning that there were 2 other previous older versions of the watch that Sony could improve on, which meant they had developed more apps for the watch plus the watch would work with any Android phone running 4.0 or better so if I wanted to change phones I could do that without having to think about my watch being obsolete.  All these benefits were things that the Samsung Galaxy Gear could not provide me.  With that being said, I went into a Sony store and bought a black one with a metal band that costs 20 dollars extra. Overall, I would say that I am somewhat satisfied with the product.  Satisfied in the sense that it is a watch and its stylish, something that a watch should be.  Also, as advertised the phone holds excellent time between charges and the notifications come in pretty much on cue. And, its useful when driving when you can't check your phone, because one can also make calls from the watch, very useful when the phone is connected to the car via bluetooth.  What I don't like about the watch is that it lacks a music app so that I can run Pandora or Spotify through it, apps which I use frequently use.  Instead it gives you a generic Google music app which is very laggy and is very limited.  Additionally, occasionally the watch freezes up and when its functional the watch frequently doesn't respond to swipes making you swipe numerous times for the watch to function.  Further, the bluetooth range is limited to about 25-30 feet max.  So if you live in a bigger home then expect your watch to drop in and out of connection frequently.  It also can't answer calls on your phone from the watch unless you have a bluetooth head set or a Sony smartphone, which kind of annoyed me.  Overall, as a watch the Smartwatch is still expensive, but when compared to the Galaxy Gear, is a more practical and functional device.  I didn't need a video camera/camera on my watch unless I: 1. needed to cheat on a test 2. do something perverted with it.  Additionally I didn't want to look stupid answering my phone from my wrist and talking to my wrist.  So I believe I made the right choice between the two.  But, unless you really want a smart watch I would advise you to wait for Apple or Google to take a shot at it so you can make a better decision, because the smart watch market is limited as of now.",3.0,1383264000,"11 1, 2013",Sony Smart Watch SW2 for Android Phones,141.37,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BbpnSrRRL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2452},Sony,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Smart Watches & Accessories'], ['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Jewelry: International Shipping Available'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories', 'Computer Components']]"

You can download an app that lets you customize your watch faces. I can change it to match my outfit i.e. snake, zebra, leopard, all kinds of colored backgrounds. You can also swap out the wristband and get rid rid of the stock silicon one. I hope more apps are made for it like a stand alone pedometer app to name one. Not being to talk on the watch was not an issue for me as I don't wish to walk around holding my arm up (especially for lengthy conversations, plus that's too much work); I have a headset. You can place calls and reject calls with stock text messages. My phone is buried in a case, in my purse, in my tote bag...whole lotta work just to get to my missed text. If you use the Sony watch faces, the battery charge is great. Because I use the third-party app to see my matching watch face, the battery needs to charge everyday.

B00FB2XNCE,A1GK0VRWY7I3D1,Matthew Dyer,"[1, 1]","The reason I chose 5 stars for the sony smart watch 2 is because it is a superior watch over it's older brother the smart watch 1.  Yes, I did indeed buy both the smart watch 1 and I own and use now the smart watch 2.  Why do I like the smw2?Design:  The design for it is really nice, the screen is nice and clean and the wrist straps can be changed out to any strap that is aviable for its size. I believe the wrist strap has to be either 22 or 24.  I personally use the one that came with it, but plan on buying a Black/gold strap later.  The 3 buttons are ok, they bring me back to an old galaxy phone, but still it's nice to have. The watch itself is light and the battery charger is covered. My only problem with the power button, and this is only a problem because I do what I do is, I stretch everyday before I start work and bringing my left hand back (my watch hand) I accidentally turn off my watch.  It's a mall issue because the watch powers on in like 3seconds.Battery:  This time around versus the smw1 the smw2 is 200% better.  I go days between charging, at least 5-6 days with light use and 3-4 days with moderate.Apps: This is where the smw2 shines.  Through my apps on the smw2 I am able to text friends back through my watch, check my battery life, find my phone, take pictures from my watch but using my phones camera, view emails/texts, photo galleries, take notes, calendar, calculator, weather, music, alarm, flashlight, running app, gps, oh and tell time!.note: If you plan on texting from your watch, keep in mind that you can only send messages that you set up in your phone. The good news is that you can set up a lot. I myself have set up a text for each instance that I would use normally.yes, no, love you, ill get back to you, etc.Display: ok, here is where most have problems. Are the images on your watch HD, heck no! no where near them.  Are they viewable yes.  Are you going to impress people? heck yes!.  I check my time constantly and people go crazy as to what is up with my &#34;back to the future&#34; time piece. The display is good for what it is.  Its color screen which was the selling point for me to buy over the pebble which was approximately the same price, give or take.Conclusion: If you are thinking of buying this or the smw1 buy this trust me you will not be disappointed",5.0,1393459200,"02 27, 2014",Sony Smart Watch SW2 for Android Phones,141.37,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BbpnSrRRL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2452},Sony,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Smart Watches & Accessories'], ['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Jewelry: International Shipping Available'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories', 'Computer Components']]"

B00FB2XNCE,A2FG061KDA1ARB,Mike from Jersey,"[2, 4]","This review attempts to discuss attributes of the Smartwatch 2 not shown on Youtube or Geek sites for prospective buyers considerations and research purposes.I guess the best feature of the Smartwatch 2 is its ability to Auto pair the device with your handset via the NFC tap. You must be running Android 4.2 or greater on your phone!You must download the Sony app called Smart Connect to download apps that are specific to the watch. The caveat here is that you need to have purchased and paired the two in order to see 'what it can do'. There is no clear way to evaluate the capabilities prior to purchase.This can also be said for the Samsung Gear device as well. I look at this the same as I would the 15 minute app evaluation offered by the Play Store except on a higher dollar level. Neither offer the consumer a comfortable evaluation level.One can only hope there will be better OEM firmware updates and better 'useful' third party apps on the horizon. Case in point and obviously one of the major detraction's to the Smartwatch 2 is the limited selection of clock faces!Granted there is a third party app called Custom Watch that adds 14 new watch face templates that are customizable but this app suffers in that it closes when the watch display goes into sleep, as it will revert back to the Sony clock face in embedded in firmware.I should point out that there is an option to do what the developer calls Use as Watch, which keeps the Custom Face focused at the risk of a faster battery depletion.Another minor annoyance is the leading Zero digit always displayed. Example: 8:12PM will read 08:12 even though the PM is displayed. You can also select 24 hour clock as a work around to this if you prefer a military time style display.Also I should mention that the charging port cover does not offer much purchase for the fingernail to open, it is a plastic not rubber type door. With that said the watch body and wake button are very well made. The black silicone strap so far seems impervious to collecting lint that some straps are prone to do.The alert vibrate is perfect on this watch quiet but noticable with a non adjustable 10 second display timeout. The OS is reasonably fast and fluid on it. The Sony branded GMail and SMS extensions (as they are called) will prove useful to most buyers and there are several extensions from Sony that others will find important like the included fitness app, twitter, remote camera, find phone, calendar, facebook, etc.There are many free game and game like apps on the Play Store that are interesting but not very productive for just killing 'Time' ;)Compared to Smartwatch 1 with the LiveWare bluetooth connectivity this watch is superior in its ability to discretely stay in the loop with email and sms. But not so much to customize it as amoled watch. But compared to Samsung's Gear with the whopping 1.9Mpix wart on the band this watch has more appeal to it and hopefully the Gear 2 will be absent of the camera feature for a sleeker wear.All in all it's a nice product and after fiddling with it for a few days i'll be keeping it, but as an honest review with this firmware revision it's just not ready for prime Time unless one insists on up to the second notifications of incoming communications.EDIT UPDATE:- As of yesterday 1/7/2014; there was an update to the Custom Watch app which lets you set AND KEEP ALIVE any of the Custom Watch faces even after the 10 second time out before the watch falls into sleep mode or what Sony calls Low Power. What this means to the wearer is that you do not have to re-select a custom face any time you pick up the watch or back out of a SMS/email read.It also looks like he did some power refinements as well. After installing the update yesterday and then a full charge now it's 24 hours later the battery reads 90% full charge.

B00FB2XNCE,AD4XKDR0MD7JO,Ron from Michigan,"[7, 8]","The second version improves upon some of the limitations of the first, but not all.My phone has replaced by beeper with urgent messages sent over both text and gmail. My primary need for the watch is to be able to see text and gmail messages in cases where either I might not notice my phone ringing/vibrating or when it is awkward to turn on the phone (such as in a movie theater). From that perspective, two of the biggest problems of the first version have been improved upon--the screen is much brighter so that it can be seen outside (plus is adjustable for when I want it dim in a movie theater) and the vibration is much stronger, making it unlikely I will fail to notice the vibration as with the first version. I have noticed some people complain that the vibration is  too strong so it might be beneficial if this was adjustable. I also wish I could customize the vibrations--such as have different patterns under some circumstances. I believe that there is a third party app which might do this.There are also other improvements. The screen is bigger and works quite well to read longer messages. I also use it for RSS feeds and some Facebook updates and can read a fair amount (considering it is still a watch) on it. While I haven't tested it, being more waterproof could be a plus.I prefer the controls of the newer version with menu buttons rather than the old means of tapping. It is a huge plus that, should the phone get disconnected, this still works as a watch.Getting disconnected remains a problem as with the first model. I'm finding that it actually says it has disconnected over bluetooth less often than with the first version, but this still happens. There have been several occasions in which the watch and phone say they are connected over bluetooth but it is not really transferring information and apps which need the phone stop working. I am hoping that software or firmware upgrades improve upon this communication.A minor complaint is that you can't set the order of each app as on the old version. You have a choice of alphabetical or most used. It could also use more options for clock face, at least  a digital version with time and date.Many of the software limitations continue from the first version. For example, the Facebook app is too limited in choosing what information is sent. There should be a on/off control for the entire News Feed. It also takes a long time to set up which people are included if you have a lot of Facebook friends. Newly added people are set to transfer--I would prefer the opposite unless I specifically choose to have them sent to the phone. It would also make things much easier if you can select from lists of people set up on Facebook. There's similar issues with Twitter.The high frequency of times when it is not working reliably remains the biggest problem. Sometimes turning the watch off and on and/or rebooting the phone gets them connected again. Quite often it has been necessary to repair them over bluetooth and reload everything on the watch (occurring more than once a day so far).Update: After using the smartwatch several more days,I'm upgrading it from 3 to 4 stars. I'm still having problems with it losing connections intermittently, but much less often. When they wouldn't connect at all I found that they would often reconnect if I turned off the watch, rebooted the phone, and then turned the watch on again. This is a nuisance, but not as bad as re-pairing and reinstalling everything to the watch. The last time this happened, instead of rebooting the phone, I turned bluetooth off and then on again. It worked that time and I will have to see if this works consistently.Crashes sometimes occur with adding or removing apps, so once the watch is set up as desired there is a lower risk of problems.I also found that less is more. It does seem that having more apps on the watch corresponded with more cases of the watch not responding. It is better to have fewer apps which work well as opposed to more apps and more times when it is not working right. I'm still playing around to determine to what degree it is number of apps, or whether certain apps are more likely to increase problems. Some apps are more meaningful than others. For example, it is a real convenience to have the phone give an alert when there is an alarm set for an event on the calendar. It is less important to run an app on the watch which shows the entire calendar when it isn't a big deal to pull out the phone. I also got rid of the Facebook and Twitter apps for now. For those who do want every bell and whistle installed, I also wonder if newer phones would handle the load better. (I'm using a Galaxy Nexus which is now approaching two years old).The phone is still not as reliable as it should be but has enabled me to monitor incoming messages while my phone was being recharged in a different room.Update 2: The watch has been more reliable after using it longer. I suspect that is a combination of choosing the apps which work best with it and perhaps the Android system now prioritizes the Smartwatch programs after having used them more.  I have removed ""not ready for prime time"" from the original title of the post after previously increasing from three to four stars. It still loses connection from time to time, but less often. If going somewhere where it is especially important that the smartwatch provide notifications without turning on the phone, such as a movie theater, I would reboot the phone first. I also find that BlueTooth does not work as well for streaming audio as well when the Smartwatch is on. I also wonder if this has something to do with how the Android operating system is prioritizing resources.I've found the watch to also be of greater value now with programs which send notifications for multiple programs. This both reduces the number of programs you need running and provides notifications for every program you want shown on the watch regardless of whether there is a smartwatch app. For example, if your phone has notifications for Facebook and Twitter you can have these relayed to the smartwatch without having to run separate programs to monitor Facebook and Twitter. I like WatchIt! the best of programs of this type which I have tried, and it is free. Augmented Smartwatch Pro is an interesting paid app. I don't like it for replacing most notification apps as it is intended, but it does so much that even though I don't use it for notifications it still replaces several other apps such as missed call notification, battery meter, weather (but only gives weather for the current day), rain alerts, phone signal strength, and control of music apps (for pausing and starting, but without volume control).",4.0,1383436800,"11 3, 2013",Sony Smart Watch SW2 for Android Phones,141.37,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BbpnSrRRL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2452},Sony,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Smart Watches & Accessories'], ['Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry', 'Jewelry: International Shipping Available'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories', 'Computer Components']]"

While it doesn't look too big on my wrist..  its dimensions are such (just wide and thick enough) that it doesn't slip under my sleeve cuff, even with the looser button in use.  So it causes my shirt to be hiked up and it sticks out.  If I tuck it under, it is tight... and won't slip out with out my other hand helping.. to see the time!!  This is a deep six for this watch.  If it won't slip easily in and out from under my sleeve cuff, it is just a nuisance.  I hear the Galaxy Gear is bigger but slightly narrower.  I am guessing that this is the reason.  It is the width more than the thickness that is the problem.I am bummed because I like the watch otherwise!Update 10/28/2013I still like this but there are more annoying features1.  Options are unnecessarily limited.  In particular, it would be great to modify the vibrate with regard to number of vibrations and duration. Augmented Smartwatch pro lets you do this but it is expensive and not so easy.  I would love to modify how long an alert stays on the screen.. and modify font size so I could see them!  I would also like to modify the order of the apps on the phone.  You can change them but it isn't very flexible...and there are no directions for doing it.2.  Unless you get to your alert quickly (and you can't modify how long the alert stays on), you have to push the button on the side, Then the home button, THEN the app button. THREE PUSHES??  This makes absolutely no sense.  You should be able to hit one thing, be it the screen or the side button and the last alert should be on the screen.  Again, this could be an option.I am hoping so badly that third party people come up with things that fix these obvious deficiencies.  The apps are limited though.Update 11/4/13Incredibly, the bluetooth connection between the phone and the watch interferes with the bluetooth connection between the car and the phone.  When I receive a call in the car, the voice of the caller is garbled.  The phone is transmitting to the watch because the caller id is on the watch screen.  Turning off the watch doesn't help (because the phone is still transmitting to it).  This is a major issue for me.  I am hoping there will be a solution.

But as a gadget girl, I persisted in finding a reason to need the technology even if it wasn't the galaxy gear. I googled high and low, read CNET and Amazon reviews ad nauseum, watched You Tube videos and narrowed it down to the Sony smart watch 2. What turned me on to try out the smart watch was the greater app availability, greater water resistance, and compatibility with multiple devices. But after trying it out for a week, I realized I didn't really use all the apps I added (about 12), I rarely would have it in a major water-risk situation, and I've had a galaxy phone for several iterations now. So once all those key metrics were blown away, all I was really left with was an unattractive digital watch. I found myself wishing I could quickly snap pictures without pulling out my phone and take quick calls. Soon the galaxy gear was calling my name again. So I returned the smart watch and got the gear. Wow what a difference. (Read my upcoming review of the Gear).So in conclusion, it's not terrible, but it just didn't wow me. The interface was a little awkward to maneuver and it just didn't handle the basics well. Yes it is cheaper than the gear, but if you're the type of person who gets geeked over technology, the extra bucks to get more will in the long run make you a happier technology-lover aka nerd. IMHO.

I previously had a great speaker, but it had a pretty big footprint so this was perfect. In fact, I always wanted to use the old speaker more, but because it was so big I had it hidden in the cabinet below my TV. The Sony SRSX5 now allows me to keep it on the countertop and enjoy big sound anytime I want.The sound from this flat looking speaker is great and fills up my living room. I listen to a lot of Rap and love the bass pumping and this little guy delivers. As I've mentioned before, my all time favorite portable BT speaker is the JBL Flip, but I gotta tell you, this knocks it out of the water (as expected with something that's twice the price I suppose).Unboxing this baby was like opening a fresh box of Crayons. I suppose because I have always had a fondness for Sony and their Walkmans (I once visited Japan and a friend's mother bought me the most amazing and beautiful Walkman ever - this was back in '92!) and have realized that in past years Sony hasn't had the products it used to, or at least not here in the States. The case of the unit is plastic but sturdy; the unit has a good weight to it and won't tip over easily. The charger is a bit on the big side -- I still don't get how, with all our technology today, we still have products with big a** bricks for chargers? Anyone want to partner with me and design small chargers? lol.Pairing the unit to my iPhone was super easy. What's really cool is that it has a USB charger for your device which is nice and which means I can keep my phone right next to the speaker where it belongs when I'm listening to music and not have to worry about losing power. I personally like a USB port better than having a dedicated built in dock because you never know if Apple will change its connector again or even if a friend with an Android comes over they can play their music and charge their phone as well. From a business side, it also makes sense as this unit appeals to both iPhone and Android users.All in all, this unit is amazing. The sound is clear. Bass is strong and trebles are clear even when I turn it up (thought at really high volumes and big bass you do notice some cracking).

B00I053ICY,AOI2MD752ZWFU,"Joseph M. Baltrus, Ph.D. ""Balthazar""","[6, 8]","I fell in love with the this speaker at first glance and listening.  But after some serious testing this is what I conclude:Advantages:+ Musically ...Sound  is loud and clear.  The real test of loudness was it allows you to go way past the max volume of your device by simply tapping the Volume + button.  Distortion is minimal too.  Net result really loud (indoors).+ Design is contemporary and tastefully executed.  But it does look it is meant for indoor use, no ruggedness to it at all. It says sleek and stylish.+ Build quality and driver appear top notch, in other words there are some heavy magnets on these 5 speakers inside.  Almost as heavy as my Bose SL3.+ USB device charging, this is great, until our homes are equipped with USB jacks in the walls, having this capability on your speaker makes a lot of sense.+ Phone call function worked perfectly even with Skype.  I admit I like the speaker phone function on bluetooth speakers.+/- Bass.  I am on the fence with the bass and bass-specific woofer inside.  There are 3 front facing speakers and 2 in the rear but there is no radiated bass coming out of this speaker (rear or front really).  You can feel the bass when holding the speaker but not that much even when touching in front of the surface it is placed on.  This is a huge difference compared to radiated bass woofers (like the Bose SL3 and Mini) that throw a lot of bass out you can literally feel several feet away. As such I found this speaker to be more treble oriented with the bass more or less flat, like you can hear that ""pat pat"" sound on bass-laden music.  Not a negative if your musical choices do not warrant the bass response.Disadvantages:- The ""Sound"" button. This was a real sore spot for me because the TWO manuals included mention nothing about this overtly clear button on the top of the speaker.  Its only when you refer to the online help guide: [...] that you have to dig to find out what the button's purpose is.  Yes you can press it, and you hear a difference in sound but its purpose is not what it seems.  According to the guide, it is for a Surround effect - which appears this is only when the 2 rear speakers turn on.  It is far from surround.  Actually to my ears it is a Treble enhancer.  I am fine with that as for some lesser-quality mp3s I have, it did wonders to the sound clarity. But again that is not the Button's intent.  In fact its purpose is contradicted in the online guide, Sony states: with the button Off, ""You can enjoy Clear Audio+ mode (Sony-recommended sound quality)."" So the obvious question is why have it if Sony is recommending Not to use it.- Touch buttons are way too sensitive.  You cannot lift and carry the speaker by grasping the top as the slightest touch either lowers the volume or unpairs the bluetooth connection (which happened the very first time I picked it up). I tend to prefer hard, press-able buttons.  Just because your phone has a touch screen doesn't mean everything else should.- Get the case if you get this, I wouldn't trust this shiny, slick, boxey design outside without protection.- Power charging plug is a bit on the large side and of course proprietary to this unit.All in all for the price, you are getting a very high quality speaker with some great features and of course musical sound. I am estimating the next two levels on this speaker series are not worth it though, especially the 700 dollar SRS-X9.  I would love to give this SRS X5 - 5 stars but knowing there are other speakers out there for the same or less money that do not have these quirks, I would do a little bit of market research then decide but know full well you won't be disappointed with your purchase decision.",4.0,1398384000,"04 25, 2014",Sony SRSX5 Portable NFC Bluetooth Wireless Speaker System (Black),168.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41W9eszaOBL._SX300_.jpg,,Sony,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Bluetooth Speakers']]"

I have to borrow a friend's Samsung cell to check out the NFC one touch capabilities which is something I personally just don't care about. But, it does work. The hands free calling is as good as any and that IS something I like as a feature. It's nice to crank up the tunes and be able to take an incoming call (of course if you don't WANT that don't pair with your phone, duh).I also have aSony SRSBTX500which has twice the wattage (40 watts vs. 20 watts) but for the life of me I couldn't notice a difference in the audio quality between the two speakers. That isn't a surprise since they're both Sony products. The 20 watt output of this speaker is honestly just a number to me, but it fills up my main room with no problems and without having to put on maximum volume. The fidelity is great with incredibly clear treble and bass - the separation of the two leads to overall top notch clarity. I tested this with the Beatles LOVE album and it handles the array of soft, hard, orchestral, and mixed arrangements seamlessly. I can hear individual instruments perfectly, rather than the mush some portable speakers I also own. I don't know how Sony does the stereo separation in such a small unit, but it's pretty cool.Finally, I charged this speaker fully, turned up the sound about half way, and did get over 7 hours of play time (I had to go to bed). Though light and portable, this makes a nice party speaker for even a midsized apartment.Sony's a good brand for a reason.

You push down on the on/off button on top of the unit and you have connectivity every single time.  It came already charged up but I let it run down so that I could see how long a fresh charge would last.  It lasted almost 1 week of constant usage.The only thing that it does not do is charge up your device.  You will still need to use your USB or a/c adaptor for that purpose.I own the Klipsch GiG as well as a JBL Charge and this speaker blows them both away.

B00I053ICY,A1UNJ46NSB352E,"Moonlight Graham ""Ben""","[0, 1]","The Sony SRSX5 is Sony's lower-end entry into the bluetooth speaker arena (compared to the SRSX7), and it does its job very well. The sound is crisp and clear, and as booming as I've heard in a bluetooth speaker. I've compared it to the SRSX7, and the differences in my ears aren't noticeable. Both give an excellent sound, and this one takes up less space.Setup is a breeze and you can be up and running in no time. It is meant to stand vertically, however. This threw me off for a second, since I was in such a hurry to give this a spin. It's not a big deal, but it does seem like it may be more prone to being knocked over if you are using it in a high traffic area. It seems like it should withstand some abuse, though, as this is pretty sturdy.I spent a lot of time switching back and forth between the Sony SRSX5 and the Bose Soundlink Mini. Both are very similar in sound. In fact, I think the Sony has Bose beat in terms of sound quality, and Bose has slightly more bass.The design is quite nice. The speaker does attract some fingerprints, however. The buttons are well-marked, and using this device is intuitive. The battery life seems quite good. I haven't tested it, but I was using it on and off for a number of days before needing a charge.Overall, this speaker is worth looking at if you are in the market for a bluetooth speaker. As of writing this review, it is about 15% cheaper than the Bose, which is quite a deal.",5.0,1400025600,"05 14, 2014",Sony SRSX5 Portable NFC Bluetooth Wireless Speaker System (Black),168.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41W9eszaOBL._SX300_.jpg,,Sony,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Bluetooth Speakers']]"

But then I tried out the Sony SRSX5. I was like &#34;Whoa&#34;, this clearly sounds better than all of them.

I have owned a number of Sony products over the years and have generally been very pleased with both the value and quality.Sony continues that reputation with the SRSX5 Portable NFC Bluetooth Wireless speaker. I have a number of very good Bluetooth speakers, and count the Jabra Solemate Max, the TDK-A33 and the Ultimate Ears Boom as my favorites. The Sony SRSX5, however, outdoes them all in the sound department.The speaker is small, measuring 8.8 inches x 4.8 inches x 2.0 inches, but it produces a &#8220;wall of sound.&#8221;  The SRSX5 puts out 20 watts, and it has a built-in subwoofer and dual passive radiators. The resulting sound is outstanding, very full sounding, with deep lows and clear, crisp highs. I tested the speaker with all types of music, and was constantly amazed and how good this speaker sounds. Bass is strong (the speaker vibrates). I usually rip my music at 320 kbps or FLAC, and multi-layered music, with multiple horns, strong bass lines and rhythm section, sound great on the Sony SRSX5.The speaker has a setting at the top for ClearAudio+. With this setting selected, highs sound very crisp and clean, and bass is still very strong but probably not as strong as it is with this setting off. Either way, the music sounds great, and, even when turned very high, there is no distortion.Pairing is very simple, and you can connect with the speaker via NFC if you have an Android device. The buttons, except for the On/Off button, are all touch sensitive. Battery is rated at 8 hours, and the speaker has USB input in the back for charging.Bottom line, if you are looking for one of the best sounding speakers on the market today, then I would very highly recommend the Sony SRSX5. The speaker is relatively small and built to last, looks classy, and produces phenomenal sound.  The only negative, and this is small, is that Sony does not provide a carrying case with the speaker, and there is no handle. But its small size makes it very easy to tote around, and the sound it produces is top of line.",5.0,1398556800,"04 27, 2014",Sony SRSX5 Portable NFC Bluetooth Wireless Speaker System (Black),168.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41W9eszaOBL._SX300_.jpg,,Sony,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Bluetooth Speakers']]"

The Bose mini is pretty amazing, say what you will about Bose, this speaker delivers.The Sony handled it like a champ and showed the Bose a thing or two. This speaker has some of the biggest bass I've heard from a wireless speaker system. At 20 watts, this speaker is one of the most powerful on the market.The capacitive touch buttons are touchy but sometimes they aren't very responsive. I think this unit would have benefited from real buttons. There is a setting to loose some of the bass, I could not find any information about this button in the manual, but it does add a bit to the highs and mids.The only real downside is that the battery life is a bit meek compared to the competition. I got about 7 hours per charge. Still, that's enough for most of a work day, or a pretty long party.Overall, this is one of the best portable bluetooth speakers around.

B00I8AYU2I,A1Z2VBLX2VHCIF,Jason Wang,"[6, 6]","After a week of use:I still really like this phone and stand by my 5 star rating, here's some things I've noticed after a week of use:The Screen- It's 720p but honestly it's a non issue, using larger 1080p screens for the past 2 yrs I don't notice a difference I would think Sony will stay with 720p for the Z2 compact and up it to a 4.5in screen.Battery life: If you have 4.3 out the box I wouldnt recommend updating it to KitKat the battery life just isnt as good it will still last you a day to a day in a half on normal use you should be able to get 2 days with normal use, it really depends on how much you value battery life.Screen Size: This is probably the part I'm most torn about, while I love the size when I turn on the phone I can't help to think the screen is just a tad bit small, I wish the side bezels were thinner something that will most likely be addressed on the Z2c. The issue is the on screen buttons take a good amount of screen space while not an issue on the home screen since they are transparent when you open apps they become black and take up valuable screen space making it smaller. May not be an issue to some but just wanted to point it out, if you're coming from a iphone or something similar it shouldnt be an issue but coming form a G2 with a 5.2in screen there are times where I felt the screen was a bit small.Phone Speaker: It's okay, it sounds a bit muffled to me I wish it was more clear volume is okay but overall it's pretty average.Headphone SQ: Very good not quite as good as the Z2 but you shouldn't have any complaints.Software: While Sonys skin is nice there is a lot of bloat for an unlocked phone, it annoys me that there's so much Sony / Xperia junk on here that you cant take off. I have a sony bluetooth headset and it forces me to download the app in order for me to use it, it also appears in the notification tray even after you disconnect it and turn it off the only way to remove it is to go to app info and click force stop. May not be an issue again but just wanted to point it out.Call Quality: Havent used this phone too much for calls about 2 hrs total? But havent had any complaints, audio quality through the phone is just average could be better could be worse.Overall I'll stay with my 5 star rating since this is the only phone of it's kind in this form factor I'm happy with it 80% of the time and the other 20% the grips bother me. The Z2c should be out soon if you want to wait for that hopefully within the next few months but once again it will probably command a hefty price tag like the Z2 around 650-700 at launch in that case the Z1c will be cheaper and I'd probably still recommend the Z1c in terms of value.  If you can afford it I'd wait for the Z2c and see what they come up with but if you chose the Z1c you will most likely be happy with it.Update: Reordered it New Z1c Impressions:I ordered the Z2 and while it's an awesome phone I felt as if it was too big barely I may get it again when the price goes down but as of now it's too big for me sometimes for everyday use...So I decided to give the Z1c another try and wow a lot of my impressions have changed.I'm pretty sure I got a different region this time as the box was different this one had the Brazil Fifa soccer logo on the back the 1st one didn't as far as I can tell the screen on this one is better, looks less washed out (Sony as well as other manufactures are known to use different LCD panels). The build quality also seems better on this version, the back doesnt feel as plasticy or cheap it feel much more premium. This makes sense since some people experience flash bleed issues when taking pictures due to the plastic backing where as some people don't the only explanation is that sony uses different plastic on some regions phones than others.These were two of my main gripes with the phone and makes the $450 price tag a bit more reasonable, if you're not happy with the version you get I suggest you return it and reorder it you may get a different regions and be happier. The Z1c right now fills niche that no other phone can fill there is no other ""compact phone"" that has flagship specs. Is the phone perfect no, the Z2 compact will most likely be my perfect phone I cant wait for it to come out...but it will most likely be priced similar the Z2 which is 650-700 initially so it will be a while until the price comes down in which I don't think it's worth the price difference. Overall I am really glad I decided to order the phone again I guess 2nd times the charm!Also side note: I'm not sure if I'm going to upgrade to kitkat some users have reported worse battery life after upgrading to kitkat while some have no once again people think it could be some regions phones. There's a thread on XDA worth checking out Sony is supposed to release an update next month, I also noticed this with the 1st phone I had where I was pretty disappointed with battery life after reading all the glowing reviews (that phone had kitkat preinstalled already)I've been following the Z1 compact for a while and finally decided to give it a shot once amazon had prime for it, I have to say there's a lot that Sony got right with this phone and a few things that they didnt. I've used the Z1 and felt it was too big and am currently using the LG G2, I wanted something smaller and more pocketable so I gave the Z1c a try. I'm sure everyone's watched and read reviews so I'll skip all that stuff and go straight to what I noticed.The screen, while it is improved it still isn't up to par with the G2, HTC One or S4 for that matter for some reason colors look a little washed out to me. While it is a good screen, I would say it's not on the level as the top tier phone (or last years now).The camera, the camera takes good outdoor pictures but just okay indoor ones I used the superior auto mode but honestly was a little disappointed with the camera, I use auto since 99% of the time I dont care to mess around the manual settings.Build Quality- This is probably the biggest disappointment for me, using the Z1 I was impressed by the build quality it felt premium and solid the Z1c on the other hand feels some what cheap (imo). The front feels hollow it's hard to explain but it almost feels plasticy the Z1 and HTC one have a harder screen that feels like glass, if you've used the iPad Air the front feels like that. The back is also really disappointing, Sony opted to use plastic instead of glass not sure why since the Z1 was glass and it was one of the 1st things I noticed. If this is supposed to be a no compromise smaller flagship it wouldv'e been nice to have the same build quality as the Z1, while it does look nice the in hand feel felt a little cheap to me but once again that's just my opinion.Battery life- Coming from the G2 and reading the reviews I expected really good battery life the phone has KitKat now and maybe that may contribute to the battery life not meeting my expectations but I would say it's good but not as good as my G2. I didnt have it on the charger and sleep for about 7 hrs I woke up with it dropping 10%. Hopefully it's in new phone mode right now and the battery improves over time but as of now I would say that battery is good not great, it was at 90% at 9 am now its at 67 at 1 pm I was in an area with bad signal so that has alot to do with it was well but ill update this after more time.SIgnal strength- I'm using Tmobile and while coverage isnt the best there's areas where I have less bars then I would have with my G2, not a major deal breaker but could be an issue depending where you live.Overall I will most likely return it I paid around 460 for it and I don't feel like it's quite worth the money, if it was at a lower price point around 350 then I might keep it but for now there's too many other better options in terms of full size phones I can get for that amount. It's a good phone but I would suggest waiting for the Z2 compact and hope that they address some of the issues.",5.0,1400889600,"05 24, 2014",SONY XPERIA Z1 COMPACT D5503 16GB WHITE FACTORY UNLOCKED LTE 4G 3G 2G GSM NEW (2G &amp; 3G 850/900/1700/1900/2100 &amp; 4G LTE 800/850/900/1700/1800/1900/2100/2600),412.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313Mss4AUcL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 4731},Sony,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

I am using magnetic cable to charge the phone, no issues there, I got two one for work and one for home, so I would recommend it as accessory (buy two instead of one docking station).I have never tested if this phone is really water resistant or not... kind of scary to test it.Annoying thing is the ""deleted"" photo thumbnail management, as they stay on the phone even when you delete the picture, you need to clear cache and restart the phone to get rid of unwanted thumbnails pictures.Calls are clear and I have LTE with T-mobile US in OR and NV.I would still recommend it to anyone who needs battery life and don't like big phones...##################################################################I am using this phone for 3 weeks and so far and it has frozen twice only :-), it has recovered it self though.... Why is this a positive? When it froze, I was really pressing opening, closing apps and buttons and scrolling all over the place, actually I was trying to overload it to see what will happen. a.k.a. hard core responsiveness test. It held fine... by normal use the phone don't freeze of course and is very very very responsive. As responsive as any iPhone... I tested it! I also have Samsung tablet and if I would do the same test of ""responsiveness"", the tablet won't survive it and freeze until restarted.This is my upgrade from nokia E6, too bad that nokia stopped the Symbian development. I was thinking to get an iPhone since the price is about same, but the battery life on iPhones is poor. - this phone is a iphone killer. I had the honor to test out Win8 phone and let me tell you that it is useless and I was most happy when I returned it back to the shop...I don't understand why the compact version of Z1 is not on sale officially in US in Tmobile or ATT etc... this could be a cash cow...One of my priorities was the battery life. with my normal usage the phone last for 2 days and on stamina mode even 2.75 up to 3 days (if I stretch it) which is close to what my old Nokia E6 was capable of. It says that the phone can be in stand-by mode for a week, never had the time to test it, but I will one day :-)...Second was the phone/display size. just perfect. I don't like the big phones....Third: open to all GSM, 3G, 4G frequencies (global phone). I am in OR on Tmobil network, and LTE/4G, 3G works fine on this phoneFourth: FM radio and Free offline world wide navigation.Overall: The phone is a solid build as described in other review. I put screen protector and cover from the day one, just buy it together to have the phone look new longer. I read that the display and phone back can be scratched easily so I just prevented it from occurring.I am not app fanatic, so don't have too many all kinds of apps on it, but I am using Skype, Free offline Navigation most time and for general web surfing. I prefer to use mobile web page for yahoo, facebook rather than an app for it. I don't mind the extra log in/password... The FM radio is nice feature that I am using daily instead of interned radio. Saves battery life and data too.I also have avast anti virus (free edition) and think about to upgrade to premium 15$ a year.Camera is definitely an upgrade from what I had, but if we need to take nice good quality pics, we use the DSLR camera and not a phone, but it is nice to have that handy. It says it has 21Mpx, but it can't compare with the DSLR of course.I also use this phone at work to sync my 2007 outlook calendar with the phone calendar (need those upcoming meeting reminders especially in meeting back to back..) I am using the exchange account setting sync over company wifi, to do that, which is fine. I know that there are apps out there that can do that too wireless.I will post an update in few months.I definitely recommend this phone over iPhone or any other 4in-isch smart phone.",5.0,1401062400,"05 26, 2014",SONY XPERIA Z1 COMPACT D5503 16GB WHITE FACTORY UNLOCKED LTE 4G 3G 2G GSM NEW (2G &amp; 3G 850/900/1700/1900/2100 &amp; 4G LTE 800/850/900/1700/1800/1900/2100/2600),412.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313Mss4AUcL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 4731},Sony,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"
