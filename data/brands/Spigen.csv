B008SGIQYK,A2ZR9V069NQZHB,82k,"[0, 0]",The anti glare on the Ultra Optics Dual is great and it helps prevent fingerprints. It comes with a back screen protector which was in 3 pieces and it just wasn't for me. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was because when you run your finger across the screen it makes noise. It gets annoying when you're in a quiet place and when you're just trying to wipe down your screen. I personally don't hear it unless it's silent but other than that it might annoy you and other people around you.,4.0,1371859200,"06 22, 2013","SPIGEN SGP iPhone 5 Screen Protector Clear Steinheil Ultra Crystal [2-Pack] film cover shield for AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, International - CLEAR",13.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sTgYmAzvL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 4440},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Screen Protectors']]"
B008SGIQYK,AIBFSUAOAQVZY,Aaron S.,"[2, 3]","I actually emailed the company first to try and not write a bad review for a company that normally has great screen protectors.On that note, the front screen protector fitted perfect and was crystal clear with no bubbles, with minimum fuss.The back three pieces however are all slightly too small, especially the top and bottom clear protectors.  If I would have known this, I would have lined up the edges so my bumper would cover where the protector didn't reach.The matte finish was nice, but it seemed to have more trouble with bubbles than the front.  The apple logo and writing is of course raised so you can easily see that there is a protector on.  It doesn't go flush like the picture on Amazon.The biggest issue for me was getting a lone piece of dirt or hair under the protectors once they were down.  For example, there was a little dirt that made it on at the last moment on the back, so I pulled it up from the edge, and used the lent sticker to get the dirt off, then put the screen back down.  The bubble was gone but the edge I pulled back wouldn't go down.  This happened to me on three different edges, two on the back, and one on the front.  This was on a brand new iphone 5, I pulled of the manufacturer plastic and put on the protectors.  I have also used SGP screens in the past with no problems.Update: SGP did send a replacement.  It had the exact same issue, one corner doesn't stay down.  I didn't even bother with the back, just left on the old ones because I had a feeling the new ones would be identical.  I do have to say that the front is very very clear and is the best screen protector I've seen.  Just be very careful when you lay any of them down, because you can't get anything out without jacking up the edges.",2.0,1350259200,"10 15, 2012","SPIGEN SGP iPhone 5 Screen Protector Clear Steinheil Ultra Crystal [2-Pack] film cover shield for AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, International - CLEAR",13.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sTgYmAzvL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 4440},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Screen Protectors']]"

It doesn't eliminate all fingerprints, but it does make it very easy to wipe them off.  The protector doesn't affect the Retina screen like other anti-glare protectors.It's true that there's a slight squeaky sound when you swipe your finger across the screen, but not very noticeable unless if you swipe your finger with a lot of force.As for applying the protector on the screen, not much different or difficult than any other SGP protectors, so if you are used to applying screen protectors before, then you shouldn't find any difficulty with this one.Overall this is a good combination of price and quality.",5.0,1356912000,"12 31, 2012","SPIGEN SGP iPhone 5 Screen Protector Clear Steinheil Ultra Crystal [2-Pack] film cover shield for AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, International - CLEAR",13.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sTgYmAzvL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 4440},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Screen Protectors']]"

Its best to plan ahead so you know what your doing.- Be patient - make sure you have time when you are doing this. Its best to take your time on screan protectors like this because these could last forever.- CLEAN THE SCREEN - I cannot stress this enough.

B008SGIQYK,A3G8ADZRM8POXU,M. Caswell,"[1, 1]","The iPhone 5 is my 4th iPhone, and I've never used a screen protector because I had seen some devices with screen protectors in place, and they looked annoyingly bad.  But I decided to give this one a try, and was pleasantly surprised... it truly does look almost imperceptible.  I cannot see any negative affect on the image quality of the screen, and the only visible evidence that the screen protector is in place is around the speaker/camera and, to a lesser extent, the home button (in particular, you can see the edge of the cutouts... it's certainly not offensive looking, but if you know it's there, you see it).However, it did take some work to install to this level of satisfaction.  I spent probably 20 - 30 minutes getting it perfect.  I used the ""hinge method"" that I found mentioned in a forum.  Rather than just trying to place the protector freehand, or lining it up at the top and hoping the home button cutout ended up in the right place, I instead kept the overlay films in place, and after positioning the protector perfectly, secured it along the side with blue painter's tape, creating a ""hinge"" that enabled me to flip it out of the way but still retain the carefully attained position.  After verifying and correcting the position several times, and cleaning the screen thoroughly and meticulously until all traces of dust/lint were gone, I then peeled off the back overlay film, and applied the protector.Despite my efforts, there were still a few dust specks, but I was able to use the supplied tape strips (presumably the blue painter's tape would work too) to partially lift the protector and dab off the dust/lint with another piece of tape.  Took a while to get it completely dust-free, but the end result was worth it.  And the great thing is that since I didn't screw it up, I now have an extra that I can use in a year or so.My only somewhat negative observation was that at first, it felt a bit ""sticky""... when I slid the unlock button over, I could feel some resistance and a distinct ""squeaky"" kind of feeling.  However, interestingly, this effect seems to have greatly diminished since it was first installed yesterday, to the point where I simply don't feel it anymore.  I suspect that the stickiness was just the nature of the newly manufactured material, and just needed to be ""broken in"" a bit with use.",5.0,1349222400,"10 3, 2012","SPIGEN SGP iPhone 5 Screen Protector Clear Steinheil Ultra Crystal [2-Pack] film cover shield for AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, International - CLEAR",13.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sTgYmAzvL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 4440},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Screen Protectors']]"

I peeled off the side labeled 1, I think it said ""front"", thinking that this was the side that sticks onto the screen.  Well, I was wrong.  Everything is reversed.  Anyways, I ended up trashing the screen protector thinking that there was no way that I'd be able to get all of the lint off of the sticky side.  The next morning, I woke up and dug the screen protector out of the trash can.  I used some liquid dishwashing soap and washed the screen protector down and fanned it dry.  It totally worked.I installed it correctly this time.  Bottom of the protector first, then I used a credit card to ""squeegee""  the screen protector to the top.  I have one small little bubble on the bottom of the screen, but everything else looks great considering that it was in the trashcan with bacon grease all over it the day before.Anyways, I've tried both Power Support and Generiks on my iphone 4, and I must say that this crystal clear screen protector is pretty good.

B008SGIQYK,A2FKR2PS626LL5,Mr. Walker,"[5, 5]","Okay, if you are looking for a matte finish screen protector for iPhone 5 (or I suppose 4 or 4s), let me help you out.Let me start by saying I have applied a LOT of screen protectors over the years, way back from Handspring Visor to Sony Clie to Palm TX to iPod nanos and Touches, as well as digital camera screens. The protectors get better with time. The clear gloss ones are a pain in the butt to get the bubbles out.I like the matte finish as it really decreases fingerprints and helps screen visibility. You may lose some resolution, but only slightly. So here goes.This Spigen Ultra-Fine ""anti-fingerprint"" screen protector for iPhone 5 is AWESOME. I had just purchased a Belkin matte screen protector to try it out for the past week. Compared to this new Spigen, the Belkin one makes the screen less clear and more slightly yellow, and actually is not that smooth of surface. Of note, I am using a Speck Candyshell case and both screen protectors fit fine inside the top surface, without bubbling. (if it does bubble any, you can push them out with a soft shirt/squeegee card/etc., toward the outer edge)This Spigen protector is super-smooth to run your finger across. When you feel it you'll know. The cutouts line up perfectly with the screen camera, ear speaker, and home button. The clarity is very good, and it cleans off easily. Prior to this, on 2 previous iPod Touch models I used the Power Support Anti-Glare HD screen protector from the Apple store, and it is awesome as well. I used each one for 2 years and they hardly look used at all.Comparing the PowerSupport next to me with this new Spigen, the PowerSupport film is slightly smoother/glassier feel, but it has been in use x 2 years. Both are smooth, decrease glare, and have great light transmittance and resolution.INSTALL HELP:Okay, I was nervous taking the Belkin screen film off since I had it perfectly aligned, no bubbles, no dust under it. But I bit the bullet, and am GLAD I changed to the Spigen.The first install attempt with the Spigen I started from the top edge. I only peeled back about 1/3 of the back film, lined up the top edge, and then squeegee out the bubbles as I unpeel it, applying it down the front. Well, at the bottom the home button cutout ended up crooked. Darn it!So, what I did is get a small piece of Scotch tape, stick it on the corner of the screen protector, and carefully peeled it up (that is the easiest way to get a grip on it). Then at the top I slightly adjusted it, then did the apply/squeege combo motion again. This lined up just right, but I had 2 pc. of dust under it!So then, I got a new piece of Scotch tape, and lightly touched it (sticky side) against the spots on the back of the screen protector to grab those dust specks. It worked great, and now it's on, and it looks and FEELS awesome. I'm so glad I put it on.SO THEN, in SUMMARY:This Spigen, and the Power Support HD anti-glare, are excellent screen protectors. They transmit light well, block glare, clean easily, and are very smooth and responsive to the touch. I realize they are a little more expensive, but you get 2 of them - and you never have to replace it. Get it set up, and you are done.Of note, they do a great job protecting the screen, but a hot object hit my ipod screen (an ejected shell casing) and left a nick because it melted the screen protector - but no damage to the glass.Sorry for long review, but I wanted to make it ""crystal clear"" (actually matte clear) as to why this is a great screen protector as well as how to help you apply it perfectly.

When I first got my iPhone5 the only SPs available were the Verizon branded ones.  While they do protect the screen, they're junk when it comes to fingerprints and smudging. And while I've liked my Crystal Clear SGPs in the past, I thought I'd try the SGP Oleophobic this time - a clear SP, but with a bit of fingerprint control (without the rainbow or blurriness of the anti-fingerprint style).I have to say I think the Oleophobic hits the perfect balance of visibility and fingerprint control.  Yes, you can (and will) still get fingerprints, but WAY less than the standard SPs (like the Verizon ones). I get very few, and it's easy to wipe completely clean without smearing. And the feel of the plastic is great, very glassy and not tacky feeling at all.The fit is also perfect and works great with my bumper case. Much better (and tighter) adhering than the other screen protector - never a hint of it bubbling at the edges, and I take the case on and off a lot too.My only ""problem"" was that SGP sent me 2 packages - I assume because they slightly adjusted the sizing after the iPhone5 came out.

I noticed minimal degradation in quality and although the install was tedious I got great results.Over the years I have installed at least a dozen different protective films in iPhones and iPads. If there's anything at all that I've learned is that they are all a total and completely pain to install. And that's perfectly normal when you consider that you are installing a small piece of adhesive (or not) film that has 2 or more precisely cut openings that need to match perfectly. On top of that specks of dust will leave bubbles that don't go away by themselves and require lifting the film, removing the dust with an adhesive strip and then re-positioning the film.So when I read customer complaints I can empathize and I also think that it's usually because the user has some unrealistic expectations about how long it'll take to install the film.The SPIGEN SGP iPhone 5 Screen Protector Clear is one of the better films I've tried (I also like PowerSupport). You get two in the package so if you really mess up you can try again.

I have a suggestion for putting on the screen protector to ensure that there are no bubbles.1) Without removing the backing, place the protector over the screen in such a way that the peel sticker is on the screen side towards the right.2) Make sure that the protector is perfectly aligned over the screen, and tape the protector to the screen from one of the longer rectangular sides. This tape will act as a hinge.3) Move the protector to the side, off of the screen.4) Wipe the screen. Be sure to remove any dust, fingerprints, or oil.5) Carefully remove the peel sticker on the protector.6) Move the protector back on to the screen. Because of the tape, the protector will go perfectly into place.7) Use the provided squigee (or a card) to remove any bubbles.8) If there is any dust, peel off the protector using a piece of scotch tape on the corner and use the provided dust stickers.Overall, I am satisfied with the protector. I have no bubbles and the screen is beautiful and displays no fingerprints! The screen feels slightly different (more like the screen of a PC monitor) but I feel that this is a plus. The protector does not interfere with brightness and is quite clear.",5.0,1354320000,"12 1, 2012","SPIGEN SGP iPhone 5 Screen Protector Clear Steinheil Ultra Crystal [2-Pack] film cover shield for AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, International - CLEAR",13.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sTgYmAzvL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 4440},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Screen Protectors']]"

I originally had a Skinomi installed and that was also a great product but its thickness caused it to lift with the majority of my cases(except for my Commuter and Spigen Neo Hybrid).  Maybe because it was a wet application screen protector.Pros:  98% clarity.  You can barely....and I mean barely noticed the texture of the screen protector.  It has like a microscopic bead texture to it.  It feels real nice in hand and is very responsive even to the slightest touch/swipe.  Also, it makes whatever your viewing a lot smoother.  Looks great with iOS7 and their colorful icons.  Aside from its feel, you can barely tell it's on.Cons:  Not really a con but it squeaks when you swipe through screens.  I actually don't mind it as I know it's just the protectors' texture.  I would rather have that squeaking sound over the matte feel of other screen protectors.  The included rear protectors are three clear pieces.  I kind of wish the rear protector was one piece instead of three but it looks fine.  No problem on the installInstallation: NOW I know why Spigen is considered one of the best.  Install went very smooth.  Only one speck got on the front protector but I used the included tape to lift it and another to retrieve the speck.  Other than that, it was a bubble free install starting with the front facing camera and working down towards the home button.  I installed mine in the bathroom with the shower running but be careful turning the bathroom into a steam room.  With too much steam it'll cause a rainbow effect to appear under the protector.Overall all a great product from Spigen.  I'm currently rockin' the Neo Hybrid(another great product) and these front & back screen protectors work fantastic together.I look forward to trying new Spigen products in the near future(I buy a new product for phones about every week ....accessorizing my iPhone 5 is my passion).OLEOPHOBIC's Review:If you're looking for a screen protector(SP) that looks like nothing is installed; the Oleophobic is the one for you.  Spigen's Ultra Optics Dual is also a good protector cause of its texture but the Oleophobic may offer 100% clarity.  The install was smooth, one small speck that was removed using the included tape.  I installed it while at a restuarant(not recommended---use the bathroom method for a perfect install) and it STILL came out awesome!  At first it felt a little sticky but I think it was from the residue from the ""front"" film which gets removed after install.  After a quick wipe, it felt amazing!",5.0,1380153600,"09 26, 2013","SPIGEN SGP iPhone 5 Screen Protector Clear Steinheil Ultra Crystal [2-Pack] film cover shield for AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, International - CLEAR",13.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sTgYmAzvL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 4440},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Screen Protectors']]"

Compared to a matte screen protector (my dad has one), I'm happier with mine because it's so clear.I'm using the Belkin Grip Candy Sheer case and it looks like the case edge ends right where the screen protector does, so there will probably be lint/dirt trapped in there, but it's too early to tell.

I am NOT affiliated with this company whatsoever.I bought this the first time last November 27, 2012 since I'm a big fan of bumper cases and the color yellow. with a little bit of research and faith, I finally decided to get this and loved it! My dad loved it so I gave him mine instead. This month, I decided to get another one since I really loved everything about this case. Turns out, when I received and opened the package, It was as improved model!Pros:-The Bumper case is thinner now, but still gives a ""lay on the table"" design, so even if you put your iPhone 5 front screen down first, it wouldn't scratch.-feedback on the power and volume buttons are better and I like how they changed the color of the rubber from grey to black-since its color yellow, even if it scratches, its not noticeable at all.-comes in with a FRONT and BACK Screen Protector (the front screen protector is a clear one & the back screen protector is a three-piece, matte type.)now for the cons:-This case comes with a lot of freebies, but I really hate how they included the jelly bean buttons. I know it's optional to put it on, but if you do, its really awkward to press, plus if you place it just a little bit out from the home button, it would be just horrible. Also, its a pain to remove and leaves sticky residues.

B00AG1A6N4,A2YZVO7HB60BO3,"Thomasj106 ""Thomasj106""","[0, 1]","I really like the case.  It's very thin and the design is extremely close to Apple's look and design of the actual iPhone.  This product comes with beautiful screen protectors for the front and back.  The ONLY two drawbacks I have with this product is almost every manufacturer of screen protectors and skins will guarantee not only their product's functionality, but also even your ability to install it correctly.  I have installed dozens of skins from a variety of manufacturers on my own devices as well as family/friends devices.  Everyone wants me to install theirs because I get them on perfectly.  And almost always without a problem.  I'm really anal about getting them on super straight and even more anal about getting them on without dust, dirt, or even an air bubble under them.  But even then, sometimes things happen.  Usually if you screw up during installation most manufacturers will replace the skin even if you were the one who destroyed trying to put it on.It just so happens that I payed a lot of money for this case and the skins that came with it.  It also just so happened that when I was getting ready to install the front  screen skin it popped out of my hands and landed on the floor in my kitchen.  Now we keep our house extremely clean.  However, the floor in an operating room in a hospital is not even clean enough for a self adhering screen protector to have land on it. So naturally there were now specs of whatever all stuck to it.  I rinsed the screen protector off under cool water taking a lot of extra care not to damage or scratch the adhesive on the protector in the process.I have several bottles of screen protector solution (that not only lubricates but cleans as well) in my desk draw so I did my very best to make sure the protector was absolutely clean before installing it.  Even with as much effort and care as I put into cleaning it, there were three tiny specs of whatever still stuck to the protector that you can see when installed on the phone.  I carefully removed the skin from the phone and cleaned it again.  And again.  And again.  In the process I got two of the specs off but not without first scratching the adhesive.  I knew it!  I wound up just leaving the third spec as it is just because of the damage I did to trying to get the other two off.  I installed it for the last time.  The two scratches are VERY visible as is the third spec on the black band up near the receiver and front facing camera.  Of course it couldn't be somewhere in the actual screen area where it would be less noticeable when the phone is on.Now I realize that NONE of this is Spigen's fault.  I have no one to blame but myself.  But what can you do?  $hlt happens.  But at $32 you would think that Spigen would be nice enough to extend the courtesy of a replacement screen protector even though they weren't the one to destroy it.  Another nice thing about companies that extend that courtesy is that there are times when your device dies and has to be replaced.  Sometimes removal and reinstallation of the skin is not able to be done correctly or without some sort of damage to it.  Say you are away on vacation.  You drop your iphone in the water at the beach.  You take it the Apple store to get a new phone.  They are not going to R&R; your screen protector for you there.  You will have to remove it and replace it yourself under less than optimal conditions.  That protector is going to get ruined.  Almost every other manufacturer will replace that protector for you out of customer courtesy.  So my next choice will probably not be another Spigen for just that very reason.The second drawback is this:  The three piece rear protector that's included with is case is beautifully designed.  The texture and look mimic's Apple's Glass-Aluminum-Glass look and feel incredibly well.  However the center piece is slightly too small so you either have to split the difference with the center skin and bottom skin or have the bottom skin make up the difference entirely and have it fall short of the outer band.  I split the difference between the center skin and the bottom.  I could not move the top skin down to split the differences between all three, which would have been better, but if I had done that then I would have moved the skin too low and have it wind up in the rear camera's lens area.  That was not an option.  The seam where the the top skin and the center skin meet is absolutely PERFECT.  You cannot see nor feel the seem if installed correctly.  Amazing!  However, because the bottom skin does not fit tight against the short center skin, you can see and feel the gap between those two.  This is what happens when you are this anal about stuff, are a perfectionist, and expect everything to be perfect.  Life is less than perfect.  Even at $32.",4.0,1359849600,"02 3, 2013","iPhone 5S Case, Spigen Neo Hybrid EX Slim Vivid Case for iPhone 5S/5 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Dante Red (SGP10026)",25.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/311qDbLjRwL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 86540},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"
B00AG1A6N4,AH0DR4U0PVC13,Tyler Brown,"[1, 2]","I hate phone cases, but I've been really paranoid ever since I dropped my iPhone on the cement the other day..  So I decided I needed something to help protect my phone.  I had a bumper by Apple for my iPhone 4, and it was solid and I loved it!!  So I decided I wanted a bumper-type case instead of a full body case.  Since Apple isn't making a bumper for the iPhone 5, after lots of research, I bought this one....PROS: Good looking, very low profile and thin (doesn't add any bulk or weight to your phone), sticks up a little higher than front and back screens for protection, all buttons, jacks, and lightning hole are easily accessible, and it's pretty easy to put on.CONS: Doesn't fit tight enough around the phone, very flimsy and uncomfortable feeling, first sleeve is silicon, so it feels a lot more like plastic than rubber, and it peeled up the edges of my ZAGG invisibleSHIELD on the front and back.  This case also comes with three little jelly button stickers, and they are really hard to stick on straight and they can't be reapplied once stuck on.Not a terrible bumper case, but I'm sure there are tons of sturdier, tighter-fitting bumpers out there for the iPhone 5.  This case is pretty inexpensive compared to other iPhone 5 cases, but for as flimsy as this case is, it seems a bit overpriced.  Overall, this really isn't a terrible bumper, but if you're like me and want a tight-fitting bumper that feels more natural to the iPhone, this probably isn't the one for you.Oh, and also...  I wanted to return this item for a refund, but my product didn't come with a receipt, so now I'm stuck with it...

B00BGG5LO2,A2NPOQXJDJVN0W,Joe R,"[0, 0]","Spigen is brand that I have had several cases from and have never had any issues. I recently upgraded from a black iPhone to a white one, and decided it was time to upgrade the case as well.I am a huge fan of shell cases because they are thin and do not add unnecessary bulk to the phone. This case fits that perfectly. It is not an Otterbox, and it will not defend your phone the same as an Otterbox, but the tradeoff is thin or bulky.My iPhone is a White Silver 5S and this case, as they said it would, matches the color perfectly. The back of the case is made out of metal which in my opinion adds a reinforced structure to the shell. The back does have a slight texture to it, but it's something that is very minimal and likely to go unnoticed. I have also noticed that the back does not scratch, at least not very easily. I have owned it for a few weeks now without even the slightest scratch, it still looks brand new.The cutouts on the side for the volume buttons and vibrate/ring switch are plenty big so that you do not need to use the tip of your finger and try your hardest to push the buttons.As other reviewers have mentioned, the case does not have a lip that comes over the screen of the phone. It is raised up ever so slightly, but if you drop it directly on its face the glass could crack, again a risk you're taking by not buying a bulky Otterbox.Overall I love the case and I know that Spigen is a great brand that produces awesome products. Looks great on my iPhone and gives it the right amount of protection that I want.",5.0,1396396800,"04 2, 2014","iPhone 5S Case, Spigen Saturn Case for iPhone 5S/5 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Satin Silver (SGP10141)",17.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51zeIG5NyUL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8609},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

I got so many compliments on this case while I was using it with the most frequent comment being, ""wait... I didn't even notice there was a case on your phone at first."" The case offers good protection for the back and sides of the phone but that's really where it ends.  The fatal flaw of the case is that with no lip on the front and no top and bottom edge, aside from protecting the aluminum from getting scratched, this case won't do much for your phone in a drop.

I personally am not a bulky/rugged/massive protection case person because I do not like the added bulk, weight and overall design and ergonomics those cases. I am familiar with Spigen Cases and they have quality products at an affordable price.--------------------PROTECTION--------------------Like I stated in my overview, this is a slim and sleek case and I did not expect it to provide military grade protection, or even small child protection for that matter. The case adds minimal thickness/bulk to the iPhone 5s which is great. The case snaps on the rear and really only protects the rear/back and sides of the iPhone 5s, nothing more so don't expect or assume screen protection of any sort with this case.What I also loved about the case is that I have my iPhone 5s wrapped in a full body skin to protect from just scratches and this doesn't ruin the skin. It snaps directly over it with no issues of it pushing the edges of the skin off.--------------------------DROPPED iPhone--------------------------While I use my iPhone 5s, my 6 year old daughter uses it on occasions and frequently drops and mishandles the iPhone. She has dropped it on a few occasions (mostly indoors) while the case was on and it has kept the iPhone 5s front scratches, dents and dings which is sufficient and what I expect out of this case. I was not let down.-------------------------------PRODUCT FEATURES-------------------------------- Give your iPhone 5/5S an Outfit! Polycarbonate and solid aluminum plate creates a modern hybrid design.- Protection without the bulk: Ultra Slim case offers corner and scratch protection, as well as a slight lift to allow your iPhone 5/5S to be put screen-side down on a flat surface.- Anti-Ghost Camera Cutout allows the camera and flash to be used without any interference from the case.- Direct access to all buttons and ports on your iPhone 5/5S; designed by Spigen in California and made in Korea to ensure the use of non-hazardous chemicals.- Disclaimer: Product color may vary due to lighting, screen pixel quality and color settings. Due to camera flash, shadows may exist in photos.------------------------SLICK/SLIPPERY------------------------A lot of cases and screen protectors I review can be rather slick and causes devices to slip from my hand more so than not protecting the device at all. I was actually surprise this was not an issue with this case.-------------------PROS/CONS-------------------PROS- Price- Special Coating- Precision Fit- Super Slim Design- Quality Control- Build/Quality- Color Selection- Works with SOME Full Body Skins such as Skinomi, IQ Shield, Zagg, Etc.- Sufficient Protection- Works with iPhone 5 and 5s- Prompt Customer ServiceCONS- Although &#34;slim&#34; still adds bulk/depth to the iPhone",5.0,1395705600,"03 25, 2014","iPhone 5S Case, Spigen Saturn Case for iPhone 5S/5 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Satin Silver (SGP10141)",17.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51zeIG5NyUL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8609},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

It comes in a fancy plastic box that requires a little thought to get into but it is exactly what I ordered.  If your looking for anything beyond basic protection then this case isn't for you; if you are prone to drop your phones this case isn't for you.  The protection is minimal, it may protect your phone if you drop it a couple feet onto the corner but there is no lip around the screen so it is completely exposed.  Lets be honest, its just a decorative case.  I'm not knocking the case at all, I rarely drop my phones I can't stand bulky protective cases, the Otterbox Commuter is way too bulky for me.  I just want basic protection and something that protect from scratches in my pocket, My favorite case is probably the Otterbox Reflex but the bottom of them is very flimsy and breaks just from normal use.

Not to mention that the screen protector looks nearly invisible and feels as though it's hardly there. Also, when I installed mine, I had hardly to any air bubbles, which I find so annoying to get rid of!

B00BPDYVDS,A1WF4QNIE2Z3I7,N's Gadget Reviews,"[0, 0]","I hate screen protectors in general because they generally look fuzzy to me. The S4 has an amazingly clear screen, but it's plastic, so I also didn't want it scratched up.To install this, you simply line it up, put a piece of clear tape on the left or right side once you have it where you want it, readjust if necessary, then just peel the liners off and set it down. I've installed 2 and with this method I got either no bubbles or a very small one that eventually worked its way out on the edge.As for protection, my phone rides in a pants pocket with keys and all sorts of sharp things, a year later - no scratches whatsoever on the underlying screen. The protector itself is pretty hard to scratch, I think I had one tiny little scratch after over a year of keys against it in my pocket. When I say tiny, I mean, not visible without actually looking for it.It does clean up pretty easily, but yes, just like any screen, it'll smudge and such with use. I don't find it a big problem though.All cut outs were where you'd want them to be.As far clarity, this is easily the clearest screen protector I've ever seen (and I'm picky about that sort of thing).",5.0,1392595200,"02 17, 2014","Galaxy S4 Screen Protector, Spigen Steinheil Screen Protector for Galaxy S4 - Retail Packaging - Ultra Crystal (SGP10174)",9.26,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AcDgoQG0L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 6094},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Screen Protectors']]"

B00BPDYVDS,A3I7KHL86ENRVP,R. Sheriff,"[0, 0]","I have used screen protectors in the past on my Blackberry and on my Samsung Galaxy Epic 4G so I am familiar with the basics of a screen protector.  In my research Spigen came up multiple times as a quality product, my evaluation so far is not contradictory to that estimation.  The instructions were clear and concise, the packaging included a microfiber cloth and a squeegee, although I would have liked a alcohol swab as well.  The cut is amazing, and the fit it perfect, the actual screen protector is cut slightly smaller than the housing of the phone, this is done on purpose and this is indicated on the instructions.  I laid the protector on the top, aligned it and pulled the backing off, for the most part it self sealed leaving only two small air bubbles for me to work out with the squeegee.  The clarity is the same as the naked screen, now that it is on I visually can not tell the screen protector is on.  The feel of the screen has dynamically changed however, this is why I gave the product 4 stars.  The naked S4 screen is very slick and smooth, but after applying the protector is feels like there is a bit of resistance to my swiping. it's almost like a matte rubber feel, it's not a hindrance to sensitivity or touch responsiveness it just feels different to my fingers.  I am sure with time I will acclimate to the feel and won't notice it.  All in all I believe the protection provided outweighs the small change in the feel of the glass.  This is a temporary solution as I plan to replace this protector with a Spigen GLAS.t Premium Tempered Glass screen protector in the future.*!*UPDATE*!*After using the phone for a bit the feel returns almost completely to the slick naked screen feel.  My wife installed the second protector on her phone and I advised after removing the top applicator plastic to wipe the screen down with the microfiber cloth.  This returned her screen to almost naked feel immediately.  It may be a residue left over from the applicator film that I was feeling.  the screen is smooth and feels 98% back to naked.

This impedes the flow/ease of use on the device.  This ALL glass protector feels JUST AS SMOOTH as the original glass. I can't say if smoother or not, but it certainly feels very smooth.  The oil phobic coating on this protector will cause your fingers to skip if there is excessive oil residue on your fingers.  Once your hands are relately oil free, it is silky smooth.  I will caution you on installation. With this protector, it PRETTY much is ONE install.  So the device screen MUST be completely clean and free of any debris.  During my install, a random fuzzy hair somehow appeared at the top right corner (mostly in the white area just below the sensors) that I cannot remove. I &#34;could&#34; send this in and have company &#34;replace&#34; it for half the cost but it's not really worth it at this point.

B00BSDSDSO,A1DUOR079P5LGW,Ee Ling,"[0, 0]","I'm a big fan of Spigen/Steinheil film screen protectors, but I'm just going to stick with the glass ones from now on. The glass provides a very smooth surface for using my S4 - everything feels very slick and responsive. The glass screen protector also picks up a lot less fingerprints than normal clear screen protectors. Which means that it's perfect for anyone who wants to retain the high definition of their screen (I've never understood matte/anti-fingerprint screen protectors, why would you want to make your magnificent phone screen appear all fuzzy).The application for this went much more smoothly than I'd thought - once I'd made sure the screen was free from dust, it went on pretty easily, no adjustments needed.The glass is ever so slightly visible since it doesn't cover the speakers at the top but to me, it's barely noticeable and the smoothness + anti-fingerprint nature of the glass is more important, anyway.(Update) I bought another one because I had a tiny crack at one corner from dropping my phone*. The rest of the screen protector didn't shatter, and I felt reasonably sure that my screen itself was alright. Got a little annoyed with the crack so I decided to install the new glass protector. And as a testament to how good the adhesive is, it took me a good five minutes to pry off the protector. And yep, my phone screen was still perfect - no cracks at all. Once I had removed it, I lined up the new protector with trepidation - I had been reluctant to install a new one since the first one had gone on so perfectly. What if I botched this one? Fortunately, it was as easy to install as the first time - I realise that it's probably because there's something you can actually hold on to to line it up with your phone.Bottomline:a) It protects your screen from shattering.b) It is easy to install.c) It's smooth and you can barely tell that you have anything on your phone screen.d) It helps keep off fingerprints.e) You should just buy it already.*Note: The crack happened when I dropped the phone with a Spigen Slim Armour case on. I've since dropped my phone at least a dozen times more with other cases, and no other cracks have appeared.

B00BSDSDSO,A1TF2V2DMMLG47,grumble,"[0, 0]","I have nothing but praise for the Glas.tR for the Samsung Galaxy S4. Because the glass on the phone is perfectly flat, the screen cover covers the entirety of the edge to edge glass while leaving open the front speaker grill, three of the sensors and the homebutton. I've only had it for a little bit so I can't say anything about the durability, but the look and feel is just amazing. You can't even tell that you're touching a screen cover as opposed to the actual phone.Because the home button sticks out a bit on the actual phone, pressing the home button with Glas.tR isn't difficult, though it is a little recessed. I used Spigen's Aluminum Home Button Sticker and it fits perfectly within the cutout for the home button, which I highly recommend (because the jelly buttons are pretty ugly) but otherwise, stickers aren't really necessary.The screen, back and menu buttons suffer no loss in sensitivity, or a loss so small that you can't even notice. The camera sees perfectly fine and the notification light is still really bright. The screen still looks vibrant and colorful with no loss in performance.However, you should definitely buy a case with this to prevent chipping. I have Spigen's Neo Hybrid and it fits perfectly around the border of the Glas.tR, but because the cover's thickness, there isn't much of a lip and I wouldn't put the phone face down.An overall great buy, 10/10 definitely recommended.",5.0,1369094400,"05 21, 2013","Galaxy S4 Screen Protector, Spigen GLAS.tR SLIM Premium Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Galaxy S4 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging (SGP10178)",21.2,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TMa3f3fEL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3388},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Screen Protectors']]"

I love that the volume and power buttons slightly stick out making them perfectly accessible and responsive. The cut outs are almost so precise, that you'd think that it was the phone itself. The case feels nice in the hand but I wish it had a bit more grip. Could use just a little strip of rubber on the sides maybe or they could have slightly textured the sides just a bit. The ONLY things that I really hate (HATE) is that it is kind of an smudge/grease magnet and the case scuffs from just daily use. I found that I was constantly making sure there was nothing in my pockets to scuff it, also I was consciously making sure I placed it facing down instead of laying it on its back. I felt the nag of taking care of my nice case. I ended up buying a UAG case (also in slate blue) because it bugged me so much. I occasionally put this back on, but I wish so bad that it had the classy yet rugged feel of my Urban Armor Gear case. The UAG is basically smudge proof and very scratch resistant. If this had the same type of feel to the back as my UAG, it'd be in my top ten favorite cases of all time. I've  owned over 650 cases from the early iPhone /EVO days to now. I'm a case nut. Before another company bought it out, I actually used to have my own website and sold cell phone cases for a living, so technically I've had thousands of phone cases. Anyways for me to say that this would be one of my all time favorite cases if the back was a lot more scratch and smudge proof, is a big deal because (to make a simple understatement) I'm very picky, almost obsessive, when it comes to phone cases.

So, I am concerned that if phone drops flat on the screen or on an uneven surface (for example, gravel) there's a possibility the screen will scratch or crack. Along with others, I would recommend a screen protector as a 'must have'.Overall, it is otherwise very attractive and nicely constructed and all button pushing functions work well.  In my opinion, it is also one of the most stylish cases on the market.I believe it more attractive and stylish than the Acase Superleggera Pro or the Otterbox Commuter, both of which I also own.  But they provide greater overall protection to the screen area.  I do not share such concern with those cases because the 'lip' surrounding is higher, and more likely to absorb the impact of a fall where the screen comes into contact with the surface.Hence, I rate this case 3-Stars, otherwise 5-Stars in all other respects.I am definitely keeping this as I also purchased it on a 'Flash Sale'-well worth it at that very low price. It's also worth it at the regular Amazon price which is currently $14.99...but I'm not buying another.  Why?  There's more 'risk' if you drop it.

I was able to use all of my OEM and aftermarket power charger cables with the phone in the case (a problem with other models).  The black exterior case cover is very high gloss black and VERY thin.  If you want to keep the very thin profile of the S4 while maintaining a high level of impact and tactile protection then this is the case for you.The front bezel of the case wraps around just barely enough to keep the phone screen from touching when laid face down.  The bezel also covers just barely past the chrome lip all the way around the front of the phone, so you can use almost any screen protector (don't leave your hyper-smudging greasy-finger loving gorilla glass bare)Just like other Spigen cases it includes a color-matching sticker for the HOME button, but I never use them.The hard exterior case piece is impact resistance plastic and very glossy so I'm pretty sure all the colors available will show finger prints just as badly as my black case cover.All-in-all, I've bought dozens of cases for my S3 and the Spigen models are my favorite.",5.0,1387238400,"12 17, 2013","Galaxy S4 Case, Spigen Slim Armor Case for Galaxy S4 - Retail Packaging - Dodger Blue (SGP10205)",19.26,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41uBkgej0nL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2656},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

I hadn't ever heard of Spigen when I searched for a case for my Galaxy S4 but this time the risk paid off. The Slim Armor is exactly that, slim and protective. This case is the Anti-Otterbox bulky case that most Apple IPhone users choose. Why purchase a phone that is slim if you plan on making it 4 times larger by adding a bulky case? This is a problem that you won't face with the Spigen SGP Samsung Galaxy S4 Slim Armor. The fact that it's slim is accompanied by the fact that the case actually feels sturdy in your hand while looking good. If you are going to get the Galaxy S4 the Spigen Slim Armor is a wise choice for a case that is protective and compliments the phone very well.

B00BW6GH76,A2LCE1D0TW2XY0,D. Alexander,"[0, 0]","I bought the matte blue version of this case. First point of note: choose gloss. It may show fingerprints more readily, but it also won't be nearly as slippery. If not for the additional thickness of this case, the bare Galaxy S4 would be easier to hold.Aesthetics are very nice. The edge minimalist lip sits tight against the screen surface. The join areas between the rubber and the plastic on the back are nearly perfect.I don't care for a few things about it. First, the back side is thicker than necessary and adds bulk to the phone. From the camera lens to the end of the plastic is 2-3mm, and the camera already protrudes on the bare S4. I suppose it could be nice if you dropped the phone on a sharp object that hit the back dead center, but otherwise, it's just unnecessary. The handset feels noticeable thicker in a pocket. Someone pointed out the protruding buttons. I don't mind those. They haven't caught on the edges of my pockets. Given how recessed the S4's buttons are, the rubber actually makes them a bit easier to press.It also doesn't fit any of my USB charging or 3.5mm audio cables. The holes aren't big enough. And these are pretty typical cheap cables from places like Monoprice, I didn't buy a bunch of oddballs.The last reason is more basic: it doesn't fit the phone. The case is slightly too long. I can see the metallic lip of the S4 on one side and it's very easy to push back the rubber lip from the edge of a corner. So easy that if the phone landed face-down on a corner, I'm certain the impact would push the rubber back and the phone would hit the ground. I can also feel the case flex and creak inward on those two corners, and when I pull the phone out of my pocket, the levering makes the top side of the case pull away.Online reviews show a tighter fit. My copy may be an aberration. Still, I'm trading it out for Spigen's Ultra Fit with the high-grip finish. For the most common drop scenarios, I doubt this case offers much more protection than a standard polycarbonate shell.",3.0,1373414400,"07 10, 2013","Galaxy S4 Case, Spigen Slim Armor Case for Galaxy S4 - Retail Packaging - Dodger Blue (SGP10205)",19.26,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41uBkgej0nL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2656},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"
B00BW6GH76,A260N8I0FUH2ED,Dameon White,"[23, 33]","I compared this case against the Incipio DualPro and Spigen Neo Hybrid and after using all 3 I'd say I have a tie between this one and the Incipio DualPro, with the Neo Hybrid falling dead last. What I like about this case is that it looks pretty good and has a firm feel. The material is nice (slightly heavier than the Incipio which you may or may not like depending on the user) and the two-tone finish is attractive. The Dodger Blue color is pretty true to life in terms of how it looks in pictures and in person and is pleasing. This case also has slightly more grip than the Incipio; not much, but it's noticeable. Lastly, I like that the lip of the case around the screen is minimal. While this isn't ideal for protection reasons, it's large enough that you can place the phone face down on a flat surface and it won't hit the screen, but namely I like it because if you have gesture based apps as I do that require swipes from the right or left side of the bezel then this case makes touching that area easier. Plus, it's just nice to look at.Really, where I felt I was let down by this case is just in the overly shiny material. It's a fingerprint magnet the second you touch it and I'm not one who wants to have to clean my case. There really would be no point in cleaning the case anyway because once you touch it, you'll see your fingerprints whether dirty or clean. Incipio's soft touch is really the best choice here, as it'll age a lot better and over the time I've had it looked new the entire time. The Spigen on the other hand just looks terrible when light hits in and you see the smudges and fingerprints everywhere. Plus, because it's a hard, shiny case it'll definitely scratch easier, whereas the Incipio will take abuse a bit better (which I can confirm since I also had the same Incipio case for my last phone for over a year and it still looks new).Overall, though, I felt that this Spigen and the DualPro are arguably the best cases you could buy for the S4 in terms of offering great style and midrange protection. Neither is perfect, though. Go with the Spigen if you prefer shiny material, slightly more grip and virtually no lip around the screen and you don't mind some marginal added weight. Go with Incipio's DualPro if you want a little more protection, a slightly lighter case, and soft touch material. Both are winners in terms of looks if you ask me and you can't go wrong with either in that department. If you want to know which case I'm now using, I stuck with the Incipio.",3.0,1369872000,"05 30, 2013","Galaxy S4 Case, Spigen Slim Armor Case for Galaxy S4 - Retail Packaging - Dodger Blue (SGP10205)",19.26,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41uBkgej0nL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2656},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

It does look good and generally fits well.But I think it is probably lacking protection-wise - I dropped my phone with this case on, and my Glas.tr screen protector ended up chipped and cracked in one corner. This is clearly a problem with the Slim Armor case, because I subsequently dropped my phone with three other cases on, and I have not gotten new cracks or shatters in my glass screen protector. And those cases cost about half the price of this case too. So yes, I'm disappointed that this didn't protect my phone as well as it looked like it would, despite the price.You might want to check out these other cases if you're looking to ensure that your phone is protected:+ Poetic Atmosphere Case: Slim, fits your phone snugly and protects it well.

B00BW6GH76,A1EAUJAQ1HIER2,Eric Stearns,"[0, 0]","I don't like cases that much...but in my first month using the Galaxy S4 without a case, I felt like I was often on the verge of dropping it since it's so smooth, thin, and light.  My previous phone was an Evo 3D, which I used for 2 years without a case; but, it was thicker and had a textured back which made it feel much more secure in my hand.So, I decided to get a case...I wanted some drop protection, but not some giant case that made it hard to put the phone in my pocket.  This is a great compromise.  It seems to provide a fair amount of protection without adding much bulk.As others have observed, the case limits the size of the headset jack and USB connector you can use.  The audio jack needs a ""slim"" connector...I ended up buying these two connectors (I included the term ""slim"" in my search to help find these), which work fine:B004G3ZTU8B008DWGLA0The Samsung earbuds work fine.  Most of my micro-USB connectors work.  I don't know how standardized they are, but my collection of micro USB cables seem to come in small (like the one Samsung provides), medium, and large.  The small and medium work fine; the large ones don't fit.If you want a slim case, I don't think there's any way to allow the larger audio and USB connectors to work, unless the case was in two sections that allowed the connector space to be open (which would cause other problems).Overall, this is a nice case...it fits the phone well, and I think would protect it in most circumstances.

The fault this time is the molding around the volume button.  Normal wear and tear caused it to break off.  At the same time, the ""rubber"" has become more malleable and soft and has started to tear.  The natural action of putting it in your pants pocket over time has cased the entire rubber to flex easily and cause the entire case to pop off the phone.  Nearly every time I put the phone in my pocket, the case pops off even with the simplest action of sitting down.Sorry Spigen, 1st time, shame on you.  2nd time, shame on me.  Never again will I buy/recommend Spigen cases.  Not worth their price if they break on you within months.[[ ORIGINAL REVIEW - 10/13/2013 ]]Coming from aSpigen SGP SGP10215 Neo Hybrid Case for Samsung Galaxy S4 - Retail Packaging - Metal Slatecase, I decided to give Spigen one last try with this one. Originally when I bought my Galaxy S4, I initially wanted this case but changed to the Neo Hybrid at the last minute. Since the Slim Armor is actually cheaper, I wish I would have gotten this one instead.You see, the problem with the Neo Hybrid is that the outer frame is fragile. The area USB port is just held together by to small 1 centimeter pieces of plastic. These can and will break over time, basically rendering your case worthless. Why do you think that Spigen sells these frames as a standalone accessory?? It's not to give you the option of changing the appearance, it's to make you blow more money on the frames because THEY BREAK!Secondly, the area around the USB port is too small and therefore requiring you to cut the molding around your USB cables if you have standard computer-style USB cables (which are the majority of what I have).This case seems a LOT better than the Neo Hybrid. The rubber molding is snug and fits around the Galaxy S4 super tight.  The openings to all the ports are big enough to where your USB cables/headphones don't need any kind of modifications like that of the Neo Hybrid. The volume and power buttons are nice and defined (unlike the Neo Hybrid).My *only* complaint thus far is that the case itself is slick... SUPER slick. Unlike that of the Neo Hybrid where the majority of the surface was the rubber, you don't have as much of a grip as this one.

I also like that the case material is slippery enough so that it slides in and out of my jeans pocket easily, but is still easy to grip.Finally, and most importantly, not only am I dropping my phone less often with this case, but it has protected my phone perfectly when I have dropped it.  I've never owned one of those enormous armored cases, but I feel confident that this case provides excellent protection to my phone without looking or feeling like I've placed it inside a tank.One note to be aware of - the charging cable that comes with the S4 fits quite well into the micro usb port through the case, but I purchased an amazon basics charging cable that I have to jiggle to get through the case to the charging port.

B00BW6GH76,A3JL3YQYI7OR5O,Jason Chamberlain,"[0, 0]","I had used an Otterbox Defender before this case. I was tired of the bulk of the Otterbox, plus I wanted a case I could remove more easily. I also wanted something more attractive. I didn't like any of the non-black options available for the Otterbox, so I went with this in red.I really like how this case looks. As others have noted, it fits around the front, but just enough so that you can put the phone face-down. I feel like it is on securely even though the overlap is barely 1/8&#34;. I feel pretty secure about dropping my phone in this case too. I don't feel quite as secure as I did with the double-layered Otterbox Defender, but I still feel like the phone is protected.This is good because for the first 2 weeks I constantly felt like I was about to drop my phone. The S4 is a big device and I don't have particularly large hands, so this creates a problem for me. I liked being able to slide my hand up the back of the Otterbox and feel the friction as it rested on my fingers. This case feels like it is going to jump out of my hand, so I've had to change my habits a little bit. The shiny coating on the back looks great, but it is definitely slippery.Nevertheless, I like how this case provides slim protection for my phone and I am willing to deal with the slick back. The front is not as slippery, so I put the phone face-down in the passenger seat while I drive. This keeps it from sliding around every time I turn.One other small complaint is that I really have to push hard to get the power button to work. I noticed that there is just an indentation where the power button goes, but the volume buttons seem to have a little extra rubber to push on them. This is a very minor complaint compared to the lack of friction.

B00BW6GH76,A2WUMMYYGEG1HL,Jesse H,"[0, 0]","i'm really enjoying my new case from Spigen.  I've owned &#34;kick-stand&#34; cases for all my Galaxy phones thus far, but was sick of the bulkiness, the poor quality build (on what seemed to be every case I got) of the kick stand(s), and (most recently) the inability to easily remove the phone from my jean pockets (because of the rubberization).  So I decided to &#34;un-frustrate&#34; my life and get a simple case.  Came across the Spigen through a 3rd Party review site, and besides the Ottorbox cases, had some of the best reviews out there.  So after seeing how sexy my phone would look in one of these bad boys, I picked one up.The case is very sleek... almost as if they wanted to maintain the original design of the phones outer body even with the case on.  The back is a very smooth hard plastic, but IS bendable to be able to put the case on the phone.  The corners are rubberized, and have saved my phone a number of times thus far. It's a very sturdy case overall, if you're looking to protect from your everyday drops and bangs. Don't recommend any extreme testing of this case, but for the average phone user this thing gets the job done.  The case DOES have a slight raised lip around the screen to protect from face-down drops, but it's not very substantial (which is one of my issues with the case).  It does indeed do the job, as I found out the hard way, but if it were anything but a lower-velocity direct-downward drop, I'm not extremely confident that the lip would do the job.  Another issue I have with the case is the way this lip snaps onto the phone. With an S4, to make sure the case is on properly, you should NOT be able to see ANY of the metal ring that's around the phone's screen edge.  Sometimes, when putting the case on, the case's lip gets caught under this metal edge and does not  completely secure the case onto the phone.  It's solver with a little picking with your fingernail, but its a bit annoying.Besides those two very minor issues, I really love the case and recommend it to anyone looking for a good looking and overall sturdily built case.",4.0,1398643200,"04 28, 2014","Galaxy S4 Case, Spigen Slim Armor Case for Galaxy S4 - Retail Packaging - Dodger Blue (SGP10205)",19.26,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41uBkgej0nL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2656},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

This case does NOT abstruct the camera lens on the Galaxy S4 my photos are perfect!Its designed beautifully and is very slim but still it offers strong protection. It is the only case I trust to my new samsung galaxy s4.  Smartphones are an investment and need to be protected accordingly. This slim armor case by spigen offers double protection by offering two layers of protection . first layer is a rubber that goes around the whole device including bumpers of the phone and this helps absorb shock.second layer is a beautiful  plastic that gives the case strength. The plastic is cut leaving the rubber bumpers exposed so if the device is dropped it will land on the thick rubber and absorb the shock of impact. If your spending 600 dollars on a smartphone dont trust your device to just any case. This case really offers everything. Its sleek slim design will not give extra bulk yet its strong and perfectly made to absorb impacts if you drop your device. I did drop my new device on cement and it simply bounced off the thick rubber bumper absorbing the impact to my device and my device was just fine and it hit hard on the corner . thanks to my slim armor by spigen I was fully protected. This is not your regular phone case. It was designed to fully protect your device. It looks wonderful and does not give extra bulk. I love this product so much I bought one for my husbands device. He also loves the slim armor case.its the only case he chooses to use now too. Im very impressed with this product and HIGHLY recommend the slim armor. This case will not disappoint!  It feels great in the hand and looks beautiful yet it offers full protection for your device. This is a must have product! Simply awesome! Slim armor by spigen is all I trust my device to .

I had thought about getting the folio case, but had read reviews that complained about the front cover being in the way when you want to use the camera. And I thought, why would I need to cover this screen? It's made of Gorilla Glass 3, super tough stuff. The folio case doesn't protect your phone from drops, so what's so great about it? How about the Otterbox? It's similar to this case but more rugged, and better built to withstand impact. It also has those wonderful port covers built in to keep out dust. Well, I have the Otterbox and, while it's all those things, it's also heavy and bulky. Remember the first line in this review? Thin ... lightweight ... beautiful? These are all things the Otterbox is not. Enter the Slim Armor. Barely larger than the phone, this case is ideal. It's lightweight and as elegant as the phone itself. The front edges extend just beyond the edges of the phone, adding just enough lift to keep your screen from touching a table top. This also makes it easier to swipe side to side without your finger stopping against the case's edge (which happens with the Otterbox). On the back, your camera lens is thankfully recessed so it's protected when you lay the phone on its back. The two-piece design fits together beautifully. The case is easy to slip on or off the phone, should you need to. I've had three other cases for this phone. When you have the best of the best phones, you want the case to be best of the best, too.

A little pricey at $50, but I gave it a shot, and I'm pretty impressed.The case fits nicely with both cameras and the rear flash, no issues with those. However, the rear camera is slightly obstructed when you fold the front cover all the way back, which is sorta inconvenient. But it wouldn't look great to take a picture through the viewing window anyways!Speaking of the viewing window, it is see-through plastic. The product description wasn't very clear about this part. Not only is it see through plastic so the phone isn't exposed there, but they also provide a screen protector for this part of the case! With that little screen protector, and a full one I bought for the whole phone screen, I'm still able to answer calls through that window like you're supposed to (although it might be a little less responsive with all the screen protectors, it works).The front cover has a nice cover thing for the home button on the front, that both protects the button and responds nicely to presses. The side buttons are also protected, but they are a little less responsive than I'd hope since the black hard plastic around them is pretty hard (good for protection though).The front cover *sorta* clicks into its place when closed, enough that it doesnt fall out of its position but not enough that it's very hard to open. I wish it also stayed in it's fully open position in the same way, but unfortunately it doesnt.The folding cover does lay flat on the back side as promised, and it's pretty good. It gets a bit annoying when texting though, since you're holding it closed with one hand.Protection wise, it does the job!EDIT: I forgot to mention, the case covers the LED on the front of the phone that your notifications would cause to flash.

It looks super sleek and it is just an all round great case.There are one downside that I have noticed with both cases and one with the black one:1. There is next to no lip so if you drop your phone face down, there is a good chance you might crack your screen. That said, you can place it face down and the screen won't touch the surface it is on. Any other type of drop should be covered by the case. 2. The downside to the black case is how noticeable the fingerprints are (due to the glossy finish). I try not to let it bother me (I am a little OCD about my things being clean) and it isn't that bad if you don't notice that sort of thing.Also, only buy this case from Spigen. Do not try to get it cheaper elsewhere because odds are you will get a counterfeit. I ordered from another seller and sure enough, my case was not authentic.

The feel of the case is ergonomically correct.The rubber part of the case is very hard but still spongy enough to absorb shock. The rubber is so flawlessly cut, I have OCD and the way everything is cut and lined up absolutely perfectly makes it that much better.The case covers just enough of the front of the phone to raise it up to lay face down without the screen touching. However, if the phone falls face down, it offers very little protection.I do like the fact that the very sides of the phone case show the color of the case when looking at the screen. The case really is slim and barely adds any extra bulk to the phone in hand. The case is two pieces which is cool because u can buy the different color backs to change it up.Given the price this was listed for, I thought for sure this was going to be a fake. Sure enough, it came with a verification number and it is a genuine Spigen case. It came in the Spigen hard case with the 3 jelly buttons and the product brochure.The 3 jelly button colors are black, orange, and white. The purpose of these are to help the Home button be readily accessible due to the case creating a mm raise above the phones original Home button.I use a the black jelly button because I have the S4 black mist, and it is cut out perfect as well. I can still see the chrome trim on all sides of the jelly button evenly.The jelly button has a mild stickiness on the back of it. I've removed  this button several times just to see if it left a residue, which it did not, and I noticed the jelly button didnt seem to lose any stickiness and remains in place fine.I should also note that I use a micro cloth (not included unfortunately) very frequently (ocd kickin in) to wipe the smudges from the screen clean without regard for the jelly button and it stays right in place every time. Never has come off in my pocket or cleaning or any other way without me purposely taking it off. (I was surprised)if I have to say one thing I dont like about the case, its that the volume rocker and power button are protected with the hard rubber which makes the feedback hard to feel.

This case also keeps my screen from being scratched because of the edge being a tiny bit higher than the screen. With this case on I can use the charging cable that came with the phone with no problems and also I can use the headphone jack. All the cut outs are exactly in the right spot.

B00BW6GH76,A1V57T3WM4L88K,S. Stephenson,"[1, 2]","If you want a slim and beautiful, yet protective case for your Galaxy S4, this is the case for you.  I'm very picky about the case I want on my phone and read hundreds of reviews on various covers from Spigen, Otterbox, and Incipio.  I first bought an Elago plastic cover because it looked good (an eye-popping red) and was cheap (less that $10).  However, I wanted a more protective case during my daily train commute to work, where a careless bump from another commuter is all it takes to drop my phone.PROS1.  Aesthetics - I got the white Slim Armor to go with my white Galaxy S4.  Simply put, it looks stunning.  The black on the case accentuates the look of the phone overall.  It is thin and seems to add &#34;muscle&#34; to the phone's looks instead of &#34;fat&#34;.  I'm considering getting the case in blue as well.2.  Function - I was worried about some of the review stating certain headphones and microUSB cables won't fit.  Thankfully, I did not run into that issue.  I have the Beats By Dre Tour earbuds (which has a flat &#34;head&#34; instead of a pointy one like the OEM earphones) and if they did not work with the case, I would have had to regretfully return the case.  I also use the OEM charger, connected to this dock:Patuoxu Dual Desktop Chargerhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CMNJ6LM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_hst_1Even with the case on, it still fits in the dock (you just need to remove the inner adapter on the dock).  Absolutely fantastic design.  Not sure if it will fit other docks but I'm happy it fits on mine.  Also, I've read some reviews about the buttons not functioning properly.  I have not run into that issue; both the volume rocker and power buttons respond quite well when pressed.3.  Protection - The Galaxy S4 is a feather light phone, and for some people (myself included) it might be a bit too light.  The Slim Armor adds just enough weight to make it feel perfect in my hand.  The top and bottom of the case are rubberized, providing some shock protection.  The TPU &#34;liner&#34; I hazard to guess (I haven't dropped my phone with the case on yet) should provide more protection from drops than a simple plastic case.CONS1.  Lip - As others have pointed out, the &#34;lip&#34; on the front screen is minimal, virtually not existent.  I personally don't mind this (a thick &#34;lip&#34; would seem to make the screen more difficult to use) but it might be an issue for others.  I had a Belkin cover on my iPhone 4S and the lip was at least three times bigger, if not more.  I would have preferred the lip on the Spigen case to be a little bigger (1 or 2 mm) but its better that they erred on the side of too little rather than too much.2.  Fingerprints - It has a glossy finish, which makes it a fingerprint magnet.  I have to wipe my phone multiple times a day with a micro fiber cloth because of the screen, so it isn't that much of a hassle to have to swipe the case clean as well.3.  Price - As good as this case is, I think the pricing is a bit steep.  I'd like to see it go for $20 but even if it is at the higher end of my price expectation, it's still well worth it.  FYI, I know at the time I purchased it that there was a sale from another company (with Amazon as the distributor) but I saw some bad reviews and didn't want to worry about a fake.Overall, this case is fantastic.  It's not the thinnest case, nor the most protective but rather a perfect hybrid.",5.0,1371686400,"06 20, 2013","Galaxy S4 Case, Spigen Slim Armor Case for Galaxy S4 - Retail Packaging - Dodger Blue (SGP10205)",19.26,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41uBkgej0nL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2656},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B00BW6GH76,AGMPY4VHSMWA9,The Wiz,"[0, 0]","...and this Slim Armor case cushioned it like a baby. And thank goodness, I paid $600 out the pocket for this phone. When I say I researched the hell out of smart phone cases (namely OtterBox and Spigen), I'm not joking. I'm a girly girl type of woman, but I'm not at all big on colorful, bulky cases. I love the thin, sleek design of my S4 so I wanted a case that would protect my investment, yet would be slim enough to conform to the original design of my phone. I love the toughness of the OtterBox products, but they are way too bulky for my taste; the thought of holding a brick to my ear was not appealing at all. The Spigen Slim Armor seemed the most obvious choice. It comes in different, rather bright colors, but naturally, I chose the unassuming black color. The edges of the case are rubberized to protect it from bumps and drops and it absorbs shocks from those bumps and drops. It comes with dual protection because it has a rubberized inner case; the outer case (the part that comes in various colors) is a hard plastic (polycarbonate shell).I would say the only downside is that the lip ( and various edges) of the case juuuust covers the edge of the phone. I wish it covered a little more, but I guess that's where a screen protector comes in to play.This is an excellent product. Read the reviews...well over 1,000 of them and almost 5 stars.

The only complaint I have is that although it's not as slippery as just holding the bare phone without any case, it's still more slippery than I expected from this kind of good material and workmanship. Be careful because your phone can still slip out of your hand.  Also, I wish it had a kickstand.  Other than that, the design is really professional.  1 dropped star due to slight slipperiness.UPDATED:I have the following cases:1) Spigen Galaxy S4 Slim Armor2) Beyond Cell Tri-Shield Hybrid Hard Shell/Silicone Case with kickstand3) OMIU(TM) Protective Frost TPU Skin Case Cover with Kickstand for Samsung Galaxy S4Pros and Cons as below.1) Spigen Galaxy S4 Slim ArmorPROS:-Not as slippery as the other two.  When I first got this (because I got this one first before receiving the others), I thought it was a little slippery.  But after trying the other two, I have NO COMPLAINTS about slipperiness!!  Dropping to 1 star due to lack of kickstand.-Smaller form than the Beyond Cell one, but slightly larger than the OMIU one.-Extremely good materials.  Feels like it's expensive material.CONS:-No kickstand (I sent the manufacturer an email about it.... let's see if they introduce a kickstand or not).-Because it isn't rubber or silicone, fear tells me it may not protect the phone as well as the Beyond Cell one.  But, I haven't done any drop testings yet.  And, I have insurance through Verizon so I can replace the phone for $100 if I break it by accident so this is a moot point.2) Beyond Cell Tri-Shield Hybrid Hard Shell/Silicone Case with kickstandPROS:-Has a decent kickstand.-Thick and feels like it might protect the phone if dropped.CONS:-Feels slippery.  As a test side by side with the Spigen, the Beyond Cell one slipped out of my hands.-Bulky and larger-Hard to take this thing off the phone.  I had to undo pretty much all the connections.3) OMIU(TM) Protective Frost TPU Skin Case Cover with Kickstand for Samsung Galaxy S4PROS:-Has a kickstand (but a very cheap kickstand that won't last very long in my opinion)-Small form, even smaller than the Spigen.CONS:-Materials seem really cheap.-Slippery than the Spigen.  This one also fell out of my hands before the Spigen one did.-Hard for me to plug the USB charger cord in.  This thing blocks it slightly so I have to push the cord slightly harder in.

B00BYJXGP2,A300U9M6DPRP1O,AkShiz,"[0, 0]","Ingenuity means: The quality of being clever, original, and inventive. Some of the issues that others have complained about are true, the charge port cut-out will only accept the genuine Samsung USB plug. That's fine for me because it makes the case look that more stream lined anyways, and makes the case hidden in plain sight since most who see it think the case is the phone only. Plus OEM USB cords are a dime a dozen on here and eBay. As far as the issue of the bumper coming off and getting loose after awhile, that is where it took some cleverness to fix it. I just used some plain ole plumbers glue. You can get it at pretty much any hardware store. You have to use a thin, kinda firm, plastic bristle brush like the kind for art painting, and be careful not to put it on too thick or too close to the openings- yet as much as you can cover the outside of the insert with. Just be careful not to let it get on the outside of the bumper or back of the case. Take your time. The plumbers glue I used is called ""Weld On"" 773-ABS is the item number, but I suspect any PGlue made for plastic pipe welding will do the trick. It does exactly as the name implies in about 7-12 minutes, It ""welds"" the bumper to the case making it one solid case that still goes on easily. Other glues crack off or separate like super glue for instance, but since this dries like hard bonding plastic and is used to seal plastic water drain pipes making them water proof, it fits the bill on the bonding side perfectly. Pros: Bumper trim no longer gets loose and is less prone to come off in your pockets. Cons: you can't switch out the bumper if you have several colored ones and want to switch it up. So each colored bumper has to have its own insert. Moot point if you only have one of course. I really like this case because it makes my S4 look really classy and doesn't make it look cheap like some cases can, and is perfect for light protection. It doesn't really add any bulk to the phone, and it feels great in your hand. Personally I think the case should have been one piece anyways, thank goodness for plumbers glue!",5.0,1377648000,"08 28, 2013","Galaxy S4 Case, Spigen Neo Hybrid Series for Galaxy S4 - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate (SGP10215)",19.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oxLk3RfUL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1892},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B00BYJXGP2,AI32AO3TTCTY7,Art the Science Guy,"[0, 0]","The Spiegen Neo Hybrid case is sleek, beautiful and fits the Samsung Galaxy S4 perfectly giving it the look of the iPhone. It has however, two significant flaws that may persuade some to buy a different case entirely. The first major drawback is the size of the cutouts for headphone and mini USB connection to charge the phone. The second major drawback is the fact that the case is so flat, when you lie the phone down on any surface, screen up, the speaker is almost totally covered rendering the ring tone almost inaudible. There are various work-arounds that users such as myself have adopted to cope with these short comings which I will elucidate in this review.First, I never place the phone on a flat surface because when I do, I can't hear the phone ring. Spigen could ""fix"" this problem by adding two small ""bumps"" on the rear of the case which would elevate the speaker about a millimeter off of hard surfaces allowing the audio from the phone to be better heard. I have made a habit of putting the phone down so that part of it is elevated allowing the audio from the speaker to be heard. Imagine how it would sound if you placed your thumb squarely over the small speaker on the back of any phone . . . try it and see if you can hear it ring - now you know how it will sound when you put in in a Spigen case on a flat surface.The other problem - which is major, the cutouts being too small limiting usage of headphones and chargers has several work-arounds which I will share.The cutouts for both headphone and Mini USB are just a tad too small to accommodate most chargers and headphones. The home charger that comes with the phone fits great however, it has been a struggle to find a car charger that fits AND charges as fast and efficiently as the home charger. Even theSamsung  Standard Car Power Charger [CAD300UBEB/STD] OEM Samsung car charger didn't fit the cut-out and with only 750mA output, is just too weak when compared to the 2A (2000mA) output of the home charger.Some have suggested enlarging the holes in the Spigen case using a file or a drill however, this is the wrong path to take, in my opinion. The band which surrounds the Spigen case which comes in many colors from red and white to silver metallic is gray plastic which is painted, so if you file it or drill it, you will expose the ugly gray plastic just under the paint (see my customer pictures). Another negative consequence of modifying the cut-outs is the possibility of weakening the structural integrity of the case. If you make the holes larger you can weaken the case by making it more likely to crack when dropped right where you enlarged the holes. The better solution is to reduce the size of the plugs you intend to insert into the phone to either charge it or plug in headphones. I have tried many chargers and extension cables that would do just that and have discovered a few that will work with the Spigen case after modification. First off, I searched for a car charger that I could use to charge my Galaxy S4 that had sufficient output to charge it while it was being used in the car and could be plugged into my phone while in the aforementioned Spigen Neo Hybrid case. The answer I discovered is the Anker 2-Port Car Charger with Mini USB cordAnker 18W / 3.6A (2.1A + 1.5A) Car Charger with Built-in Micro USB Cord for Android - The First and Smallest Adapter to Deliver Simultaneous, Full-Speed Charges to iPads and Smartphoneswhich can be easily modified to fit into the Spigen case. If you follow this link and go to my review of the product, I have posted the instructions and several pictures showing how this can be done. The next problem was finding a short extension cable that had a plug small enough to insert into the headphone cutout which would allow me to use any headphone or speaker without difficulty. I bought six products that supposedly had very narrow plugs and unfortunately, every product I purchased had a plug that was just too large to be able to fit into the cutout available in the Spigen case. The headphones that come with the Samsung phone do fit however most others will not. I did discover however that there were two products that I could grind down using a Dremel Tool and/or cut down using an X-Acto knife  that would allow me to customize the plug so that it would easily fit. the two are:Your Cable Store 1 Foot 3.5mm Stereo Headphone Extension CableandStereo Audio Headphone Extension Cable 3.5mm 6in inch.I used a Dremel tool with the grinding wheel attachment at low speed so as not to melt the plastic, to decrease the size of the front portion of one of the plugs and an Exacto knife on the other so that it would fit inside the headphone cut-out of the Spigen case. After grinding/cutting it down to size, I used a coat of JB Weld epoxyB Weld 8265S Weld Compound - Epoxy Twin Packto smooth it out and add some additional strength to the plug and then used flat black paint so it matched the rest of the plug. I shall post some pictures above so you can see how the finished product looks both in and out of the case. With these modifications, I can use any headphone and the Anker 2-Port Car charger with modified plug works great when I need to recharge the phone in the car.Some people have said that they had no problem with the size of the cut-outs but I have trouble believing that unless they only used the stock headphones and the home charger. I purchased six car chargers including the OEM Samsung unit, all with smallish plugs and none of them fit into the micro USB cut-out of the Spigen case. Then finding a charger that actually charged the 2600mAH battery of the Galaxy S4 is yet another story. I loved the case so much that I went out of my way to make it work, I hope my suggestions are helpful to others.",4.0,1373155200,"07 7, 2013","Galaxy S4 Case, Spigen Neo Hybrid Series for Galaxy S4 - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate (SGP10215)",19.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oxLk3RfUL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1892},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

As another reviewer has mentioned previously, the slot for the micro usb port doesn't allow all chargers to fit.

What?There is no paint on these cases for it to come off in the first place!!  I think they reviewed the wrong product, i'm glad I didn't listen to them.[July 28, 2013] Update!!!  So, about a couple of weeks ago I began noticing that paint IS coming off the plastic shell.  I was wrong; I didn't know this actually has a layer of paint on it as someone commented earlier.  Luckily my white doesn't look too bad mainly because I have the white case (white paint over white plastic).  Also the thin piece of plastic (where you'd put the USB cable) is now broken.  With such a fragile outer plastic shell I can't imagine why this case doesn't come with an extra plastic shell, or at least the option to purchase them--after all it's a great idea that could add the diversity of color selection. I'm thinking of just gluing the darn plastic shell to the rubber casing--heck, why not.  I still love this case; but, after 3 months I can't say this is a top notch quality product.  I'm down grading to a generous 4 stars.[Update July 28, 2013]: I just notice now we have the option to purchase the shells.  They're priced at ~ $11; at this late in the game and due to the inevitable paint chipping and thin plastic piece breaking this price is just too high.  It should be for $3 to $5, more people would then buy multiple shells and Spigen would get more sales while restoring their reputation.",4.0,1368748800,"05 17, 2013","Galaxy S4 Case, Spigen Neo Hybrid Series for Galaxy S4 - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate (SGP10215)",19.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oxLk3RfUL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1892},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

This case, unfortunately, falls way short of my expectations.The biggest problem is that you can't plug anything into your phone with this case, except the original Samsung micro USB cable and the smallest of headphones.  I don't know about everyone else, but I've been acquiring micro USB chargers for years and they're scattered throughout my house/car/office.  Not being able to use any of them with my S4 while wearing this case is extremely frustrating.  It means I have to carry around my Samsung OEM cable with me everywhere I go.As for the headphones, I use either Shure SE315's or Sennheiser HD280's and with this case, the plug won't fully seat into the phone so I can't get any audio.

Instead, it's all very flimsy and essentially feels like you're wrapping a large rubberband around the case. The painted aluminum finish part is very cheap feeling and the back is as well since it's like a wind sale type of material that can flop around a little and seems like it'll loosen over time. The overall design isn't too bad and former iPhone fans (or those that like the look of an iPhone in general) will probably like that this makes your phone when placed face down look like a large iPhone. Unfortunately, the shape of the casing and cheap material make for a case that feels awkward to hold in my hands and the way the case wraps around the front at a weird angle gives the front a mismanaged appearance from the rest of the case. Also, as I expected, it doesn't offer any real protection aside from scratches and small bumps.

Approximately 5 months later, this case is broken.While the case looks good and very polished, the outer ""frame"" is the piece at fault.  To keep the case in 1 solid piece, the weak spot is the area around the USB port.  The ""frame"" is held together by 2 tiny threads of plastic.  Well this past weekend, 1 piece of that tiny thread of plastic broke off.  Not thinking it was a big deal, 3 days later, the other one broke off.  Now the frame is unusable and I just have the ""rubber jacket"" surrounding my phone.  It's important to note that I have NEVER dropped my Galaxy S4 thus far and it only fits in my pants or jacket pocket.  I've never abused this case.Why do you think that Spigen sells these frames as a standalone accessory?? It's not to give you the option of changing the appearance, it's to make you blow more money on the frames because THEY BREAK!Also to note, since I'm reviewing this case is that as other reviewers have mentioned, the main issue with the case is the area around the USB port.  The plastic frame is too narrow for standard computer USB cables.  The only way to make them fit is to use a knife and shave the cable itself to where it is small enough to fit in the USB port.  I have performed this mod on probably about 8 or 9 USB cables I use around my house, work and car.As I said previously, the case *looks* good but it's not sturdy at all and now I am in the process of looking for another case on Amazon.

With the GS4, however, I didn't feel like I needed a case since the phone is all plastic and all of the parts on it are relatively cheap to replace. My main problem with the GS4 was the cheap, slippery feel of the back cover. I wanted a case that would keep my phone thin while improving the general look and feel. This case does just that. The materials used are all premium. The colored bumper is slightly slippery but that is not an issue for me. My biggest concern was the back TPU part of the case. I'm used TPU cases before that have been very grippy. So grippy that they attract all of the dust and lint in my pocket. Luckily, this is not the case with this case (no pun intended). The back has a nice, soft touch feel to it. The cutouts on this case are absolutely perfect. Everything matches up like it should. The headphone cutout is rather small and is designed for straight plugs. I have an L-shaped plug that didn't fit. I ended up trimming some of the plastic off of the plug (not the case!) and viola, it fits perfectly. Those audio plugs have too much plastic on them anyway.

I've dropped my phone from 5 feet onto concrete multiple times and managed to chip/dent it a little, but nothing problematic.Other than improving the feel of the phone, the buttons are AWESOME. They make it SO MUCH easier to press power and volume. If you've used a GS4 without a case, you probably know what I mean, especially if you have big hands like me.

Overall, what I got was a disappointment.In the pictures, the outer edge of the case looks like it's metal.  Metal would be a great idea for the edge of a case because it can absorb and redistribute shock while preventing the phone from twisting or deforming in a way that would cause the glass to break.  I was a bit disappointed to find that it's just plastic.Instead of being a single piece of flawless plastic, the outer edge is made of 4 pieces of plastic that are joined together in such a way that the seams are visible.On the back of the case, the rubber bulges up around the camera and LED.  The rubber is thick enough that this is not done to protect the camera, but rather that the shape of the phone was not taken into consideration when designed.  All the other cases I have, from expensive to cheap, account for the contours and don't bulge out in the back!The power and volume buttons, however, are crisp and feel great to press - I wish the phone's buttons were built like this from the factory.

It even protects the edges, and has a little lip so it doesn't touch the table or any flat surface when it's face down. It's top notch and great quality that I think it will last for a long time. There are even silver buttons that cover your phone's buttons so no part of your phone is exposed except the cut-out openings for the earphones, the charger slot, microphone hole on the top and button, the S beam, camera, and speaker. I haven't used any third party charger, but I will say that I tried using a pair of Sony earphones with the L shape plug and they worked fine. I know some of the complaints were that third party accessories didn't worked because of the sharp cut-outs, but I haven't tried any.

Solid, perfect fit, fantastic style that looks like part of your phone rather than something you've installed, keeps phone nice and thin while providing full protection front and back, and I also love Spigen as a company.  All of my mini USB cables fit just fine in the USB cutout, the OEM Samsung one as well as many other brands.But it is true, the headphone jack is far too small for probably 95% of the headphones you have.  This is very unfortunate.  And although all of the videos and writeups regarding this case mention the ""interchangeable case surrounding"", what no one tells you is thats only hypothetically true as Spigen doest sell them separately anywhere.  So what good is the ability to change the outer color if you cant buy other colors to replace them with?  You can only get alternate colors by ordering an entire second case.  They may have as well just sealed and adhered the outside bezel to the inner black, soft case.The overall quality, solidity, fit, almost OEM like appearance and lack of bulk are so perfect though, I find it impossible to give the case less than 4 stars, just be aware that there are a few design flaws on an otherwise beautiful item.  Since I got my GS4, Ive been through about 4 cases so far.  This one is a keeper.

I have just ordered it and will update my review to let everybody know if that works or not.Besides the issue with the headphone jack, this case is awesome. The packaging and instructions give the feeling of a high quality product, as does the case itself. All Galaxy S4 features are usable with the case, including the power button, volume rocker, min-USB charger and all the sensors that need access.UPDATE 7/19/2013----------------I received the Cellet Slim 3.5mm adapter and it fits into the Neo Hybrid headphone hole so any headphones can be used.While I was waiting for the adapter, I saw on sale (for only $3) and ordered the Duzign Mirage Snap On case for the Galaxy S4.

B00BYJXGP2,AU6YHEJY8QZRE,"N. Hill ""rawrrbot""","[0, 0]","I bought this case for my Samsung GS4 and I've had it for about two months now. I like the way it looks, it adds very little bulk to the device, and it is comfortable to hold. I have Infinity White and, so far, the frame seems resistant to staining, so it still looks very clean. I am moderately careful with my device, but I have dropped it a few times from short heights, and it has not sustained any damage. I will say that the frame seems to have weakened as a result of a fall from the bed onto carpet. While the case still looks and fits well, the frame seems to be more elastic than when I first put it on. It feels like it would be extremely easy to snap and that another fall (even from a short height onto a soft surface) might break it. The upside is, the frame can be purchased separately (SPIGEN SGP Samsung Galaxy S4 Case Protective [Neo Hybrid Replacement Frame] [Infinity White] Bumper Replacement Frame ONLY for Galaxy S IV Galaxy SIV i9500 - Infinity White) and it comes in different colors, so it serves as a backup plan and a customization option. I do not plan to drop my phone much, especially on a hard surface, but after some use, I would not expect this case to protect against hard falls. If you tend to drop your phone off your bed, a couch, or chair onto carpeted areas, you should be fine with this case. However, if you often get out of the car and your device falls out of your lap onto hard ground, or you drop your phone from several feet off the ground, I wouldn't expect this to fully protect your phone.[ETA] The frame snapped at the USB cutout. I am not sure when it happened exactly, but it was not a result of a fall because, I haven't dropped my phone at all since my review.",4.0,1379116800,"09 14, 2013","Galaxy S4 Case, Spigen Neo Hybrid Series for Galaxy S4 - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate (SGP10215)",19.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oxLk3RfUL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1892},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B00BYJXGP2,A2EQH150G63PDS,Nicholi2789,"[0, 0]","Let me begin my review by first saying that I am somewhat of a case whore. Before when I had my S3 I had 12 cases for it before I sold it. Now with my S4 I have 6 now. I'm the kinda person that really loves my phone outside of a case, but am too scared to actually carry it around like that, so I am constantly looking for a case that offers reasonable protection but maintains the slim profile of the device. For my S4 I have an Otterbox, 2 incipio cases, a Poetic atmosphere case (highly recommend), and another cheap one. I don't like the bulk Otterboxes add, and I don't like the boring-ness that super slim cases add. I want something stylish, but also thin and protective (very tall order I know).As usual I was browsing the dark recesses of Amazon when I stumbled across this amazing company with their great customer reviews and their awesome looking cases. I found this one. Immediately the red and black contrast caught my eye. Then I read the description and was hooked.A case that keeps the device slim, but is still stylish AND has the capability to change frames to change the color and look of the case. Freaking amazing. I immediately, bought the case with the red frame included and also ordered an extra Silver frame with it.First order of business;Shipping and handling: As usual the item showed up in two days which was two days before the projected arrival date by Amazon.( I always pick USPS priority shipping, never more than three days and only 5$). It was an extremely padded box filled with bubble wrap and my new beloved case.Everything was in pristine shape and no complaints. Never had any issue with damaged items from Amazon.The Case: I must say, Spigen's marketing department really has it down. Aside from their attractive logo and colorful cases, even their packaging for their cases is attractive. The Case came in a a round clear plastic box adorned with Spigen logos. I kept the plastic box cause I thought it was cool. Usually I throw away packaging for stuff right away.The case is two pieces: First the rectangular plastic frame that wraps around the rubber inside sleeve. The frame by itself feels flimsy and easily breakable but once you put it on the phone around the rubber sleeve it feels very firm.The case is easily removable, and switching frames takes all of two seconds.Word of advice: when attaching or removing the case from your phone keep it in one piece. What I mean is; Put the frame ON the rubber sleeve the way it goes, THEN put your phone inside them both. It's much easier. Just but the top of the phone in the case first and press it down, then put the bottom in and press it down. It is much easier than puttin on the rubber sleeve first THEN adding the frame. Then you run the risk of breaking the frame (though I haven't broken one yet.)The case molds to the phone very well giving a nice tight fit.There has been some complaint about people not being able to use their headphones with this case but I haven't experienced that problem. I have several sets of Skull Candy earbuds, my Samsung OEM headphones (the best), and some Beats by Dre headphones. They all fit just fine. I could see somebody having a problem with headphones that have a ninety degree jack though.As for the charging port cutout, it also fits perfectly with the OEM charger. Some chargers by other brands do not fit though. I have an old LG charger that I use at work and it's USB plug doesn't fit, but as I have three Samsung OEM chargers it's not a problem for me.The only ONLY complaint I have about this case is that the frame is just a little too thick so I can't use it with my Samsung Smart dock that I use at home. Not really a big deal though.All the buttons on this case click really nicely and almost feel as if they are made of metal since they give such a nice defined click when you press the power or volume buttons. That was one thing I hated about Otterboxes, is how hard you have to press the buttons to get them to work. NOT a problem on this case. It feels as if your clicking the actual buttons.Also, one big reason why I insist on using cases is that I have a habit of setting my phone down alot. I don't ever set it screen down (unless it's in a case) and don't like setting it down on it's back without a case because it sits right on the camera lens. I'm afraid of scratching the lens up and not getting nice clear pictures like I do. That's something I wish Samsung would have though of is to make the lens just slightly recessed so it doesn't scratch so easily. Anyways, this case DOES give it clearance of the camera lens but a few millimeters, and when you set it face down it has plenty of clearance from the screen. Very nice.A quick word on durability and I'll wrap this up:As I stated above, my first impression of the plastic frame was that it seemed flimsy and easily breakable but it is much stronger than it looks. I have already dropped my phone is this case several times. Once of a desk onto linoleum and another time from about shoulder high onto concrete. Neither impact broke the frame. Though the drop onto concrete did make a little cluster of pinpricks on one corner. Only noticeable if your looking closely. I thought for sure a solid drop would break the frame but it isn't so! Much much stonger than it looks. And, if you DO somehow break a frame all you got to do is order a new frame for $9.99Conclusion: I must say, Spigen really nailed it with this case. ESPECIALLY for the price. $16 is incredibly cheap for this high of quality case. They could easily charge 40$ for it and I personally would have paid it. The extra frames do cost $9.99 each but they are worth it as well, especially since there are so many colors. I have nearly all the colors except white. I plan to get them all.I really hope that Spigen comes up with more case designs for the S4. They are a great company that doesn't charge an arm and a leg and stands by their product. I already ordered their other S4 casethe ""slim armor"" and it too has interchangable frames. Very nice.As I said in the title, Great company, Great Case, Great price.

I am a very careful person and never drop my phone, so I am not worried about too much drop protection.  If you are the type of person who is worried about dropping your phone from 6 feet high on concrete, go check out one of those ugly, bulky cases.  I picked this case because it is slim, adds no bulk and actually makes the Galaxy S4 look better.  It has a lay on the table design and the tpu back is thick enough that the camera and flash lens are also safe from touching flat surfaces.  I also like the fact that it adds more grip to the phone.  The Galaxy S4 without a case is very slick and slippery. I personally think that this is the best case if you're trying to protect your phone from scratches, minor drops and want better grip.  Also the silver looks sexy with the black Galaxy because it picks up on the silver accents of the home button, camera ring, speakers and samsung symbol.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I feel like they should have made the speaker cutout a little bit bigger.

For me the looks and feels matter more. In terms of appearance, Spigen Neo Hybrid ranks in the upper echelon of smart phone cases. The back is made from a high-quality plastic that almost feels like rubber. It feels great holding it in the hand. The volume rockers and the lock button work perfect; no problem whatsoever with it. Spigen has thrown in three colorful stickers for the home screen that add a phenomenal touch to the feel of the home button and the over all look.Before buying this case, there is one thing people should be aware of. The cutout for the charger/data cable and the headphone is best designed for the stock Samsung cable and headphones. Some third party cables and headphones might fit, but many will not. My Bose headphone works perfectly with this case, however.There are also some complaints regarding the bulkiness of this case. In my humble opinion, this case is not bulky at all. It offer some levels of protection without sacrificing its sexy and appealing design. If you think this case is bulky, then go check out Otterbox cases, or something similar to them.

B00BYJXGP2,A5RCLB4N34XCN,Takah,"[0, 0]","I've owned both the galaxy s2 and s3 and now I own the s4. and again every time I have to choose between a protective case I choose spigen spg neo hybrid.when I first saw the s2 neo hybrid case I immediately bought it because it had no back cover, rubber and plastic, which made my phone feel slimmer and feel more protected, it immediately became the best phone case I've had to date.Things started to go downhill when I bought the neo hybrid for my s3. It had this issue that wherever the phone was in the case it wouldn't stop turning the volume up or down and even the slightest touch on the power button key side would immediately unlock the phone. that happened because those things were too tall and made too much pressure. I had to cut down some tpu that was on top of the buttons to make it at least usable, but because of that I had to press really hard to make the buttons responsive, another problem that i had, along with the nexus 4 official case is that the super thin plastic where the USB hole is placed breaks too easily. after it breaks you're still protected but It doesn't feel nice to have the poly carbonate part loose.Today I just received my package including the neo hybrid case and a steinheil screen protector for my galaxy s4. the first thing I noticed is that the blue poly carbonate part of the case is not as shiny as the picture above shows it (apparently that's a 3D render), it is opaque and the neo hybrid logo at the side of the poly carbonate isn't as sharp and good looking as the s3's was, almost feels like the s4's poly carbonate part is a cheaply made imitation. It also has the super thin air plastic where the usb hole is, which I think will break after a month or two from grabbing my phone from my jeans pocket with two fingers. As soon as I put  the phone inside the case... did you guess?... HAPPENS THE SAME DAMN THING that happened with the s3 neo hybrid case, but in this case the thing that is over the power button is the only problem, HOWEVER it's another plastic button and not part of the tpu and therefore I can't cut it down. One workaround that I found was putting some paper in between the tpu and the poly carbonate parts just a little below where the power button is in order to hold my phone without it being unlocked by itselfI won't lie, the phone feels really protected against drops and stuff. I just hope it doesnt wear my s4's back cover as the s3's did because of dust filtering after some months (I used to clean it like once a week or so). It doesn't add much bulk and looks really classy despite the blue polycarbonate part is opaque.Jeez Spigen please design your cases better. I'll give you one more chance with the neo hybrid case when the s5 comes out. if I have the same problem AGAIN, I won't buy your cases even if yours are the prettiest out there...",2.0,1372291200,"06 27, 2013","Galaxy S4 Case, Spigen Neo Hybrid Series for Galaxy S4 - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate (SGP10215)",19.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oxLk3RfUL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1892},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B00D94RCV4,A2Y49KA0M7XKQD,Alex E.,"[0, 0]","Now I see a lot of people are complaining about shipping but you have to understand with the champagne gold being a new colorway of the iPhone it would take a while for third parties to replicate the color so production takes time. Hence why everyone got a shipping number so early and it didn't ship till the 16th. I understand why give customers a shipping number before actually shipping? It's for them to organize who's order came in first and such.But I received my case today, and the packaging was good. The case looks amazing! This case gives me my gold fix for my space grey 5s. It is a 2 piece case, a rubber or tpu casing with a gold bumper. The case fits well and slim. Doesn't add much bulk. The buttons are working and tactile. You can hear the buttons shake a bit but if that seriously bothers you, you're being way too picky. The lightning port works with the apple lightning port, and it has room for third party lightning cables. As for the headphone jack my beats pro jack fits it perfect. Large headphone jacks might have a problem.If you don't have a screen shield you will have a small lay on the table feature. If you have a regular screen shield you'll still have a BIT of a lay of the table design. I am using Spigen's Glass.tR and its flush with the case, so NO lay on the table design. Most tempered glass shields will be flush. But that doesn't bother me. For drop protection it seems like it can handle typical drops. But if you're the type of person to constantly drop your phone especially outside this might not be the case for you.Overall if you're looking for a slim yet protective case that looks amazing in Champagne Gold this is the case for you!",5.0,1382313600,"10 21, 2013","iPhone 5S Case, Spigen Neo Hybrid Series for iPhone 5/5S - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate (SGP10360)",21.26,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414hzwXyzTL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1201},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

The sound jack of my Bose Companion speakers won't fit through the case. With bluetooth speakers available now a days this shouldn't be a problem but I wouldn't buy a bluetooth speaker just due to this issue.

Only one that comes anywhere close to it is my Spigen Slim Armor case as far as durability, quality and overall design.Pro'sIts literally so slim you wont notice its on your phone.It looks classy. I've had mine for a few days and ive gotten compliments.Works with glass screen protectors. I am currently using a Tech Armor Ballistic Glass screen protector and it works just fine.The outer bumper can be swapped out with different colors. The red is pretty sweet though. Maybe ill get a white one at some point to try it out.Another huge PRO is the fact that it has built in buttons instead of just raised rubber buttons. They feel solid, not hard to press and click when you press them.Con'sThe price in my opinion is a bit steep for what it is. I have no doubt in my mind that Spigen makes these for just a few bucks. Still a darn nice case though.I bought this on amazon and was shipped directly from Spigen. Took almost 3 weeks to arrive. Yes I said 3 weeks. What the heck is that about? I kept emailing Spigen customer care and a gentleman named Avery kept assuring me that the case was going to ship soon or had shipped every few days until one day it actually did ship. &lt;---- This means its a good product but the customer service is pretty lousy in my opinion. No effort was made to compensate me for the extremely long wait other than Avery offering me a refund which I denied because I wanted the darn case.

B00D94RCV4,A33NVTVGAGUMHF,Brian Snyder,"[0, 0]","I don't expect much from most phone cases, and I usually just go to Five Below or other cheap retail store to get a case, because other than those $60 or up cases, they're all subject to the same issues...and with stores like Five below, I can get to check out a bunch of different options and even buy a few to see what works with me and what doesn't at a low financial risk. However, I recently just ordered the i-Phone 5s and want to make sure it's well taken care of and still looks and feels great.  I searched around for something decent, and I even considered going after a case that would save my 5s from any harm that could befall it...BUT I'm not chasing tornadoes or planning on taking wild trips through the wilderness, so I decided not to waste my money on anything like that.  Then I came across the SPIGEN SGP Neo Hybrid Case, watched the video review, and was intrigued.  Seemed to be just what I was looking for, and at the approx. $20 price, I figured why not? Fortunately, my phone and case arrived on the same day (as amazing as that could be!), and I was ready to go. According to the video review, I assumed it would be a little more fragile than it actually is. If the outer band is removed and replaced with care and patience, then it should last for quite awhile. Now, if you're heavy handed, then that's on you.  I also believe the grooved design on the inside will help out with any moderate impact issues the phone may experience. Nice, sleek, smooth design with an edge that I can appreciate. The headphone opening does present a bit of an issue, but it fits the Apple Earpods perfectly, and my other headphones with a larger jack size fit in nicely after a trip to see the exacto knife! I figured that the extra rubber/plastic around the jack that was preventing the jack from great access wouldn't be missed, and I was right. Of course, if it's all metal there, you won't be able to do that, but just a thought. This case is definitely not accident proof, but it offers decent protection if you take care of your phone.

It's not that I need a ton of different cases to go with my outfit, I just like a really nice case that is thin AND protects my phone completely. This case fits the bill!The thinnest cases I've found are the hard plastic ones that do not cover the top of the bottom of the phone. I have two of those, and don't use them often b/c the top and bottom of my phone gets banged up a bit when I put it in my car or desk. Hence I like the cases that cover the phone completely.This case is the thinnest I have used of the full cases. If you're like me and you HATE those cases that look like military armor and seem about 1&#34; thick, then this case is for you. I use a magnetic holder in my car, and it's important that the back material is thin so that the magnet can attract hard to the small metal disc I put between my phone and the case on the inside. No problems here.Some have complained that the plastic band around the outside is flimsy. Hogwash. Once you snap it on, it's not going to be flexing in different directions. Plus, the plastic band is sleek and shiny and very classy looking. The color really pops out on the band, much more than the pictures show.

Anyway, when I received my case, I had noticed that the packaging looked scratched up! That definetly made me feel as if my case wasn't too carefully handled..I opened the packaging, and only to realize that there was in fact, a stain on my case!  I had to use hand sanitizer, and a tissue to wipe it off. Definitely starting to think otherwise of this product and company.The good parts about this case, is that as I put this case on my phone, it fits nice and snug, as other reviews had said, and the anti shock patterns built into the back of the case is definitely a plus in my book.But UNFORTUNATELY, good things don't last long.  There is MORE bad news on this case. After using this case for no longer than a few days, i realized that the buttons are not &#34;clicky&#34; as other reviews claim this product is. This case, also ruins my signal more than i expected it too. This phone now makes my phone even warmer when i run high usage apps, resulting in even lesser battery life. The supposed &#34;anti fingerprint backside&#34; now has scratches from minimal usage, and being slid back into my pocket a few times. The aluminum band FEELS as if It will break, if I take it off even once. Finnally, the anti fingerprint backing does need to be wiped, in order to be &#34;free&#34; of any visible fingerprints.I am very self aware about all products I buy for my phone, and really, I have to say I am disappointed in what i wasted $30 of my hard earned money for.

I have dropped my phone 6 times and not one single scratch is on the case and the metallic surface still looks new.  I am very rough with my phone and this holds up well. A common complaint of other cases for the 5s is that the dual flash is blocked by the lack of a large hole cut out on the back of the case but this one is not a problem and the best part is the hard rubber back is easy to grip and soft enough to absorb an impact. The only issue I have with this case is that the only headphones and I mean the only headphones that will plug in is the Apple ones that came with the Iphone.

It helps preserve the thinness of the 5s.  I believe the protection is adequate and perfect for carrying the phone in your pocket.  The backside is not tacky and provides a reasonable grip.  The Tough Armor (have one of those too) case design allows for a better grip but the compromise is that it's bulkier than the Neo Hybrid but hugely improved over competitor's &#34;Tough&#34; cases.  I've seen some of those that look like bricks!  This is ideal when you're putting the phone in pants pockets.  Buttons on the phone appear to be metal, are of nice quality and provide a contrast to the color of the frame.As others have noted, the lip could be just a touch higher to provide more screen protection but it's OK as it is.  I'm sure the small lip helps preserve the thin design.  The cutout for the headphones is round, so I can imagine it's design will limit usage to select headphones.  Get bluetooth headphones and it's not a problem.The cutout for the lightning connector fits for Apple and Rocketfish so that worked for me.The one and only true flaw I see with this is that unless you have a longer nail, the mute button is hard to access.  The cutout around it is small.Some may prefer a cutout on the back of the phone to show the Apple logo on it and you'd think it would be easy enough to do since it's not much different than the cutout for the camera and flash.

Interestingly enough, I ended up using my first one the most and probably could have saved a lot of money.After I ordered my 5s from ATT online I came onto Amazon with a specific type of case in mind. I wanted:-something that was thin and wouldn't take away from the thinness of the 5s-a case that would still offer enough protection despite being low key and thin-had some protection on the front if for some reason i placed the phone down on the screen-does not interfere with putting on a screen protector-stylish with cool colors (the fact that this has interchangeable bumpers makes it even more desirable)-does not pick up crazy amount of fingerprints on the back-fits snug but isn't impossible to remove or put back on-cutouts are perfect and buttons etc. aren't difficult to use when case is on-has stellar reviews on Amazon and won't break the bankSo that's not a small list of requirements, but they are all things that IMO should be expected of a quality case worthy of a quality phone.After looking through 2-3 cases I came across this one and loved the look, reviews and the price wasn't too high.

Also purchased this case for my Galaxy S4 and also my Nexus 5 as well! Love the color scheme! Never really had a problem with these cases! Only one time had the button fell off, and that's because I take off the case once or twice a week to clean it out and clean my phone off. Works great with screen protectors, doesn't lift the screen protectors up like some other cases...Also works great with any tempered glass screen protectors as well. But keep in mind, the thicker the screen protector, the less of a &#34;lay on the table&#34; design you take away. I had on a Spigen Japanese screen protector, the regular plastic kind, and it left a settle &#34;lay on the table&#34; design for me to lay my phone flat down on the screen! Now once I added the Spigen 0.4 slim tempered glass screen protector, it left no room left. So when I lay my phone flat down on it's screen, the surface always touched my tempered glass screen protector. Which I didn't mind, cause when I do lay it down, i only lay it down on surfaces that won't scratch my phone, but I want to point that out to those who just lay their devices down on any surfaces! So warned!Pros:- Very sleek & slim (great stylish design) the gold matches the iPhone's gold very well!- buttons feel great when pressing into them- great that you can buy different color bands/bumpers- not slippery (at least for me it's not)Cons:- Can't use with charging docks or music/speaker stations- Volume & power/sleep buttons are silver and not gold- headphone jack & lightning cut-out can't fit &#34;certain&#34; third party cables- needs a bigger &#34;lay on the table&#34; design- camera cut out on the rear should be matching band too (personal preference)- price is a little high for a case that doesn't protect your device that well from drops (Otterbox commuter & defender on Amazon is around $20-$25)",5.0,1396396800,"04 2, 2014","iPhone 5S Case, Spigen Neo Hybrid Series for iPhone 5/5S - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate (SGP10360)",21.26,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414hzwXyzTL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1201},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

My two primary goals when buying a case are that it is sleek and looks cool. I don't really expect any case to hold up to a serious drop but I just want it to give my phone a chance. At the very least prevent a few scratches and dings. What I really like about this case is that it comes in two parts. One piece is almost like rubber (better than rubber because it's not sticky) and acts like an inner shell. The other piece is a clear coated outer shell. The outer shell not only enhances the look of the case, but it also provides a cover for the volume and power buttons. I'm not going to test it with any drops, but if I were to guess I'd say having two pieces will help it cushion a fall. I think it has been noted in another post that the bottom of the case is not completely flush with the lightning port. It is quite possible that any 3rd party cables will no longer fit.

The Slim Armor does not, so while they may look similar, they are quite different in this regard.Button cutouts- alignment is excellentFace frame height- the bumper goes all the way around, the heigh off the phone face is not massive, but it is enough so that your glass isn't rubbing any surface on which it may be laid.Cons:Paint plastic bumper- This could have been done better. It doesn't scream cheap chinese, but it does declare it in a moderate speaking voice. The finish could have been much better. Slim Armor wins hereMetalized buttons- Also a Pro, but the Con is the paint WILL wear and chip off. These buttons won't look good forever, and using real aluminum or a better finish would not be that much more cost prohibitive.Slim Armor wins here too.",4.0,1385337600,"11 25, 2013","iPhone 5S Case, Spigen Neo Hybrid Series for iPhone 5/5S - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate (SGP10360)",21.26,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414hzwXyzTL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1201},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

The inner rubber is flexible and pliable and absorbs a lot of shock.  I think one of the best features is the slightly raised lip such that if the phone is face down (or lands face down) the actual screen never makes contact with the ground.The angled flush with the camera/flash is definitely a plus as it feels smooth as compared to other cases where it is a sharp edge.

B00D94RCV4,A3CJ3DKELFXX59,TheR3alDanny,"[78, 84]","I have spent over $60 trying different cases(about 7 total) and finally came across this $22 Spigen Neo case.  At first, I was held back by the price as I normally don't spend over $20 for a case.  I usually buy Amazon Warehouse deals but went ahead and dished out the $20. My goal is to write good reviews while protecting my iPhone with only the best out there.  Well, I have FINALLY found it!  This Neo case is the king of cases!  It adds protection, no bulk, and my favorite feature....Tactile buttons! The metal slate is really cool.  Some users complain about the headphone jack and yea its a little small but I use Sennheiser HD 219's with no problem.  DJ style headphones should work fine.But, beware during install:  The ""bumper"" that goes over the TPU portion is very delicate.  This is definitely a case you don't want to remove/install too many times.  Inside it has very little ""clips"" that snap on to the TPU, on mine, I ALREADY broke half of two of the ridges.  It still holds, but I won't be removing it anytime soon unless I really have too.  I'm afraid i'll finish breaking them.  Read the instructions before installing.  I really hope Spigen warranties this part cause it too delicate for such a pricey case.Another cool thing about this case is it has a small lip that doesn't touch the screen protector.  You should have no problem having different size thickness screen protectors.  I currently have a Skinomi protector on the front and nothing on the back with no problem.Out of all the cases I've tried, I give this 9.5 out of 10.  My only ""con"" is the price which does not compensate thin, flimsy clips that hold the case to the TPU.  The outer bumper is VERY slim but its still a bada$$ phone case.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.The home button add-ons are okay.  I personally dont like them as they tend to press while in my pocket.  Mainly because the lip is very small so the home button add-on sticks out.**9/17/13 UPDATE**Still love the case but noticed something buyers should be aware of.  The outer shell/bumper feels like it'll break if you squeeze it too hard.  Another thing, I took this case apart to show my coworker what the inside looked like and the power button broke off.  Luckily I was able to pop it back into place.  I hope SPIGEN will sell the bumper/shells individually as I feel these will break if frequently removed/installed(I sent them a email about this and will update if they respond).**10/04/13 UPDATE**I received my replacement case on Monday after sending the broken one in last week.

I have the Neo Hybrid on my iphone 5, I really like the bumper looking fitting that slots over the black shell case. It keeps the sides of the case firmly in place with a nice feel.  The lip over the glass screen protector brings it flush to the lip of the case, not the safest option but I trust that the glass screen saver is there to protect the original glass of the iphone.  Both cases are excellent but I prefer slimmer cases (I previously had a thin Seido slide in case) but after installing a glass screen saver the Seido case no longer fits.

Just put on the TPU inside case and snap the bezel in place and you're good to go. I'm going to list a few pro's and consPros:Sexy looking case - Let's face it, this case is sexy as hellAll the cut outs are perfectly aligned. I'm not sure if I can add this as a pro since I think it should be standard that all cases have aligned cut outs but I'll add this to as a pro since I've used cases that had horrible cut outs.Protects all parts of your phone. Protects the back camera, all 4 corners, top and bottom and screen of your phone. It looks and feels like it can definitely take a few drops or two.A flat back. This case is one of the few cases that actually has a straight flat back. Most cases round off to a flat back but this case is straight up flat. It's really a personal pro since not a lot of cases do this.Cons:The snap on bezel. The bezel is where the sexiness of the case comes from but it's made of plastic. Once you drop your phone, it will damage the bezel and will leave an ugly dent or crack. Speigen doesn't sell the bezels separately so it isn't really cheap to just replace it.Slippery. Since your hands are mostly going to be holding on to the phone via the bezel and the back, this case isn't the best when it comes to being &#34;grippy&#34;. I like to hold my case naturally without much tension. With this phone, I feel like it might slip out of my hands if someone bumps into my lightly or something.Overall a great looking protective case.

I ordered the Dante Red case, while apperance wise it looks great, the red looks more like red with a slight orange hue, but looks good. My only complaint is the case makes the phone slippery! The smooth back and the ultra slick painted outer ring makes the phone more prone to being dropped. Either the back case or the outer ring should be ""grippy"" to aid in grip. That's the entire reason Samsung went with the faux leather back. I considered painting the ring with a matte color or plastidip. Who knows...

I've seen numerous youtube videos of this case review where the reviewer would take the two pieces of the case apart before installing their phone.  They would install the &#34;rubber&#34; part on the phone first and then try to fit the &#34;metal&#34; aluminum portion over the rubber portion.  DO NOT DO THIS!

Some people complain about the install, but if you install it as 1 piece and start with putting the bottom of the phone in first, its easy. The only downside I've found is that if you have bought any cheaper charging cords off of amazon or ebay for the Note 3, the base of the plug that connects to the phone is larger than that of the charger that come with the phone.

The back is smooth which some people may like, but I think adding a texture to it would help it feel less likely to slip from the hand. Same with on the sides.  They could have added some kind of non slip texture to the color on the sides where you grip the phone, or something and still kept a sleek look.Overall, I'm very happy with this case and recommend it.

B00DCIZJ5S,A1NOU98I7LCQSH,Joe Boo,"[34, 51]","Ordered early morning (like 4 AM CDT or 2 AM  PDT) on the day this case supposed became in stock and available, which was 10/7/13. I was expecting the 1-2 bus. day time around time for processing plus USPS mailing time like everyone else, so basically about a week for delivery as per Spigen's standard shipping policy in the domestic US. I was excited when the a shipping label was created on 10/11 and expected delivery early week of 10/13. However, like most other people only the label was created, but the package was never received by USPS. What this meant is that my account was charged the $24.99 as in Amazon's eyes the order was completed. However, after checking tracking status, even today, it still says USPS doesn't have the package.Sadly, no sorry for the delay in shipping or any kind of proactive correspondence on behalf of Spigen was sent to customers who bought their products in good faith. Any half-way decent and reputable company does this to reduce customer dissatisfaction, because sitting, waiting, and not knowing what is happening with the prolonged order process is worse than knowing what is really going on. It was up to me to contact Spigen on 10/14 due to their delays, which is atrocious customer service BTW. I have better luck with sellers from overseas on eBay who are more proactive and better at providing customer service than Spigen. However, brownie points are awarded to Spigen with a response the very next day (10/15).The reason for the delay, they claim, is due to a final quality check from the manufacturer and they aren't even in stock at their warehouse yet but are expecting them sometime this week. How does a company sell a product on Amazon that says it is in stock, when it isn't. Then, create a shipping label for a product they physically don't have yet. Finally, collect money from Amazon customer's because the order process is marked as complete when this label is created or after a certain period of time in which the order was created, whichever comes first.The bottom line is that I was counting on this product to help protect my device that retails for $699, now my phone has been naked for nearly 2 weeks too long. I am usually very careful on purchases online, but this has been the worst purchase experience I have had through Amazon or the internet in the last 15 years. I simply can't wait any longer. The kicker is that I can no longer cancel the order through Amazon as they have finalized the order despite the fact that the order is far from complete. I filed a complaint through Amazon, due me being charged for product that has never shipped and for Spigen selling an item they claim to have in stock when they clearly don't.I would normally go back to Incipio, but currently they are pre-order only basis with an estimated ship time of 2 weeks. Hey, at least they are upfront and honest. I would suggest to anyone that they look elsewhere for their Galaxy Note 3 Case needs, because in my eyes Spigen is not handling the &#34;unexpected&#34; delay very well from a customer standpoint. This was the first and most likely will be the last purchase of a Spigen product unless they create great customer service overnight.",1.0,1381881600,"10 16, 2013","Galaxy Note 3 Case, Spigen Neo Hybrid Series for Galaxy Note 3 - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate (SGP10452)",24.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mYIoTuPXL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3232},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

I read that you need to put the case on as one piece, not two like the instructions indicate.I have spent the last 40 minutes playing with this case to try and get it to fit properly and I just cannot do it. I have tried to put the case on as one piece and as two pieces, no go for me. Others may be able to do it, but it just does not work for me. I really do not think it should be this difficult anyway. I will give it another day and try a couple more times, but this case is most likely going back to Amazon.The case itself is actually quite nice. A bit slippery but it would seem to do a good job protecting the Note 3 if you happened to drop it from a normal height. It was packaged well but with very limited instructions, which normally would be fine, it is only a case after all. For me, since I cannot get the case to actually fit properly (The right side is not fitting correctly, so the face of the phone is actually above the case lip), so if it did drop, and happened to land on the face, it would probably break.I will update if I ever do get it to work.***12-18-2013 Update***I remembered today that I changed the battery door on my phone a few weeks ago. I purchased the Samsung OEM battery cover that allows you to charge the Note 3 using a Qi Wireless charger. Although it does not look any different than the original, the new back cover is actually a tiny bit thicker than the original. This explains why the case will not fit. I have also read some other comments on other sites that seems to confirm this conclusion.  So, it is not the case at all, it is the new wireless back that makes this case unusable for me. So, if you do go the wireless cover route, know that cases like this one will no longer work.

A great phone can be ruined by a bad case but a great case really improves the device experience.The case feels like it's really well made, it feels great in the hand and the yellow is a nice deep tone rather than a canary yellow.Installing it was a breeze.  Tip; Do not disassemble the case into its two components.  Leave it assembled and snap the phone in. Done!The colored bumper is made of a slick plastic to I will have to be a little more careful when holding the phone.  Coming from a grippy rubber case on my Note 2, everything does feel a little less sticky but the back has a rubber feel so there is still some traction available.  I'm not too concerned about it.The phone looks great in the case and it's not bulky.  If you're used to using a Note series phone, this case won't feel any bigger in the hand than the phone itself, in my opinion.One minor quip is that the ports for the stereo jack and the s-pen are a little deep.  It takes me more effort to get the S-Pen out and the stereo cable in my truck won't quite snap in with this case on it.  I'm going to just get a new cable.

I had a Caseology case and thought it protected well, although the few drops I had weren't anything major, but dropping a $700 phone is scary anytime lol. The Neo Hybrid is a two part case, and to fit it correctly, I put the rubber, or TPU part on first, then popped on the bumper or outer shell. It fits just fine, and man with the black Note 3 this case looks and feel about $50 more lol. It's really sleek... I can't explain it really. I wanted the red but I felt it would have been too red. Protection wise, seems like it would survive a good fall. You have two pieces working together to help protect your major investment. It has a lip on the front of the phone and a little lip for the camera. ONE MAJOR THING THO! The charging port with this case on only seems to accept usb 3.0 cords that have the same build as the cord that came with the phone. Cords that have those fat, thick ends won't even connect. For example, I bought a cable from a company called CableMatters and while the cable worked, was pretty thick, just an overall SOLID usb cable, it just didn't fit with the Hybrid case on because the end was too thick. There's a few cables with those smaller ends on Amazon that you can buy if your Samsung cable messed up (like mine did). Check Elite Tech on Amazon for one.

B00DCIZJ5S,A22RS9XNLGIRSF,Michael St James,"[0, 0]","This is a sleek, elegant case for the GN3. I have no complaints about the fit or finish, I installed the GN3 with the plastic ring in place as recommended by other buyers, and this worked very well. The fit is snug and secure. I had previously installed a Verizon branded  tempered glass screen protector, and the edge of the case matched up very well with the edges of this protector. There is nothing wrong with this case. I bought a case designed for beauty and elegance, and that is exactly what this case is. However, I need a little more protection. I need a slightly deeper inset for the screen to protect it when face down. I need a grippier surface on the edges. The plastic bezel is very shiny and very slippery. The case is quite thin, maintaining the sleekness of the GN3, but in combination with the glossy edge surfaces, it means that picking up the phone from a table or desk requires a very firm grasp. The case slides very easily into and out of a front pocket, and thinness is a virtue in this respect. However, going back to my need for a grippier edge, I took GREAT care when removing the phone from my pocket to avoid losing it on the way out. The buttons are very functional, and the pressure needed to activate is just right.In summary, if you need a sleek and fashionable case that will enhance the elegance of the GN3 while giving fairly good protection in gentle use, you can't go wrong with this case. I ended up returning it in favor of a case with a little less elegance and a little more ruggedness. I will review those cases separately.

I just like enjoying the look/feel of the phone as it was made/designed. This changed when I got my Note 3 because it is just a bigger phone that I just didn't feel as confident holding.When I decided to get a case, I wanted to find 1-2 cases that were lightweight and added minimal size/bulk to the Note 3. I choose:1. The Spigen Slim (Ultra Fit)2. Spigen Neo HybridI will post pictures of the phone &#34;naked&#34; and with each case for comparison.Now for the Neo Hybrid... The case fits fairly well. There was a little more give than I expected once  the case was on, but it was still very snog. It was fairly easy to get on if you follow the directions.However, my major complaint (for my needs) is that this just ruins the look and feel of the Note 3. Yes, I want my phone protected, but not at the cost of making it look/feel like I am carrying around a rubber brick. This is far from the chunkiest case out there and Spigen did a great job of offering a &#34;sleek&#34; case that is also protective, but it just doesn't suit my needs. Besides the blocki-ness of the case, the case was designed well and looks appealing - albeit blocky.If you are looking for a protective case that looks pretty nice for its type, than this case may be fore you.

I thought this one would fit the bill, but the backing is still fairly slick and slides off my console.

I was really leaning towards the ultra fit, but ended up going with this due to the balance of slimness, protection, and looks. This feels really good in your hand with the bumper giving it a solid edge. I also liked how the buttons were built in so you aren't having to dig your fingers into a recess to hit them. I was worried they wouldn't work very well, but I've had no problems with them at all.I went for the silver surround and it looks fantastic with the black note 3. It adds very little to the width and height of the phone, and less than I was expecting from the pictures. I would definitely pay more for a real aluminum surround. The only downside to the looks is while the flat black back looks great, it does show fingerprints fairly easy, but I'm hoping that will even out over time.The stock back makes the camera stick up higher than anything else so you feel bad setting it down anywhere. With this case, the flat back and sharp thin surround around the screen give you a nice surface to rest it either way. Definitely recommend this one as one of the best all around case.",5.0,1391558400,"02 5, 2014","Galaxy Note 3 Case, Spigen Neo Hybrid Series for Galaxy Note 3 - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate (SGP10452)",24.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mYIoTuPXL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3232},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"
B00DCIZJ5S,A1OPKNO7IXWV27,R. Southern,"[1, 1]","When I got my Note 3 I was worried it would be too big, but the phone's design is slim and manageable. I got used to the bigger size quickly.Then I got this Spigen case since I was concerned about dropping my new phone. Well, I'm mixed.On one hand the case is great. A perfect fit and offering reasonable drop protection for the corners and sides. With this and a screen protector I feel the phone is very safe from accidental slips.One the other hand, the phone is quite a bit bulkier now. I miss the sleek phone and several people have joked that I'm carrying a tablet with me. It does fit in my front pocket of my Dockers well, but not so much with jeans.I think the trade-off is worth it, so I can have the peace of mind that comes from knowing that accidentally dropping the phone when getting out of the car or walking between meetings won't destroy my new phone. When I feel the need to have a slim phone the case is fairly quick to remove, you don't need to disassemble the colored plastic surround from the softer rubber material, just peel the entire thing off, both parts together, from the bottom edge of the phone.All the cutouts, buttons (volume and power) and mic/headphone holes are perfectly aligned, and the case is very well made with nice molded lettering for the ""13 mega"" (under camera lens), ""Neo Hybrid"" (bottom right edge) and ""Spigen"" (back, bottom right). The pen is easy to access too, although fat fingers may have a problem getting it out since the cutout doesn't allow a lot of extra space.Overall, this is a well made case of good materials. I'd buy it again and will look at this brand for my other case needs in the future.Update March 4, 2014: I had installed this case on my Note 3 using the OEM back. I will be using the wireless charging back from Samsung and installed it today to find that this case no longer fits. The Spigen case is such a perfect fit for the stock phone that even the extra millimeter of thickness of the wireless back is too much. Sadly, I will need to return this case, however in the few days that I got to use it, it was nice. I won't take away any stars due to this sizing problem, but perspective buyers should be aware this will only fit correctly with the non-wireless charging back cover from Samsung.",4.0,1393286400,"02 25, 2014","Galaxy Note 3 Case, Spigen Neo Hybrid Series for Galaxy Note 3 - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate (SGP10452)",24.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mYIoTuPXL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3232},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B00DCIZJ5S,A14U0EPYCA40D0,Scorpion E,"[0, 0]","I almost didn't buy the Neo Hybrid case for my Note 3 because of all the negative reviews regarding poor fit.  I'm glad the other positive reviews convinced me to give it a try anyway.Bought a satin silver case for Note 3 from Spigen Inc. fulfilled by Amazon.  Came in as promised in two days.  Thanks Amazon.  The case came in proper packaging.  As soon as I opened it up, I fell in love with it.  It is just beautiful; not a single blemish on it.  I knew right away how to install it thanks to all the reviewers who gave the wonderful installation tip.  I just installed the case in one piece and the phone easily popped in perfectly.  Everything lined up correctly; no gaps on the sides at all.  I was going to use this case with either the Spigen glass screen protector or the one by Bodyguardz but their thickness drew me towards Bear Motion's premium glass screen protector instead which is half their thickness at .2 mm.  While a few suggested the .4 mm glass protectors work fine with this case, the thinner one allowed the button to sit almost flushed with the glass protector without needing to install a home button sticker.  The bump from the Neo Hybrid that protects the phone's screen also sits higher.Although this case added some bulk to the thin and light Note 3, the added protection and sleek look more than made up for it.  If your hands are small and are already struggling with holding the phone, I suggest you look elsewhere.  This case simply blends with the phone as if it came with the phone from the manufacturer.  While it's a little slippery compared to other cases, it allows me to easily slip the phone in and out my jean pocket.  The only two things that I wish Spigen would change are the sizes of both the headphone jack and charging ports holes.  The rest of the case can remain as perfect as it is now.

The Note 3 is a little too big of a phone. I truly believe a 5&#34; screen'd phone are the perfect size (Nexus 5, Galaxy S4 for examples). That said, I've had this phone for about a month now and I've gotten used to it. I've gotten used to it to the point of holding my fiancee's Galaxy S4 and thinking, &#34;It's small.&#34; I know this is just adaptation of the human mind, but it doesn't change the fact the Note 3 is hard to use one handed and sometimes, I need one handed operations. Yes I know there's a mode for &#34;One handed operation,&#34; but that just further proves my point that the phone is a tad too big and apparently Samsung knows it.I love the phone, don't get me wrong, but where it stands without a case is where I want it to be size wise.So I opted for Spigen's advertised &#34;thin&#34; case. When it arrived it added so much bulk that the phone felt like a monster. It was just too much for me to enjoy. I have a spot in my Volkswagen CC that was designed to hold phones. The Note 3 by itself fits fine. With the Spigen, it doesn't at all.So due to this I cannot recommend this case to anyone that already thinks the Note 3 is pushing it.If the Note 4 gets any larger I will not own one.",1.0,1384992000,"11 21, 2013","Galaxy Note 3 Case, Spigen Neo Hybrid Series for Galaxy Note 3 - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate (SGP10452)",24.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mYIoTuPXL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3232},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B00DCIZJ5S,A2XOW3I6FV0CBC,Vito Cafarelli,"[0, 1]",Let me start off by what's bad about the case. The main issue I have with the case is that there is zero grip provided. This is one of the slipperiest cases out there.. What's the point of having a slippery case especially on the note 3. The phone tends to want to leave your hand. Second.. the case does add a bit of weight and bulk  to the phone. (Although it's not as bulky as the bulkier cases out there but it's definitely not a slim case either)  3rd and this is a minor issue.  This black and red case i got does not look good with the white note 3 because the black TPU over laps the red bumper and when you stare at the front of the phone there is a mesh of 3 colors which just looks messy.  Now what I do like about the case is how nice it looks. The case doesn't look cheap and has nice quality feel to it.

When I bought the Note 3 I decided I would care for the phone and make sure it always had full protection.  When I ordered the case it was on back order, so I had to wait 5 days.  Once I got it, if the case they send it in is any indication of the protection of the phone, I got the right case.  It was really easy to install, I just pushed in the upper half in and snapped in the bottom in.  I did have to do it twice as it didn&#8217;t pick up my s view right away.  Once I got it in and I made sure the phone was securely in the case, I made sure the contact on the back of the phone was completely together.  Calls and s-view worked great.  It does add a little weight, but for the protection it&#8217;s worth it to me.  I like that over the Samsung case this one comes with a snap, so you don&#8217;t have to purchase an extra magnet.  I originally bought the Samsung case and returned it.  I also like the hinge, since there aren&#8217;t any good options out there for a Note 3 case with full protection and a kickstand; this case gets you as close as possible.

Unfortunately that did not last. The part of the case that holds the door and the hinge together snapped off and essentially the case came apart.Luckily for me Spigen announced that they would cover this cases for an extra 2 years or so with their new cases and I was told on twitter that it also applied to their past cases (I forget exact coverage years). I was able to get a replacement by sending them photos via twitter and email and I honestly expected to get brand new case but no. What I got was a replacement door. I contacted them again and sent them better photos and told them that the door is not the only thing broken. They apologized and sent me the plastic cover that holds the hinge and door and goes over the silicone portion of the case. At this point I just gave up and used what they gave me since it worked...for a month.That same plastic part of the case broke and the door continues to pop out now but they have not responded to my twitter complaints and frankly I am tired of their slow service so a negative review it is.I have never dropped my phone, banged it or let if take any damage. All I do is put it in my front pocket and attach it to my car dock that is all and yet the case does not last.",2.0,1405900800,"07 21, 2014","Galaxy Note 3 Case, Spigen Slim Armor Case for Galaxy Note 3 - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate (SGP10457)",19.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mpNMMPjNL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 11239},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

I looked at Otterbox but it was a little too big especially since the note 3 is already a huge phone.  Putting on a Otterbox would make the phone look like a brick. I looked and looked for a case that was slim, had the Sview feature, and had protection all around.  This is it.  This is THE case for all you tech junkies.  This case is full body protection especially the screen.  It is hard body unlike the soft body ones you find on the market.  Also, the clasp is a definite winner.  On some other sview cases, the front cover would dangle and over time it would become loose and unstable. The cover is well made, from a hard plastic and i feel it won't become loose over time.  This is the opposite of the negatives of the soft sview covers.  Also, if you want, the s view cover is removable.  The case itself is a bit slick all over but I don't mind it at all.  As long as it covers and protects my phone, I'm all for it.I would recommend this to anyone who loves Otterbox and any full body protection case but want a slim and hardbody sview case that you won't regret.

B00DCIZJEY,A2DRBOQZWSDK3R,C. Pease,"[0, 0]","This case is absolutely gorgeous looking.  I feel that it would also provide a good level of protection for the GN3.  The lip around the screen is not very high though (not like an Otterbox Commuter).The thing that I really don't like at all is the texture of the hard plastic outer shell.  The colored shell is very slippery.  Because of the slippery nature of the colored plastic, the phone is very hard to grasp securely.  I'm always afraid that when I go to pick the phone up, after it has been sitting on a desk or table, I am going to drop it.This case, for me, does not instill a feeling of security while holding the phone.  The colored hard outer shell needs to have a rubber grip along both sides below the power and volume rocker.  This design would provide something sticky rather than slippery to assist grasping the phone when lifting it from a table or desk -  or even while holding the phone during use.  I would then give it 5 stars.Let's face it, unless you are buying this just to change the appearance of the phone, it is supposed to provide protection for your expensive device.  Why would any manufacturer make a case that could actually help you drop your phone.After I removed this case from my phone, I felt that the naked phone actually had more grip than with the case.The Spigen &#34;BOUNCE&#34; or Otterbox &#34;Commuter&#34; are both much better cases if you want something that feels secure and grippy in your hand.Because a case is supposed to help protect your phone, not help you drop and damage your device, I can only give the Slim Armor Case 2 stars.

B00DCIZJEY,A3P8Z4OR28VZFS,"D. Bayne ""aka &#34;DanDroid&#34;""","[0, 0]","I received my Auto Sleep/Wake Case exactly on the expected due date and was, based on a lot of the previous reviews here, prepared to have to fiddle with it extensively to get the case to work with the S-View Window.  Thankfully, I did not have to do any tricks to get it to work correctly.SETUPPrior to installing the case, I activated some of the S View Cover options first by going to Settings> General> Accessory> and go to the S View Cover Section and check ""Automatic unlock"" and change colors for the window, etc.To get the case on, you have to remove the OEM battery cover. After that, line up the S View chip on the case with the pins on the phone and press the phone into the case. It's as simple as that. From what I heard, if these pins don't line up exactly, the S View feature will not work. I'm not sure if Spigen made adjustments to the chip after customer complaints; however, I had no issue with loose chips or misalignments.BUILD QUALITY/MaterialsObviously, the makers of this case gave lots of thought and effort into developing the case. This is evident in how perfectly the cutouts are and the lack of gaps. This makes for a very good hold of the phone.  The phone never moves inside of the case. The case is done so well, in fact, that you could almost think it was made by Samsung.  One thing to note, although all the holes line up, some headphone jacks will NOT work in this case, if they are of the larger variety.I found 3 negatives with the build materials: the S View Window ""glass"", the soft-feel matte finish (in this case, black) and the hinge material:1 & 2) The glass is a FINGERPRINT MAGNET. It shows everything. Fingerprints, oil, etc. This wouldn't be a problem if the glass could be easily wiped clean. For my first day, I used EVERYTHING imaginable to clean the glass, short of Windex. All the materials used simply smeared the oil and fingerprints. Finally I cut a small, 4""x4"" piece of ""Sham-Wow"" and used that to wipe the front of the case and it works perfectly.  It's a shame, though, that you HAVE to keep wiping the window, if you want it to look decent.  Same goes for the finish of the entire case. It shows every little fingerprint and oil. On the flip-side, it is indeed easier to wipe these blemishes away.3) For such a tough case, the hinge that marries the front window cover to the rest of the case appears to be SUPER flimsy. So much so, I open the front cover very carefully every single time. Maybe if it were built of metal painted black to match, I'd feel more secure.IN-HAND FEELClosed, the case feels nice and solid in-hand. There is a little added heft to the overall weight of the phone, which for me is a plus. The phone no longer feels fragile and delicate. While there IS added heft, the overall size of the phone doesn't appear to have gotten much bigger/thicker.  People with small hands will notice a difference (I have small hands), but it's not a deal breaker.One of the selling points is that the front cover is able to open fully and be folded all the way to the back of the case. This 1) gets the cover out of the way while also 2) enabling the case to act as a stand. In landscape, simply fold the case back so that it's about 25 degrees from the back of the phone and put it down. Now you have an instant fairly stable stand. Nice.  One of the negatives, though, with the front cover folding all the way back, is that the plastic eats into your hands when holding it.  You literally have to change the way you hold the phone in order to keep your hands from hurting. For me, this was ok, as I'm adaptable to change. For some, this may be an irritation.PROS+Very well made, fits the phone perfectly+Full protection without adding TOO much bulk+The S View function works flawlessly+Front cover folds all the way back+Case can operate as a ""landscaped mode"" standCONS-Entire case and S-View window is a fingerprint magnet-Large headphone jacks do not work-With the cover fully open and on back of the case, causes discomfort to the handsWith that said, I DO like the case, but wouldn't give it a 5 star rating.

I picked up a cheap, vinyl case for $15. If you don't know anything about Cellairis kiosks, the cases they offer are $5 ebay and flea market fodder, only typically marked up to $35+. So that tells you how flimsy and cheap the $15 case I bought is...but the S View worked flawless. I figured it would do me until I could get home and research for better.So, I come upon this case here. I didn't really get a good take on the reviews on Amazon due to this case sharing reviews with Spigen's less problematic offerings (oh touche Amazon/Spigen. Well played.) Anyhow, once I received my Slim Armor View, put it on my phone...I was outraged at how poorly the S View worked. Android 4.3 mind you....I really, really love this case other than the S View not working. So I did more research, found that this is common and that Spigen would offer a replacement chip...so I emailed Spigen CS. Within a few days I received a replacement chip...followed the instructions to the letter...to no avail. The new replacement chip performed as badly as the old one.So as I'm about to package this all up to send back, it dawned on me. ""Why not try the chip from the cheap-o, mall crappy case inside the SAV...?"" So I did, and low and behold, my Slim Armor View S View is now working flawlessly.I'm a bit miffed that some knock-off mall fodder company got the chip right, where a company like Spigen could miss the boat entirely.I'm still giving 3 stars because Spigen was quick to respond, tried the rectify the issue, their Slim Armor View is a really nice, protective case other than S View issues...and I got it to work, so I am personally happy.

It truly is.I have tried cases from Otterbox, Incipio, Caseology, Hyperion, Speck, and others.This particular Spigen case beats all of the other cases out indefinitely.Although it does add some bulk to the phone, I feel like it's a good type of bulk.My Note III feels much more substantial and just feels more stable to me.However, the glossy back of the case + small hands = A tough to grip Note with one hand.Buttons feel great to push, very tactile, I don't think that accidental button presses will be a problem.All the cut-outs for speaker, camera, etc are right on point. The cut-out for the S Pen is a welcomed addition.Overall, I love the design and protection that the case provides the end user.I think that it's a good investment for anyone.I used to buy a variety of cases to switch out, but I am pretty sure that i'll stick to this one case for a very long time.It's just that good.",5.0,1383264000,"11 1, 2013","Galaxy Note 3 Case, Spigen Slim Armor Case for Galaxy Note 3 - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate (SGP10457)",19.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mpNMMPjNL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 11239},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B00DCIZJEY,A1SYMH8YEJ8JLH,Hana Bee,"[0, 0]","The Good:  I was pleasantly surprised by this case at first.  It has a very cool and protected feel to it.  The finish is smooth, but not slippery, so it will easily go into a pocket (if you have one large enough!), but still has a 'grip' to it in the hand.  It took some help from a Verizon rep to get the S-view working properly (there are some settings to be changed in order to be able to check messages from the front screen.  But once I had that done, the front screen was very convenient!The Bad:  As others have said, the audio jack port isn't easily accessible to many headphones with the case on.  The front cover is difficult to open with one hand, unless you can brace it against something while popping it free.  It folds all the way to the back, but will obstruct the camera viewfinder in that position.  With the cover open, it feels very awkward - kind of flops all over the place.  I wish that it had the capability to hold a 'propped up' position for hands-free viewing.  I have noticed that it will kind of 'space out' when the cover is left open for too long.  A restart of the device solved the problem - until now...The Ugly:  Just got the Kit Kat 4.4.2 update this morning and wa-la!  The s-view no longer works on the case.  I will be spending some time researching a solution before getting a new case, but I do wish I hadn't spent so much on this one.Update:  After some Googling, I found a recommendation to remove the phone from the case and restart.  After re-inserting the phone, the s-View now works again!!  Hopefully, this fix will last.

The added size does translate into an enhanced confidence in the protection offered to the device. The glass screen protector fits without a pause for concern. Buttons and ports are perfectly sized and located. This is a tank of a case no doubt but the gloss fish of the hard skeleton back cover is unattractive.. especially in the black that I chose. When polished it is beautiful to see but that effect is short lived and the OCD in me causes me to constantly be wiping the case clean. As far as my number one Spigen case?

It replaces the original battery cover of your Galaxy Note 3, but it is impossible to open the flap with one hand, the latch is too hard to push open with your thumb. The other problem I have with mine is that the flap does not turn off my screen. When the flap is shut the phone is supposed to display a smaller image through the window where you can answer calls or take notes etc. Mine stopped doing that after a few uses and never turned back to normal. I tried resetting the phone by taking the battery out and putting it back in, but didn't help. My older Samsung leather cover works fine with the screen, so it is not my phone. If I wasn't using my phone 40-50 times a day, I would have lived with this cover, but not being able to open the cover with one hand and not being able to answer without opening the cover, I will give it a low rating.",2.0,1396224000,"03 31, 2014","Galaxy Note 3 Case, Spigen Slim Armor Case for Galaxy Note 3 - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate (SGP10457)",19.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mpNMMPjNL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 11239},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B00DCIZJEY,A2E2I580OO3HET,"M. Broderick ""mikebinok""","[2, 2]","To begin with, I am reviewing the soft black S-View version of this cover. Amazon has intermingled the reviews for S-view and non S-view versions, so make sure the review you read applies to the case you want to buy!I was concerned about reports of problems using these cases that may or may not be associated with  the kit kat update. My phone is not yet on kit kat. I absolutely loved the similar Spigen case for my Galaxy S4, so I went ahead and bought one of these, ordering it ahead of time so it would be on hand when I became eligible for a subsidized phone upgrade!Just like the S4 case, this one looks to give reasonably good protection to the phone. To get better protection than this, you'd have to go with the Otterbox Defender or a similar massively bulky case. Even this case adds a small amount onto both sides of every dimension. I still can fit it into my front jeans pocket for easy carrying, but it isn't as instinctive to slide it in as it was on smaller phones. The soft black has a soft, fairly grippy feel that makes my grip on the phone feel good. This is an excellent choice, not quite as good as the coating on the Seidio cases I've used, but very usable. I handled a white Spigen case for the S4 that had a much slicker feel, and wouldn't have made me comfortable for fear I'd drop it, I assume that the white Note 3 case is the same more slippery material.To my relief, when I removed the back cover of my phone and inserted it into the case, it worked perfectly. None of the reported problems. The next morning, I was disturbed to find that the auto-on and auto-off features of the case were now NOT working! I took the phone out and reinserted it into the case, and everything was fine. I'm hoping that is the end of the matter, but uncertainty makes me give the case four stars rather than five. If I go for a few weeks without more trouble, I'll try to remember to come back here and upgrade my rating to five stars.ADDED LATER: unfortunately, I had two more failures of the S-View feature to work within 24 hours. Removing and replacing the phone in the case seemed to fix the problem, but this is unacceptable. I lost confidence in the place and have asked for a refund. Back to Amazon it will go. I used the case for a one more day until I could get a replacement regular case, and found that it works unreliably. It is unfortunate, because I love this case on my Galaxy S4.

B00DCIZJEY,AP3N6KOLIFYVY,P. Kang,"[0, 0]","Best case available for Note 3 if you are looking for complete protection with a slimmer profile (removed back cover) & S-View functionality.  My wife bought this for me as part of my birthday gift so the actual purchase is under her Amazon account.  This case will COMPLETELY protect your phone, without a doubt.  It has a solid feel to it and I'm not afraid if I happen to drop it on gravel or concrete.  It gets an A+ for case protection and durability.  I have been using it a couple of months now.  There are a few common complaints that I want to address from other reviewers.S-View - I know many people, including myself, had an issue with the S-View function.  It would stop working and to get it to work again I had to take the case off.  If you have this problem, send an email to Spigen.  They quickly sent me over a new chip to replace the one in the case.  It works perfectly now!  I was ready to return the case but decided to reach out to Spigen first to give them a chance to do the right thing.  I would have given 3/5 stars with a case that had a dysfunctional feature but Spigen customer service provided me a quick fix in replacing the chip.Hinge - I read previous reviews saying that the hinge is a weak point and can break easily.  While this may be true, if you drop your phone when the case is opened and the hinge breaks; I don't blame the hinge for breaking.  There may be merit that the hinge is inherently weak but if it breaks because I dropped the phone that isn't the cases' fault but mine.Final thoughts:Compared to the price of the Samsung S-View case, this is a bargain.  I had the Samsung S-View case but I wanted something that offered better overall protection.  Would recommend to all my family, friends and Amazon users.  One more thing I wanted to add concerning the Samsung S-View case; the front cover would flap or wouldn't close properly.  Spigen makes a magnetic clip that works perfectly for this problem.  I gave my old case to my dad and bought the magnetic clip for him.

B00DD62R40,A1MMEARDASNIA0,NJP (Ohio),"[6, 9]","I am apparently overly picky about phone cases, evidenced by the fact I can never find one I like. I thought my criteria was fairly simple: A case/bumper that provides some edge protection (will never get a lot of drop protection from one of these), fits snugly and doesn't pull-away/warp, looks of professional quality that matches the quality of the phone itself, feels good in the hand (neither slippery, tacky, nor ""chalky""), doesn't interfere with phone functionality, ports, etc.,  and doesn't add too much bulk to the original phone design. Yeah, maybe that's asking too much.But finally, I tried this new Slim Armor S. It is wonderful, and fits every criteria.  It was hard to tell from descriptions and photos whether the inner shell was soft rubber (as on the Neo cases) or would be more rigid. I'm happy to say the top and bottom sections (that are exposed) are more rigid (almost like a hard plastic, but not quite) and hold their shape well - and don't collect lint. The back plate snaps on securely and feels and looks great. I purchased the gunmetal which looks nice, but I was torn between that and the slate - I'm sure either would look equally good. The slate would probably look more like the actual iPhone 5 back, but the gunmetal adds a nice bit of contrast/color.Overall I am very happy with this. I'd love to have a standard Neo Hybrid to compare, but I don't think I'd like to full rubber back, as opposed to the solid back on the Slim Armor S. I tried the Neo Hybrid EX Slim (no back) and did not like it - cutouts for ports were too small even for some of Apple's own connectors, and it just didn't provide a secure feel to me.",5.0,1379635200,"09 20, 2013","iPhone 5S Case, Spigen Slim Armor S Case for iPhone 5/5S - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate (SGP10365)",24.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TpP7TIz7L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 5267},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

If you have short nails, it is just about impossible to get the phone from loud to silent. I have to use something really thin to put in there and put the switch back down. Silent to loud is slightly easier but it still requires so effort and concentration. This is a very frustrating part of the case to the point that I'm torn between returning it and keeping it. The other buttons are all easy to push. I have yet to test out the headphone jack out on larger cords but if it fits my aux cord in my car I may consider raising the rating to four stars. The lightening connector space is quite large and will probably fit most larger third party chargers.

B00DD62R40,A3JA4JDIWIOO06,SVC,"[0, 0]","I took a chance on this case based on reviews and I'm glad I did. I love the two-tone look and have gotten several envious looks and even a couple family members have ordered their own.It's a great fitting case and truly is the slimmer version as advertised. The protection is solid and feels great in your hand. The top and bottom of the phone have a more rubbery coating which provides just the right amount of grip. It does have the &#34;lip&#34; that comes up on TOP of the glass just ever so slightly (it almost sits back at the metal frame but not quite). As a result, if you get something like a Zagg screen cover, ask for the case friendly design that backs off the edges by a mm or so. I didn't and it still has been ok and not bunched or pushed the screen cover. But it's close enough I would have like the extra room.Most importantly to me, you can tell this case was designed with the phone in hand and not just slapped together from leaked specs. The buttons work perfectly, the cutouts are just right and there is no slack or slop in the fit of the frame around the edges. Even the bottom lip under the home button is still sturdy and straight after a couple months.This case loses a star for me with the wear on the backplate. As others have commented, it wears ridiculously quick. I have two roundish spots on the top and bottom of the backplate where the material has worn enough that it's no longer the same shine as the rest of the backplate. Plus there are a bunch of scratches all over the back, but they aren't very noticeable and ONLY on the backplate.But overall, that isn't noticeable enough or significant enough to detract from the case overall. If they could just fix that one issue, the case would be perfect in my eyes.",4.0,1387324800,"12 18, 2013","iPhone 5S Case, Spigen Slim Armor S Case for iPhone 5/5S - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate (SGP10365)",24.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TpP7TIz7L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 5267},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

I looked pretty obsessively at many cases offered on Amazon until I found this one. Search over. This is a two piece case like the commuter but unlike the soft silicone inner layer of the commuter, this case has a rigid rubber inner layer. It does not lose its shape or integrity even though it is not wrapped on all sides by the plastic shell. The two pieces fit over the phone very snugly but is still fairly easy to get off and on.

What I absolutely couldn't stand with this case is that power and volume button guards stood out past the edge of the case, so far that If I squatted down for any length of time, the tension of my jeans pressing on the phone in my pocket would either turn off my phone or restart it because the power button was being held down.

The otterbox may be the tanks of all tanks, but it looks like crap and it is huge. I could never carry a phone with a otterbox case in my pocket.

Since I have not dropped my phone, I cannot speak to its durability, but it sure feels durable.For those who are concern with the power button issue, my workaround was an app called &#34;Gravity Screen.&#34; Basically when I place the phone face down onto a table, it will shut off. When I turn it over facing me, it will turn on. Also, if you place the phone into your pocket, it shuts off. The app is not a battery drainer either.

Spigen sent me a new and updated TPU soft case + a free screen protector (If only I knew, because I ordered their separate 3pcs screen protector. Ohh well.) Although it took a while for spigen's customer service to reply I still think they're one of the few companies out there that really value customer service; and for that I think they're awesome.The Slim armor is now my main case. I'm still using the old TPU soft case that I ""fixed"" by cutting and making it fit correctly. The new TPU case seem unresponsive compared to the old TPU case that I ""fixed"".Overall I'm happy with the product.

B00EV8Y4QI,A2L113YBLKJD5Y,Jeremy Kane,"[0, 0]","I got this case along with 2 other slim cases, not sure which I'd want to use long-term. After trying all three, I quickly decided that the protection of this (slightly) bulkier case made it my choice. The design is good, and I like the polycarbonate shell inset. I also liked how it added a level of grip that the other cases did not (and the phone itself doesn't really, either).I used this case on my Nexus for around 2 weeks, and then started noticing that the polycarbonate shell was not fitting in the inset as well as it had at the start. For someone who is finicky about the fit and finish of things, this didn't sit well with me. It was as if the rubber part of the case fit exactly right, but the shell was slightly too large - it bowed out just a little from the rest of the case. When I ran my finger along the back of the phone, it would catch on the shell. It's only a couple of millimeters, probably, but it was enough that it bothered me.I tried removing the shell and bending it JUST slightly in the opposite direction, I even thought about gluing it, but I don't believe glue would hold it.  So ultimately, I switched to one of the other cases. As much as I like the design and extra protection of the Spigen Slim Armor case, the end result is I'm not using it on my phone.  If they can figure out a way to resolve that problem, I'd switch back to it in a heartbeat. So, if you aren't bothered by slight issues like that, I'd highly recommend this case.  If, though, you are slightly (or extremely, even) OCD, then this case might not be for you.",3.0,1401321600,"05 29, 2014","Nexus 5 Case, Spigen Slim Armor Case for Nexus 5 - Retail Packaging - Smooth Black (SGP10569)",16.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41543rvrsSL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2135},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

The look & feel of that one was spot on, it just didn't protect well for the few drops I had.When I got this Spigen case, I immediately noticed how much much thicker it was than I could have expected. Not a fan of how it looks either. It really does look pretty awesome in the photos, just not what I expected in person. I can't stress how much bulkier the phone feels. This case is great for people with larger hands. It isn't that it is unusable, it is just so uncomfortable. I just don't think it's nearly as thin as the pictures make it out to be.My biggest gripe is that some of my chargers don't fit right when the case is on, where as ALL of them fit with the LG case. My phone was dead this morning as a result because I guess I didn't realize the USB cord wasn't pushed in all the way, or so I thought. Turns out that it eventually slips out after a short while. Thus, I really can't use this as a daily case. Maybe I'll slap it on when going hiking or camping or during a Zombie Apocalypse.I DO very much like that when the swivel door is open and behind the case, it doesn't cover the camera -- that was the primary reason I went with this Spigen case. You can see the clock through the window when the swivel door is closed and you push the power button, which is pretty cool. It looks like it will protect the phone very very well, I will definitely commend that.I haven't tried any third party apps so I have nothing to share about that.

This case is simply a beast... by far the thickest, bulkiest case I've seen for the Nexus 5.  That said, it does what it was designed to do - protect your phone from a fall.  I suspect it may also stop bullets and allow you to bludgeon wildebeest should the need arise or the mood strike you.If you want the ultimate protection for your Nexus 5 and don't care about bulk, this case is for you!  Absolutely great for people who don't need to put their phones in their pockets. The one drawback is that the retaining surround will push up an edge-to-edge screen protector - if you have one on your phone, it will peel up.  Be prepared to either cut your screen protector down to size or run without one.If you want to throw your phone on the ground, drop it off buildings or the like, then you should consider this case.

The glas.t fits very nicely with both cases, my friends don't even notice it's on. You do have to take care when installing it to have it fit right. If it's off by even a tiny bit the lip of the cases will start to peel up the edge of the protector. Also, there is just enough of a gap between the case and the protector that lint and dust can build up in an unattractive ring all the way around the screen. Qi charging works with both cases just as well as with the phone naked.I broke my Nexus 4 recently (dropped it without a case on) and was very disappointed by the aesthetics of the Nexus 5, possibly the ugliest product Google or LG have ever made. Enter Spigen. Both of the cases are very stylish and give the phone a much better feeling (not to mention, let it lay flat on a table ...geez LG, what were you thinking!) I actually prefer the subtle accent color and chrome buttons of the Neo Hybrid case, and don't feel like I'm giving up very much in protection. I'm used to an OtterBox commuter case, and both the Neo Hybrid and the Slim Armor feel more cosmetic than protective. Maybe smartphone case engineering has just advanced enough that we don't need very much bulk around a phone to protect it...

The biggest difference I notice is how easy it is to use the buttons. It looks premium, like something that costs twice as much. It still maintains the phone's slim profile and does not add any bulk to it.The last pro is also a con.

Nice crisp response, and not mushy at all.  I may also try one of the other colors for a more subdued look.  Getting it on was a bit tricky, especially as there were no instructions. I put the rubber on the phone first and then fit the color ring.  To take it off, I just started at a corner and pressed the assembly off.

B00EV8Y684,A3AWPJ1XXZM6XL,dohmez,"[0, 0]","I was looking for a slim case to put my N5 in to preserve that new-like finish as long as possible, but at the same time not add too much bulk. The early availability of this case, low profile design and quality of the marketing of course brought me to this product. This case does feel like a quality case and it came in some pretty premium packaging as well. The case fits very well and looks like it'll protect the device just dandy. There's a small rise in the rim around the glass that protects the glass from sitting directly on a flat surface and with the case on, the camera lens on the back sits recessed inside the case so that it won't rub when the phone sits on it's back (one of the reasons I seeked out a case!). I'm not thrilled about the engraving on the side or back, but that's a first world problem. Personally I would have preferred an incognito look there.The fit around the buttons is just fine and I have no trouble pressing them. The phone is a bit tough to get in and out of the case, but I'm okay with that because it just means it's less likely to fall out of it. The material of the case itself has a similar texture to that of the matte finish on the black Nexus 5 and I definitely enjoy that. I don't particularly care for the two-toned look with the plastic rim around the case. I would have preferred a black trim to match the black on black theme of the device itself, but again first world problems; plus who knows maybe when/if different colors are available, I'll be more inviting to a quick, easy and hopefully cost effective way of customizing the case.Final thoughts, no doubt this is a quality case AND it's more competitively priced than the currently unavailable OEM offering. I would have preferred a more minimalistic touch on the color scheme and not have the branding so visible, but those aren't deal breakers, the details are well implemented and not overly done nevertheless. Lastly, the case DOES add some bulk to it, but hey, it's a big device under there and there's got to be some compromise right?Oh and for the record, I have no issues using this case and wireless charging on my LG WCP-300.",5.0,1383696000,"11 6, 2013","Nexus 5 Case, Spigen Neo Hybrid Series for Nexus 5 - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate (SGP10562)",18.26,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ed62TlPXL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1844},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B00EV8Y684,A3NME3SH3VHQE8,Fadkar,"[211, 242]","**2nd EDIT AT THE END OF THE REVIEW changed from 4 stars to 3.(1st)Edited review:FIRST THINGS FIRST:-When installing and removing this case, DO NOT attempt to separate the plastic bumper from the TPU layer!!! I would strongly suggest Spigen to include a simple instructional guide/pictorial guide showing how to remove the case the right way. The first time around, I ended up bending the plastic bumper around the USB port when attempting to separate the case before taking my phone out. Instead, you should just work the corners of the phone, and pop it out of the case edge by edge. It isn't nearly as difficult or time consuming this way (and you wont end up potentially bending or damaging the case).THE NEXT IMPORTANT THING:-I am very happy with Spigen because they truly care about their customer's satisfaction. There aren't many companies that are willing to do what it takes to keep their customer happy. For that reason, I will ALWAYS buy my cases from Spigen.-After damaging the case, I was very frustrated at Spigen for not including a simple instructional card that showed how to properly/effectively put on and take off the case. I left a negative review and contacted Spigen letting them know that I was unhappy with the product. A couple days later, they contacted me, and today I received a replacement case with a card thanking me for my business and an apology for the inconvenience. What great customer support! I'm extremely satisfied that even a small issue such as a dented bumper is a big deal for Spigen. Thank you.And now, THE REVIEW:Pros:-Very Very slim! The case adds very little size and weight to an already light and thin device.-The TPU material feels great. It doesn't show fingerprints very easily, and has a smooth texture. The smooth texture allows the phone to slip in and out of your pockets easily.-The precise raised lip is crucial! Never ever buy a case without it! It means if you lay your phone face down on a desk or drop your phone face down, the screen will not make contact with the ground/surface. This GREATLY reduces the chance of shattering the phone's screen.-The camera lens is also slightly recessed, so it wont make contact with your desk.-This is the slimmest form factor for a case that I would purchase. Anything bulkier is too much for me, and anything slimmer will sacrifice on shock absorption. I prefer thin cases and this is the perfect size.-The volume/power buttons don't feel mushy.-The camera and speaker cutouts are perfectly sized.-Design wise, the case looks flat, sleek, and simplistic which I personally love.Cons:-Removing the phone from the case can be difficult especially if you try to separate the bumper from the TPU case first. The solution is to pop the phone out from the edges. Spigen can easily avoid this issue by including a simple diagram.-The 3.5mm audio jack cutout is pretty small. I haven't had an issue with the headphones that I haveSony MDR-ZX100 ZX Series Headphones (White)but others may have a problem.-The micro USB cutout seems like it will accommodate most cables without any issues, but anyone that has an oversized cable might have a problem. Personally, I've used 4 different cables and haven't had any problems.-The bumper is made out of plastic. It only feels cheap/flimsy when the phone isn't in the case. Once the phone is in the case, the bumper feels solid and doesn't flex.-This isn't a con but something to keep in mind: If you want to apply a screen protector, I would highly suggest applying it WITH the case on the phone. If your screen protector isn't centered, there will be a risk that the lip of the case will push against the edge of the screen protector causing bubbles.IN CONCLUSION:I would give this case a solid 5/5 if it came with a diagram showing how to put on/remove the case. Other than that, I love the case and I love the dedication and commitment Spigen has for making their customers satisfied. I would highly recommend this case, and don't regret my purchase one bit. I will definitely be buying my future cases from Spigen as well.**Please mark this review helpful if you've found the information to be useful so more people can see the review. Feel free to ask any questions! I'm usually good about answering them:)**EDIT 1/25/2014:I have knocked one star off this case, so now it is at a 3/5 rating. Unfortunately, this case does not hold up to the daily usage very well. Only after a month or two, the back of the case shows blotches of discoloration and scratches. I am very gentle with my phones so I was especially surprised to see that the case looks like I just came back from a war zone!Also, other reviewers have said that taking this case on and off frequently has caused the edges of their nexus 5 to wear out. I haven't experienced this because I have been using other cases along with this one; however, I could see why it can cause wear on the nexus 5 because it does take some pressure to put the case on and take it off...It's something to keep in mind!that's all for now!",3.0,1383955200,"11 9, 2013","Nexus 5 Case, Spigen Neo Hybrid Series for Nexus 5 - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate (SGP10562)",18.26,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ed62TlPXL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1844},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B00EV8Y684,A26P08DCAHSM77,Genryu,"[2, 4]","I bought this case because from the images it seemed to offer a good amount of protection over the back and edges while still looking really nice in its own right. I've put my thoughts below on different criteria for this case.Fit: It fits very securely around the nexus 5 and shows no signs of give once put on securely. It consists of two pieces - a main rubber back that covers most of the device and a 2nd more rigid (but still flexible) outer &#34;ring&#34; to hold the case tightly to the body of the phone itself. I think this system works well, and inspires confidence with a snug secure fit. The only thing that isn't quite so snug are the buttons on either side, with a little bit of looseness on the volume-rocker buttons of the case. Not a deal-breaker, and certainly hasn't at all impacted usability.Protection: It offers very good protection from drops and just every-day usage. I would say that if I dropped this onto a hardwood floor or just outside on the ground - so long as it landed on part of the case I'd expect the phone to be unharmed. The problem is if you drop the phone and it lands on the screen - there's pretty much minimal protection there. The case does offer protection when you place the phone screen facing down on a flat surface by raising the screen up a little. But beyond that you have no real protection. Conveniently, spigen sells glass screen protectors for exactly that reason which should work very nicely. I plan to buy one soon actually.Finish: I just think this is a very classy looking case - and certainly far better looking than the rubber nexus one that google is trying to sell directly through their store as the official case. It just feels like a quality product, and certainly worth the $20 asking price that I bought this at. The one downside is that the backside of the case and just along the edges - its a bit slippery. The Nexus 5 phone comes with a nice soft-touch rubbery finish that feels easy to grip. You definitely don't get any of that with this case. So while the case itself looks and feels nice on its own, it does make the phone a bit harder to get a firm secure grip on for me at least.Verdict: I think this is still the case to beat right now for the Nexus 5. If you too are worried/had a bad experience with dropping your phone or just want something that looks nice and will keep your phone feeling new - the spigen neo hybrid case is one I'd highly recommend. It does have some short-comings, but overall it's still a great case and out of the ones I've seen being sold on amazon is the best one to go with. You have to decide how much protection you want and what size you're willing to go with, but I think the spigen is a great balance of protection and good looks.",4.0,1383782400,"11 7, 2013","Nexus 5 Case, Spigen Neo Hybrid Series for Nexus 5 - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate (SGP10562)",18.26,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ed62TlPXL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1844},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

The Ultra Hybrid has a slight dint in the bottom left corner of the case, which looked like something a made-in-china TPU case would have.As for the Neo Hybrid, the case looked so promising on Amazon's website, but yet was utterly disappointing in real life. Firstly, the polycarbonate rim had multiple slight scratches right out of the box, which looked like it had either been used, or very poor QC was done. Secondly, the buttons are misaligned and so loose they actually popped out when i took off the case to try out the Ultra Hybrid. I have the original LG bumper case for my Nexus 4 and boy, the buttons are miles ahead in terms of rigidity and feel. Thirdly, which is the most shocking part, the process of removing the Neo Hybrid actually opened up the back plate of my Nexus 5! Thankfully, I managed to push the back plate back into the phone.At $19.99, not only does this case comes without a screen protector, unlike the $9.99 Ultra Hybrid, it also feels worse than the cheaper case.

The glas.t fits very nicely with both cases, my friends don't even notice it's on. You do have to take care when installing it to have it fit right. If it's off by even a tiny bit the lip of the cases will start to peel up the edge of the protector. Also, there is just enough of a gap between the case and the protector that lint and dust can build up in an unattractive ring all the way around the screen. Qi charging works with both cases just as well as with the phone naked.I broke my Nexus 4 recently (dropped it without a case on) and was very disappointed by the aesthetics of the Nexus 5, possibly the ugliest product Google or LG have ever made. Enter Spigen. Both of the cases are very stylish and give the phone a much better feeling (not to mention, let it lay flat on a table ...geez LG, what were you thinking!) I prefer the subtle accent color and chrome buttons of the Neo Hybrid case, and don't feel like I'm giving up very much in protection. I'm used to an OtterBox commuter case, and both the Neo Hybrid and the Slim Armor feel more cosmetic than protective. Maybe smartphone case engineering has just advanced enough that we don't need very much bulk around a phone to protect it... I hope I don't find out.I have had no issues with button presses on either case, it seems Spigen has corrected whatever defect was reported in their first run of Nexus 5 cases. I read some complaints in other reviews about the cut-outs for the USB port and headphone jack being too small, I have not found this to be an issue at all for either case.I have alternated between both cases as my daily driver, and am pleased with the look and feel of both.However, I have a very low degree of confidence that either case would protect my phone against anything more than surface scratches.

I don't think it is a deal breaker, I would definitely buy this case again....but it could cause problems if I had really dry hands.  Also, I'm not completely sure of the drop protection. I have read about the air corners and how they disperse impact. I have yet to drop the phone, so I cannot comment on that.  I will say that it feels really good and sturdy in the hand..and that is how i will transition to the Positives of the caseThe Good.  It does feel good in the hand, very solid and well made.  I am not concerned at all about dropping it...I think it  will survive just fine.  All the cutouts are fine, and the buttons on the sides are easy to press.  It takes a little getting used to the fact that they are not raised up at all from the sides.  I was a little concerned about that when I bought the case, but now I really like the feel.  The headphone cut out is quite big and fits all the miniplugs and headphones I have thrown at it.  The lip around the screen is fine, and raised up enough to protect the screen.  All in all, I really like the case...it feels great in the hand and I love the gunmetal color and feel.  To me, it almost looks and feels like real metal.

I used to swear by and only use otterbox cases, but I hated how bulky they were. They always had great protection but I were extremely difficult to slide in and out of pants pockets. The Spigen Heavy Duty and Slim Armor cases still provide the protection that I need and are designed in such a way that they don't add much bulk to the phone. You still need to add a screen protector but I actually like that as it doesn't allow dirt and dust to get under the screen like some cases. This case is a great improvement over the slim armor case I had for my GS4. They have redesigned the buttons so they are easier to use and the plastic part of the case no longer has a thin piece that goes over the button that can break off. Also the rubber isn't so soft that it sticks to stuff, but it still allows for it to have the shock protection needed to keep the phone safe. The only real downside to this case is the cutout for the heart rate scanner is a little steep and doesn't read effectively. This was addressed from the company and the fix is to not press too hard. I was skeptical if it actually worked, but it actually did work that way. Overall it's not a huge issue because it's not something I use all that much.Pros:PriceSizeLooksNo Built-in screen protectorCons:No built-in screen protector ( not really a con)Cutout for heart rate scanner is hard to use.",5.0,1398038400,"04 21, 2014","Galaxy S5 Case, Spigen Tough Armor Case for Galaxy S5 - Retail Packaging - Smooth Black (SGP10761)",18.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41IykYgzbzL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 210},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B00I3UWD40,A2R1J9I6UETYT6,Jason,"[1, 1]","After buying and receiving this case from Amazon, I was simply amazed at how thin the Tough Armor case was. I also own the Spigen Neo Hybrid for the S5, but I simply like the Tough Armor better after trying it out. Allow me to point out the pros and cons of the Tough Armor, compared to the Neo Hybrid.Pros:- Thicker rubber top and bottom gives you greater shock protection and absorption than the Neo Hybrid.- Slightly bigger cutout for the USB charging port, giving you more room to open the port.- Form-fitting, recessed Power and Volume buttons ensure you do not accidentally turn off/on or change volume.- The four back corner guards allow you to lay your S5 flat on a surface without scratching up the back of the case.- Greater lip for your back camera and heart-rate sensor.- The thicker rubber of the case gives your phone even more lip (with and without a tempered glass screen protector) than the Neo Hybrid.Cons:- The rubber part just below the home button is thinner than its counterpart on the Neo Hybrid. The Neo Hybrid's rubber is backed by the polycarbonate frame which provides better resistance and protection for that part of the case.- The case back of the Tough Armor may be easily scratched over time with constant contact (though I will try my best not to ruin it). The rubber back of the Neo Hybrid does not have this issue.Overall, I highly recommend the Tough Armor and the Neo Hybrid cases for your Galaxy S5. Your phone is an investment worth anywhere from $200 to $700 dollars, so it is important you have the best protection possible. Spigen's glass screen protectors and the Tough Armor case is essential to protect your S5.",5.0,1403308800,"06 21, 2014","Galaxy S5 Case, Spigen Tough Armor Case for Galaxy S5 - Retail Packaging - Smooth Black (SGP10761)",18.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41IykYgzbzL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 210},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

They have responded back both by phone and email to all of my concerns.First: the heart rate sensor may be flawed or defective on my phone. I have found that you need to put your finger down and lift up briefly till it starts measuring and than apply your finger back. Also you don't need to apply any real pressure to get a reading doing so will cause it not to get a reading with or without the case.Second: they believe I may have a defective TPU portion in regards to the charging cover. While I don't believe this to be the case I did figure out the charging cover can be opened on the long end with this case.Third: The infrared port is designed to be covered as best as possible for protection which is what the case is providing. Yes you do lose a little bit of flexibility in pointing it with the case but you are getting the added protection.Fourth: Yes it hurts my hands to hold it could it be the way I hold it, absolutely! Should it be taken out on the review of the case, not at all. It's just not my cup of tea but than again I don't like the competing versions of these cases.Lastly I can't fault the case at all on my ""suspicions"" of it causing problems with the microphones, that's just silly.In conclusion this is a fine case made to be durable and protect your phone from being broken. It does all that while looking good to boot. Did Spigen pay me off to fix my review, no. They reached out to me to address my concerns and make sure I was a happy customer. That is something you don't see very often in a company. Did I realize I was being silly in some regards, yes. Like any good reviewer you need to take the case as it is and not for how you may or may not like it. It's not the cases fault I don't like it why should I rate it differently? In the end do I feel like this case does what it's supposed to, yes, thus why it deserves 5 stars.FinEdit: 4/9/14 I finally received the phone today and have changed my rating of this case from a 5 to 2. I should have waited to receive the phone before I submitted my initial review. Yes the case is premium quality and very nice looking however with actual usage it has some problems.First: problem as others have said the heart rate scanner is impossible to use which is due to the thickness and size of the cut out.Second: problem I am surprised no one has mentioned I can't get a fingernail in to open the cover for the charger. I've had to use a knife to get it open with the case on.Third: the infrared on the top needs to be pointed almost dead on to the device you are controlling. With the case off I can point the phone at the ceiling and it will work.Fourth: it almost hurts to hold for any great length of time. This is due to the edges of the case being squared off instead of rounded which would have given a much better feel to it I think. Also the flatness is made worse by it having rough edges to it.Lastly this is not something I have been able to prove but I believe their may be an issue with the microphones being so deeply set in with the case. I will be reaching out to Spigen on my issues tomorrow and I will update this accordingly.Original Review:Not much to say other than that. Retail packaging is even high quality!

For example the corners are rounded and solid to absorb energy in those nasty drops on the edges. The bottom has tiny bumps - barely noticeable - that act as legs to keep it from sliding around on a table or flat surface. And the cutouts for the ports are oversized, so it's easy to open the charging port or insert the jack of your headphones. (I've had cases where I had to trim the opening to get the jack in). There is also a slight overhanging lip on top which will keep the screen elevated if you place it face down.The buttons operate perfectly, the styling of the case is rugged but cool looking and it comes in a variety of colors.

The outer hard-shell portion is more of a frame, or bumper as it were.  It only goes around the outer edge, holding the TPU cover in place and providing polished buttons for power and volume.  The amount of added bulk is minimal, but worth it regardless.  This will definitely be my primary case.  If you're looking for something stylish and functional, while being slim and not adding much bulk, I definitely recommend this one.  The hard part is picking the color for the outer piece.

The UV coated frame provides tough protection around the device, while the rubber-like back of the TPU ensures you have important grip of the phone. In addition, the Neo Hybrid's case back will not be prone to scratch marks. While the Tough Armor series has extra rubber lisps on the back to guard against drops, people have complained about the slippery feel of the case. The Neo Hybrid does not have this problem. In addition, the cutout for the USB charging slot is a bit bigger on the Neo Hybrid than on other Spigen cases.Regardless of which case you use, I highly recommend pairing it with a Spigen tempered glass screen protector (use Glas.t ones if you pair your phone with a case, and Glas.tR ones if you do NOT use a case), to ensure the maximum protection for your phone.",5.0,1401408000,"05 30, 2014","Galaxy S5 Case, Spigen Neo Hybrid Case for Galaxy S5 - Retail Packaging - Satin Silver (SGP10771)",18.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SE9EfnyYL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 348},Spigen,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

I had no issues opening my charging port because of the case. Fingerprint sensor works well, heart rate monitor works as well as to be expected.

The main issue is that I'm comparing it to the Spigen Slim Armor case that someone else has, which I like better, so of course I criticize the one I have.  First world problems I know.The main thing that makes me like it a little less than the Slim Armor is the rubber cushion on the inside of the case instead of the outside.  This means all of the exposed sides are plastic so if you are the type that drops their phone a lot you will certainly scratch it at some point.  Fortunately I hardly ever drop my phone, which is why I can't complain about it too much.  This is the main reason I like the Slim Armor Case a bit better, is because it has rubber on the outside, which gives the impression of being more protective and gives you a nice feel in the hand.

B00I3UWGVA,A3UKPBTB65LLH6,John Anderson,"[0, 0]","This is a pretty case, well made, fits the phone like a glove and I really like the look of it;  Let's face it, it is designed to make your S5 look more like a big iPhone.  Similar metal like case around the outside.Another BIG plus, is that the main on/off sleep/ wake button on the right edge of the phone, built into the case works perfectly.  Adds very little resistance to the pressing action which is great because I use that button a lot.  Molded TPU cases with that button molded into the side of the case add a LOT of resistance so you really have to push the button much harder to get it to work, with those cases on.What I'm not psyched about, is that it makes an already big phone, even bigger.  Of course any case adds to the size of the phone, but this really does.  I had this cover on for a week or two when I first got the phone, got used to it, then took it off and was amazed at how thin, light and svelte this phone is without that case.  Second, because it is in two parts, it is kind of a production to get it on and off, so if I need to change the battery or plug it in to my large car charger and need to remove the case, it adds time to the process.  The outer plastic ring has to fit into a channel in the black silicone part of the case perfectly so you have to spend extra time working it into the groove with your fingers. By comparison, I bought a Tech 21 impact mesh TPU case that, like any molded TPU case, pops on and off in a couple of seconds and offers excellent protection for the phone and adds less bulk than the Spigen case.Without a doubt though, this Spigen case looks fantastic, very classy and is perfectly made.

Since they do, I'm sold on upgrading to an S5...Update 6/24/14: I've had this case on my S5 for a couple months now and had to come back to edit my review. I actually dropped it to a 4 star instead of a 5 star. One major difference between the S5 over the S4 is the charging port has a sealed cover over it for waterproofing reasons. With this case, they didn't leave enough room for me to open the charging cover without either removing the case or using a paperclip or something similar.

Reading the other reviews, I was expecting it to be very slim.  Now, granted, it is slim, but in order to achieve proper protection, it is going to add bulk to your phone.  This adds enough bulk to make the phone a little awkward to operate.  It also adds a fair amount of weight to it.  Occasionally, I will take my phone out of the case, and it's like falling in love with how thin my phone is without the case.The headphone jack I use in my car to hook up to my stereo is a little tight, but it fits.

I believed it was the same which i ordered from amazon but shipped from China. I was not at all impressed by the case. But later , in couple days i receieved this case. This case is totally different then the china one. Though there are lots of similarities but the finishing and details are very obvious. There were some issues with china version. The flap doesnt open as there was not much room for finger, the back dots were very big and it doesnt look good,the camera and flash cuts are too big, speaker cut was  not perfect. Overall all cuts were not perfect. The surrounding bumper was also looked cheap. Overall please buy genuine spigen case to avoid all these frustrations. Genuine one is a clear winner in all details.though little thick but you always had case then its not a matter. I never had my phones in cases.

I was annoyed by the buttons triggering unexpected wake ups and pocket dials. Using this case requires password screen protection to keep unwanted unlocks from happening. I echo others reviewers criticism that the buttons feel cheap to the touch although this did not affect responsiveness. If fact the buttons may do too good a job based on my earlier criticism. I recommend a case with cut-outs for the buttons.
