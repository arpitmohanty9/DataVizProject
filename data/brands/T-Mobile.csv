I told the operator I wanted to transfer my phone number from my existing prepaid account to a new SIM. I'd forgotten my PIN number, but was able to ""prove"" my identity by providing a phone number that I had called in the past week (a bit weak of a security measure, but that's another topic).

B003X7RY06,A3T7BTQBVRJDOH,"Carrie Waterston ""Carrie Waterston""","[1, 1]","(Note:  I edited the review after I used the SIM for a while.  I had initially thought it would connect to 3G but the fact that it won't is noted in the product description.  Sorry about that.)Hey folks, I ordered this SIM card in the hopes of using it at Bonnaroo, a huge music festival held near my hometown every year.  Thousands of people take their AT&T; IPhones to this festival, causing the cell towers to overload so badly they won't work.  I've learned to bring a phone with a prepaid SIM card along for texting my friends to coordinate plans.  So far this one's had its ups and downs...* The card arrived quickly and without incident.  Activating the card was fairly easy.  I was able to do that online using only the card's ID number, the phone number, and my phone's serial number.  However, I couldn't place calls right away because I can't get a signal on it at my house (about ten miles outside downtown Nashville, TN).  It seems to work in downtown Nashville, with the Edge network on my unlocked IPhone 3G.* I was unable to register for an online account in order to manage my minutes or find out details about my rate plan.  As a condition to create the account, T-Mobile sends a text message with a temporary password to your phone and you're required to enter this password.  Since I can't get a signal at all at my home, I'm unable to receive text messages.  I called T-Mobile to ask to have this temporary password emailed instead (I was required to provide an email address and received an email confirming my registration of the SIM card, so I know they have my email address associated with my account.)  However, the account rep insisted they don't have the ability to email me a password.  I wound up grabbing the password the next time I went downtown, but it seems sort of absurd that they can't just email you the darn thing.Upshot:  This is a fairly cheap option if you need a SIM card for a one-off, like a trip to another city.  I was able to get a signal pretty easily near Nashville but it didn't do so well in rural areas.  Also, I couldn't get it to work either at Bonnaroo or at another 50,000 person concert in June, so don't rely on it for that purpose.  But basically you can hear well using T-Mobile, it's easy to change your service plan once you're able to log into your account and I think the price tiers are fairly reasonable.  I'd probably buy this again.",3.0,1307318400,"06 6, 2011",T-Mobile Sim Card Prepaid Kit,2.1,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41izsFGMQXL.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8043},T-Mobile,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'SIM Cards & Tools']]"

I've spent more than an hour on the phone trying to deal with the horrid customer service on different issues, and am now stymied because I can see the field where I should enter the required temporary password that came in the above text message, but I am somehow unable to type anything in that field, despite trying on an iPad and two different Android devices from different manufacturers.  The customer service phone number given in the manual does NOT connect you to the right people, and after slogging through an automated voice recognition system, you are connected to an operator who will connect you to the 4G phone service people, who will then tell you that they do not do hotspots, and send you to another person, who will then transfer you to yet another person, and eventually I find myself on hold long enough that I hang up and start over.  Before each transfer, the CSRs (who very obviously do not have English as their first language) read a lengthy script telling you that they are not the ones to solve your problem and another department does it, but they will transfer you to another department who will immediately solve my problem because my problem is so important to them, and T-Mobile is committed....blah, blah.  Before I abandoned my attempt (after over an hour, most of which was either on hold or listening to CSRs read soothing scripts that had nothing to do with solving my problem, I was interrupting the last CSR as he began his ""I'm going to transfer you...."" and asking, ""Just transfer me!"" and he would begin reading the script again from the beginning each time.  He did not understand what I was asking, and I'm sure he thought I was being a total jerk. After I spent a lengthy period of time on hold, I hung up.  I'm going to cool off for 24 hours, and give one more Boy Scout try at solving my problem.  If I don't succeed quickly, this will go back to Amazon.  From what I've read, it sounds like it will be a nice device if I can just break through the activation process and the ineffective system of customer service.

I waited for the right time on this device, my local Wal-Mart brought the price down by $15.My choices were T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless, Virgin Mobile, or some unknown MVNO that (like Virgin Mobile) uses Sprint towers.  Verizon is the most expensive ($100 device, $60 for 3 gb's, but had best coverage).  Virgin Mobile was close at $90 for the device, with about $30 to $40 a month, but uses WiMax for 4G.  The unknown MVNO cost $75 for the device I believe, and it only receives 3G.  T-Mobile's hotspot cost me $70 with the sale.PlansT-Mobile just released a new plan called Pay In Advance.  It is the same plan as what you could get under their monthly service, except it's now prepaid (you'll need to have a debit card on file, auto renew is a must).  $20 gets 500mb's of up to 4g speeds, anything after that is throttled to 2G.  You can go up to 12.5 gb's of 4G for $80.  When I activated my hotspot, I paid for the $50 5gb plan, which lasts 2 months since Walmart devices were eligible.Speed/CoverageThis device doesn't have LTE.  It uses HSPA+, which I can't complain about.  I live in a rural city and At&t;, T-Mobile & Verizon are the only ones who offer 4g out here.  I get anywhere between 4&8 Mbps down and about 1mbps up on T-Mobile's HSPA+For the most part, I get coverage just about everywhere I go.  Some are as I go to don't even have 3G yet, but it's only a small hit when I go through those places since I go right back into coverage down the road.DeviceThe device is so small that it resembles a compact cell phone, which makes it great for storing in your pocket and forgetting about it.  It does get a little warm, but like another reviewer mentioned, not scorching hot.  I haven't used this device enough to determine battery life, but using it for about an hour or so inside of a building used 1 battery bar out of 4.InternetI am able to get most places without any wait times.  Only one website I went to didn't work on this device, but worked on my home internet.  The ping is usually around 80-ms ping, so I was curious to see if I could play games online.  I played Halo 4 and it didn't lag on me at all.  It did use approximately 90mb's for a 10 minute game though.Overall I'm happy with it and I may even change to an unlimited 2g plan with more than 500mb's of 4g.12/24/2013I've had this device for about 3 months.

On 12/18, about 2 weeks into my plan, I receive an email from T-Mobile stating my auto-enroll had been cancelled.  I contacted them via email, they confused my hotspot for a mobile phone at first, but then later realized it and told me they'd send it upwards to the proper team.  Its been 6 days since that first email and I've heard nothing.  As of the last 2 days in a row, I am unable to sign up for any plan, as nothing shows up under available monthly plans.  I'd hate to pay for another mobile hotspot as these devices aren't cheap.  I paid $70 for this device, AT&T; & Verizon's are $100 a piece.

B00A45D5F8,A3NGLERSW7OTUI,B100,"[5, 5]","This phone has been my daily driver for about 9 monthsPros:1. Battery: Best battery life I've every experienced on a phone. Finally I don't have to worry about my phone dying on me before day's end. It also has the added advantage of a removable battery so when I'm traveling I don't have to worry about the juice when my flight is cancelled or delayed. If it dies I just pop in another battery. It actually has never diet on me yet2. S Pen, S Note and the other Note features are awesome. I can even fill out forms and sign them and email them back on my device, etc. After my experience with these features I can't possibly use a non-Note device ever again. They all don't measure up as far as functionality goes and so this is also bar none the most functional phone I've ever used and I've used a lot of them3. Screen size: Great size. I hardly ever use my tablet now.4. Pocketability: I'm surprised at how easily pocketable it is despite the size. It fits well in my skinny jeans despite he size. This is because this device is also quite thin5. Loudness: the single back speaker is quite loud and clear.6. Speed: Good speed. Probably the fastest phone I've ever used (unless the internal storage drops below ~ 2.5gb then the speed also degrades and it begins to lag - I'll address this under cons)7. TouchWiz: a lot of people bash TouchWiz but I disagree. I agree it could be more aesthetically polished but it's far superior to anything else out there in functionality. The icons, etc may not be the most beautiful but this is easily solved by installing Nova launcher from the play store and you don't have to root / modify your device to make it look the way you want because it runs on Android.8. Very good camera with a lot of features - I like that it can take 20pics in 3 seconds and yet maintain good quality in well lit situations (average night / dark situation quality pictures)Cons:1. Lack of adequate internal storage: This is my biggest issue with this thing. It has only 16gb of internal storage, but apps don't install to SD. You might think 16gb is a lot but I've pretty much run out of storage pretty quickly (and this is without storing pics, music videos or games on the internal storage)- I have 82 apps installed and I can't accommodate anymore because I have to maintain about 2.5 to 3gb of free internal storage otherwise the phone begins to lag and freeze like a spastic (and yes I actually use all the apps installed - some for frequently than others). I find this very annoying. Now, I understand that this may not be an issue for a lot of people who don't use a lot of apps and who eschew storing music, video, games and pictures on the internal storage, but it is for me and a big one at that.2. Poor sunlight legibility: This is also annoying. When standing under direct bright sunlight it's hard to read anything on the screen. My old Galaxy Nexus with Amoled screen had much better sunlight legibility than this phoneStill giving 5 stars despite those two annoying cons because this is simply the overall best phone I've ever owned /used and non other comes anywhere close, not remotely (phones used - Nexus one, Nexus S, Galaxy Nexus, iPhone 5 - one of the worst experiences, Nexus 4, Galaxy S, galaxy SII, Galaxy SIII, Droid DNA - and maybe some others that I can't remember at this time)I certainly very highly recommend this phone or you can wait to see what the Galaxy Note III has to offer in 2 months (since my review is coming so close to the release of the Note III)",5.0,1373587200,"07 12, 2013",Samsung Galaxy Note II 16GB T889 T-Mobile Unlocked Android Cell Phone - Gray,399.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41i35b3Kh9L._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 12859},T-Mobile,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

Folks are quick to point out that the S4 is faster, but one car goes 190 and the other goes 180... for me, that's a wash, especially since all of the speed limit signs are no higher than 70... (think about that analogy).But if you really are concerned with the speeds, CNET has an article about the 5 fastest phones in the world, and the S4 and Note2 are two of the five phones!I dropped it one star because it hasn't updated to the latest Android OS. It's a hair behind what S4 has. I believe Samsung is delaying the update because they want to sell S4's. If they just plunked down the same OS for Note and S3 that S4 has, then the S4 wouldn't stand apart... some of you know what I'm talking about with the iPad 2 and 3.

This review is intended for people on prepaid or for people who buy the phone outright.The current T-Mobile S3 is worth about $300-$350 used.The T-Mobile S4 sells for $500 and is $629 newThe T-Mobile note 2 is $699 new and $400 usedI wanted BANG for my buck.  So the way I look at it, I paid $50 to upgrade from a S3 to a note 2 and this is what I got:4.8"" to a 5.5"" screenStylusQuad coreMuch better battery lifeI love the s4 don't get me wrong, but after playing with it in person, it gets really hot, its much more fragile, and its just plain..  The screen is nice but honestly who reads 3"" from their face anyway?  The note 2 is the perfect resolution and is just more practical.  The only negatives are its a struggle to reach the corner 1 handed.  I can use it one handed its just not as easy as the s3.  Partly due to the weight with an otterbox it tends to slide out of my hand more.Let depreciation work for you and the fact of the matter is that the note 3 is coming out in September and the note 2 can be found for a little over half price.  It is almost as fast as an s4 in real life usage and costs $100 less used.
