B001BVTMZ6,A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,"C. Hill ""CFH""","[0, 0]","This ""Stylus Pen"" is not going to work out well for use on my iTouch. The problem is that the rubber tip is not good for sliding on the touch screen, so it sticks and skips on the surface. It also feels like pressing hard enough to make the sliding work (most of the time) is going to brake the iTouch and, while I'm not sure how much pressure that would require, I'm not going to chance it.

I've used Handspring and Palm PDAs for about 10 years (Visor, m515, Zire 71, Tungsten TX) and just don't like using my chubby fingers for input on the Touch. These rubber-tipped styluses and their foam-tipped cousins don't do the job. The iPhone/Touch screen surface is not designed to work with a stylus. Finding a place to keep the stylus is also a problem. With a PDA, there is a slot for it. For my iPod Touch, there is no slot, so the stylus is in my pocket, not with the Touch. I tried using these styluses for a few days, then gave it up and went back to my pudgy fingers.

B001BVTMZ6,A23GFTVIETX7DS,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[0, 0]","I bought this stylus for my father who was having trouble typing and selecting icons on the iPhone.  He has thick fingers, and he did not have the accuracy he needed -- until I got him this. The rubberized tip keeps the stylus from sliding across the screen.  Yes, it does leave little circles and crescents on the surface; however, they can usually be wiped off, just like fingerprints.  But, hey, he can now use his iPhone without the initial frustration.The stylus feels like one from a PDA:  light, thin, and pretty small.  I found it tiring after a while to grip because of its narrow width.  I could ""flick"" the screen with it, although I much prefer using my finger, and typing on the virtual keypad was easier and more accurate than with a finger (fewer errors - but thank God for Apple's word correction software!). The ""flick"" was slower and slightly more difficult to execute with the stylus, but it was doable.  Still, I much prefer using my finger.  The only thing this cannot do it is the zoom in and zoom out features since that requires two fingers.  This device is designed for those who, for whatever reason, find that they cannot enjoy the iPhone's features without a more accurate tool.  Hint:  Give yourself a couple of weeks of adjusting to the touchscreen before you decide this.  It does take time.Because the iPhone doesn't have any place to store a stylus, you may find yourself misplacing yours.  Once you've tested this and liked it, I recommend buying spares.  It's a great option for those who struggle with the touchscreen; however, for most, including me, using fingertips is better.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",4.0,1260057600,"12 6, 2009","Stylus Pen CLIP for Apple iPhone, iPod Touch (Metal Silver Body, Black Ends)",1.27,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/312HdHZm%2B5L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 63675},Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Stylus Pens']]"

I didn't like that I could not dock it with the case on but that is just nit picky.One day I was sitting on a curb waiting for a taxi to take me to the football game when my phone slid off my lap.  It fell a total of 6-12 inches max.  It landed on the bottom corner and the case just split open.  Either side of it fell off and my phone then landed on the front glass CRACKING THE SCREEN!  After much reading I found that these screens are pretty durable so I assume it was a fluke and must have hit a small pebble just right.  Either way if the case would have done its job right and not fell off my phone would not now be cracked.Luckily the phone works fine just has a large crack which is more of an annoyance and weak spot if any.

It does not have a screen protector -- you'll have to buy that separately if you want one -- but the 1/8 "" or so it adds all around means that the case keeps most objects from touching the phone and screen.I have a friend who bought one of the tough-look rubberized cases for her iPhone, and the second she saw mine, she wanted to know where I got it.

B001CHBNZ6,A2N75ADJSRW0AH,Jeff Kraus,"[68, 69]","This is the kind of case I've been looking for!If you carry your phone in your pocket, don't get one of those soft silicon cases.  I got one for my iPod classic, and it sticks to the walls of the pocket, making it difficult to take out. It gets pretty annoying to have to push your pocket back in after your case turns it inside-out. :PSo for the iPhone, I definitely wanted a hard case.  This was the perfect answer. It's a hard plastic case, but with a matte finish and a really silky feel to it.  The fit is good, and it seems to stay together pretty well.You'll still need to order a screen protector if you're worried about that (I am since the iPhone is the only phone in AT&T;'s lineup that is not eligible for insurance), since there is no screen protection with this case.The sturdiness of it is very comforting, since I have a tendency to unintentionally crush things in my pockets (I commute on a motorcycle, and that kind of thing happens), and while I don't necessarily believe that I would hurt my iPhone, the peace of mind goes a long way. :)Edit 08/08/2008: Added a couple of photos so you can see how it fits on the iPhone 3G.  Also, I'd highly recommend this case combined with this screen protector: Apple iPhone Screen Protector.  When put on right, the outside edges of the protector are 100% covered by the edges of this case, making it impossible to get those rough edges that can happen over time with some of the lesser screen protectors.And now I'm off to review the screen protector. :-)Edit 08/26/2008:  First, a question was asked in the comments on this review - the case in the seller's photo shows one single rectangular hole that exposes the necessary components, while the one that I received (see my customer images) has two separate openings. I purchased mine from this seller, so if I were you I would expect to receive one that looks like the one in my photos rather than the seller photo.  Personally, I like mine better, but that's my own opinion. :)Second, I was sent a message privately asking about the openings on the top front of the case and what they are for. The holes expose three components in total -- the speaker, the light sensor (which varies the brightness of the screen based on ambient light, if you have that option turned on in Settings), and the ""Face Detector"", which is a sensor that turns the phone's screen off during a call when you bring it up to your head, and turns the screen back on when you take it away.----------------Edit 04/14/2009:----------------I'm seeing a lot of really negative reviews lately, and one in particular (dated 04/11/2009) that states that the manufacturer has changed the design since I bought mine (in August 2008).  According to that reviewer, the quality of this new version is inferior to the old one.  So I would advise caution at this point.  I can't speak to the quality of the latest model personally since I have not purchased one, but I would hate to have someone buy this item based upon my review and then be disappointed when the item is not as I described.",5.0,1217894400,"08 5, 2008",iPhone 3G ONLY Rubberized Hard Plastic Case Cover Black,2.01,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31PlkGZbjAL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 89851},Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

The device fits very snug and there is no give in the case except on the right side, there is a gap that is a fraction of a millimeter wide where the front and back attach. It is just enough that I can see it move if I press the front and back together. The other side is perfect. I like how the openings for the buttons are emphasized so that the case comes nearly flush with the controls. I have no trouble hitting the volume or sleep buttons, even when it's in my pocket.Finish5 out of 5 - The choice of material is perfect. It looks like my iPhone is wearing a scuba suit. The case is hard plastic, but the finish does not scratch and does not display any fingerprints or scuffs. It is just soft enough that it offers a little protection as well, but it does not 'catch' in my pocket like a silicone case would. Previous reviewers have described the feel as ""silky"" which is exactly right, it almost feels like an expensive leather case, but, because its molded plastic, the thin sides along the display stay firmly in place and do not 'give' at all.Overall5 out of 5 - I know that I dinged it for the fit, but the price and the overall quality far outweigh this small imperfection. Just buy this, like  right now.

The screen seems to be the same resolution as the original, and the colors seem fine too. The replacement seems to be just a little thicker than the original, which causes the glass to sit above the bezel by a half millimeter or so. It's possible that it was my reassembly ineptitude that caused the screen to sit higher, but I don't think so. One negative: while the kit came with every screwdriver needed and lots of prying/wedging/spudging tools, it didn't come with any adhesive pads to reattach the screen.

B004WIR48W,A26FD4U2SMC52A,ruel,"[0, 0]","The camera lens on the back of my iPhone 4 was scuffed up a bit and the pictures were hazy and not as sharp as they could be. So, bought this replacement camera lens from Amazon marketplace third-party seller WirelessFinest. This replacement is a nice cheap repair fix. One complaint worth mentioning is that inside the lens cover, there were tiny bits of excess plastic where the lens is placed inside the cover. This is probably just a quality control issue where the inside circle of the plastic cover wasn't cleanly cut and left a couple bits sticking out. I would NOT blame the seller for this (but would blame the seller's supplier) because if you don't look too closely at it, you would miss it. However, you know how you are always looking at your iPhone and will eventually notice every little nick on it and would eventually see those annoying tiny bits of plastic around the inside edge of the lens. So, had to trim those out with my pocket knife. Didn't want to do it because didn't want to chance scratching the lens, but that turned out to not be a worry because my pocket knife was not touching the face of the lens. Eventually, the tiny little bits of plastic came out or got smoothed out (don't know which). Used an aerosol can of compressed air to blow out any plastic bit crumbs out of the lens cover. Also used the compressed air to clean out the camera and the led light on the phone as well as to blow out any dust and any other whatnot in the phone. Put a tiny little bit of tape to hold the lens cover in place on the inside back of the back plate of the iPhone. Put it all back together and now the camera pictures are nice and sharp.The other complaint worth mentioning, that others have similarly talked about, is regarding the pentalobe screwdriver that you use to remove those awful two pentalobe screws with the 5-star screw heads at the bottom of the iPhone in order to open up the iPhone to do the repair fix. My replacement camera lens came with two screwdrivers -- the pentalobe screwdriver and the regular phillips screwdriver. Of course, my iPhone needed the pentalobe screwdriver. Unfortunately, it seems like you have maybe two chances to use the low-quality pentalobe screwdriver that came with the replacement camera lens. The first chance is to remove the screws and the second chance is to screw them back in because afterwards the minuscule blades on the tip of the pentalobe screwdriver may have become worn down and stripped. Well, needless to say, my clumsy self in doing this relatively simple repair needed more than two chances, and once those chances ran out, then the pentalobe screwdriver no longer could bite to hold onto the 5-star screw heads of those awful pentalobe screws. Needless to say, those awful pentalobe screws with the 5-star screw heads are staying off and my iPhone is now waiting for acouple of honest-to-goodness phillips screws with the cross-shape screw headsto instead be used. So, it's good riddance to pentalobe screws. And it's thank goodness for the more reliable and easier to handle phillips cross-head screws.",4.0,1339200000,"06 9, 2012",Original Genuine OEM Camera Lens Cover Repair Replace Replacement For Apple iPhone 4 4G 4Th Gen Generation,0.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41bzma6LhwL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 7289},Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

Why, when this is supposed to be a brand new phone, not factory reset, not refurbished?!!!  Also, there is a delay when using the touch screen at times, which leads me to think I have possibly been mislead and that perhaps the phone is not new as it was advertised.  Everything looked new, no scratches, all the right stickers and film in the right places but I am having these issues with the phone.  It is disappointing.  When I slide my fingers to zoom or just scroll the screen, sometimes it doesn't want to.  I keep my phone impeccably clean, using anti-static and cleansing wipes specifically made for electronics.  This should not be occurring.  Now that I have all my data on the phone, I'm reluctant to return it and start all over, although I should.  The inconveniences are minor as long as they don't get worse.  Well, this drops the rating down a star to '3' from '4'.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Well, I was able to set up the phone, sync photos and music onto it and tried a few test calls.  I've also successfully hot spotted the phone's internet to my computer and all seems fine...so far.  In fact, I'm using the phone's internet connected to my notebook right now, writing this review.  I'm more than 3 hours in and the phone is not hot and everything appears to be great.  I've even ordered and downloaded a few MP3's to add to my music library.Hopefully this will last a few years like the previous models I purchased directly form AT&T; corporate.  I know this is old technology. but it works and my last 2 phones were the same model.  When my phone unexpectedly went up a few weeks ago, I was able to put the Sim in an older 3GS handset and keep it moving.  Now that I've ordered and received this one, I have retired the old handset again, just in case I need it, again.I ordered directly from AMAZON, LLC, so that if I had any issues, they'd be more willing to work with me instead of having me deal with a vendor.  Some vendors are top notch but some are not and electronics, even outdated ones, are too expensive to take chances.  It was a big enough risk to order from anyone other than AT&T; directly as far as I'm concerned.I'm glad my experience was a good one and hope it continues to be.",3.0,1400371200,"05 18, 2014",Apple iPhone 3GS 8GB (Black) -(NOT UNLOCKED) AT&amp;T ONLY USA,169.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41UywapRmbL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 9675},Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

B004ZLV50E,AS4CM6IQHKUC6,Cougar Alex,"[1, 7]","For many years the world has longed for a device that would allow them to connect to others such as friends and family, or coworkers via internet while on the go, but weren't able to do so until about 2005 when the iPhone was invented. Throughout the years, the iPhone has been renewed and more efficient with its marvelous usages and captivating features; however, even though the iPhone is very useful for mainly everyone, there are some versions of the cellular device that aren't so great. For example, the iPhone 3GS allows its consumer to surf the web, text, record videos, explore YouTube, capture photos, sync music onto the iPod app, etc., but there are some fallbacks to this device despite the many features. Because of these fallbacks, it would be more convenient for the consumer not to buy the iPhone 3GS in order to avoid frustration, and to just go ahead and buy a slightly more expensive iPhone that allows the consumer to do much more. There's no point in buying a cool gadget that won't stand up to your expectations.When it comes to the iPhone 3GS, consumers expect it to have loads of capacity for their items that they want to store such as: music, contacts, notes, email, pictures, etc. This is not all true because the phone can only support 8 gigabytes meaning there is minimal space when it comes to syncing old stuff onto the new device - there won't be any more room for new stuff. Speaking of minimal space, there are also minimal accessories available for the device that aren't cheap. Since this specific phone isn't as efficient as the iPhone 4, less people are buying the 3GS therefore making the accessories more obsolete. Because the phone is becoming obsolete, there aren't as many choices to choose from when it comes to buying phone cases or other accessories. Phone cases for this phone are very hard to find in a Target or WalMart making the consumer having to buy accessories online, which is an inconvenience, however much cheaper. Not to mention the fact that the iPhone 3GS doesn't have FaceTime, an implanted app on the iPhone 4 that is a convenient way to chat with other iPhone 4 carriers, flash, minimal ways to take pictures, limited space, and the bulkiness of the phone. The 3GS carriers are forced to take pictures one way - the standard way - without flash. They are also not able to face chat with others because there isn't a double screen allowing them to see who they're talking to; the  carrier would either purchase a chatting app and have to face the back of their phone the whole time due to no double screen. The space in the phone runs out quickly making the consumer delete photos, music, or apps to create more space - no one wants make that a habit of. Lastly, the phone is more bulky and round than the other iPhones which makes it harder to find more accessories and phone cases, and even creates an unwanted, large bump in the pocket of the carrier.Because the newer iPhones are coming out with greater a capacity and better efficiency, they are consequently making the older iPhones more obsolete and forgotten. Not that the older iPhones are horrible and cheapy, but they lack the intelligence that the newer ones have attracting less and less of consumers to look at them twice. No one wants a phone with little space for apps and pictures, cloudy, disfigured pictures, phone cases that don't fit, and a fat phone so to speak. With little need to say, there is no competition when it comes to purchasing an iPhone. All of those who have the 3GS are obliged to admit that their phone is a waste of money because it isn't as efficient as the newer iPhones and that they simply need to upgrade. Despite the higher costs, the newer iPhones are much more advanced and convenient for people to use and cause no problems as far as satisfaction. Consequently, new consumers of a smart phone are to be directly appointed to iPhone 4's to avoid all hassles of the older ones.",2.0,1347753600,"09 16, 2012",Apple iPhone 3GS 8GB (Black) -(NOT UNLOCKED) AT&amp;T ONLY USA,169.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41UywapRmbL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 9675},Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

The browser on the Iphone (Safari) is a decent browser but from some reason even with a good signal it just sucks on the iphone, also for some reason it latches itself to whatever wireless wi-fi signal it can get even if you program your settings to only look for certain ones it will still default to a random wi-fi network you cannot connect to and will give you connectivity errors when you launch safari. Even though your on a 3g network that you pay out the backside for from the phone company it will still error out safari or any internet apps until you change the wifi settings back over and over again. I have not found a way to stop it from leeching onto any wifi it can find (yes i changed the setting to disble wifi/programmed which specific wifi spots i want to use) but it still does it. After dropping this phone about a foot from my pocket to the ground on soft gravel the screen cracked, I have never had this happen on any other Ipod/portable device other than my macbook pro which dropped about 2ft rendering the screen useless and caused random light shows etc which bricked the laptop. Also be aware of the protection plans the phone companies have for your Iphone which is nothing. If something burns out within the phone they will fix it, if it gets damaged, screen cracks, falls into water, gets stolen, or any other type of plausible damage you are not covered and have to buy out this piece of junk for another one. Im going to buy out this piece of junk and trade it for a blackberry plan. I think Apple had its time to shine now they are just releasing cheeper makes of thier good products.

B004ZLV50E,A2BX8DDQGCCG2J,MWebb,"[15, 16]","You should be aware that the 3GS was discontinued by Apple when they released the iPhone 5 in September of 2012.You need to read the ads from marketplace vendors and be aware of the various types of ""unlocks"" and what ""new"" means. Not all vendors use these terms the same way (they mostly want you to think it is ""no headaches"" factory unlocked when in fact it may not be).* ""Factory unlocked"" should mean shipped unlocked by Apple itself - after all, Apple is the ""factory"". You should be aware that the ONLY USA-authorized, factory (Apple) unlocked iPhone 3GS was the 8gb model with model number MC637LL/A. If you have a 16gb or 32gb or an 8gb with part number MC640LL/A, they might be CARRIER unlocked, or SOFTWARE unlocked (hacked), but they aren't ""factory"" unlocked. Apple stopped selling factory unlocked, 8gb iPhone 3GS models when they introduced the iPhone 5 in September 2012. The 4 became the new entry-level, factory unlocked iPhone at $450 (Apple had been selling the unlocked 3GS for $375). You might still be able to get Apple refurbished unlocked 3GS's in typical Apple ""new"" condition (albeit factory refurbished).* ""Carrier unlocked"" is not a commonly used term because ""factory unlocked"" is what most buyers want to hear, and if a seller is honest and the phone is carrier unlocked instead of factory unlocked, they will usually just say ""unlocked"" (not say ""factory unlocked""). Unlocked phones (carrier unlocked) do not require ""activation"" and will take any GSM sim (standard size). The operating system can be upgraded to the latest bug-fix or feature enhanced edition without any risk of ""freezing"" or ""re-locking"" your phone.  Carrier unlocked is perfectly legitimate, but usually encountered in used or refurbished phones since AT&T;'s official policy is to only sell ""on contract"" phones that permit unlocking only after the 2 year contract has been paid in full; even then they restrict unlocking to existing and former customers, and you have to put an AT&T; sim in to unlock it. If you are buying a phone that has been carrier unlocked in this fashion, it is usually not technically new (at a minimum) or actually used in retail service (""used""). Some vendors load programs onto their ""new"", ""in box"", ""factory accessoried"" 3GS phones so the customer takes the final step in unlocking the phone, placing it into service only by the customer. Those vendors do not provide step by step instructions on how to activate the phone, but generally you should try putting your non-ATT sim into it and just proceed until you get a message that the phone has been unlocked before proceeding with a factory restore and/or iOS updgrade (your phone, if new, should probably come with 5.0 or 5.1, depending on how long it sat on the shelf). After you get the unlock message, you should do a ""restore"" first, to clean out the OS from junk programs and anything else, then upgrade to iOS 6.0. If you got a legitimately ""carrier unlocked"" phone your phone won't become re-locked to AT&T.;* ""Unlocked"" is an ambiguous term that can mean factory unlocked, carrier unlocked, or, heaven's forbid, jailbroken, depending on the honesty of your vendor. As mentioned above, unless you get a rare Apple online store true ""factory unlocked"" 3GS, it is more likely you will have a ""carrier unlocked"" 3GS, also perfectly valid. A ""software unlocked"" or ""Jailbroken"" phone is a major problem and a misrepresentation (unless the vendor spells out it is jailbroken or software unlocked) - the operating system has been hacked to unlock it from AT&T;, so you have a possibly compromised operating system, and if you upgrade to a newer version of the iOS (which is essential to preserve security) it once again locks itself to AT&T.;  You should not accept an iPhone sold to you as ""unlocked"" if it has been software hacked / jailbroken. Yes, I know that freedom-of-software advocates are in favor of software unlocking to permit wifi hotspotting and non-Apple Store approved Apps, but unless you know what you are getting into - and my point is that you have a RIGHT TO CLEARLY KNOW what you are getting into - a software unlocked iPhone should NOT be sold as ""unlocked.""* ""Software unlocked"" or ""Jail broken"" phones some in two degrees: a software hack has been used to just unlock the phone from AT&T.; The downside here is you can never update the iOS without re-locking the phone to AT&T.; Unless you are an AT&T; customer (existing or former), AT&T; won't unlock the phone. If the phone has been reported as stolen, AT&T; won't unlock the phone. The operating system has been ""exploited"" by a hack that may or may not leave it more vulnerable than a factory or carrier unlocked phone. Jail broken goes one step further - you can buy apps from outside the Apple Store. In other words, additional parts of Apple's operating system have been hacked. There are tons of people walking around with hacked iPhones, but you have a right to know if you are going to be one of them, and if a phone is advertised as unlocked, it should be factory or carrier unlocked - completely safely, no future headaches unlocked.* Finally, there is ""new"" and there is factory warrantied ""new."" No vendor I have seen is willing to assure the buyer that the ""new"" phone will have a warranty honored by Apple, since they are essentially being sold as new in a ""gray"" or ""secondary"" market (carrier overstock, for example). I have heard that Apple will honor the warranty based on when the phone was first placed in service - activated - but there could be problems based on the age of the ""new"" phone. A ""new"" 8gb edition is likely to be chronologically younger than a ""new"" 16gb or 32gb 3GS. Carrier unlocked overstock only becomes problematic because you are probably NOT buying it from an actual AT&T; outlet (company or independent store) but from a generic re-seller - so does Apple count it as being ""placed in service"" when YOU activate it, or when  the generic re-seller purchased it from the authorized phone store? If the path from authorized phone store to gray marketer is quick, this might not be a problem, but keep it in mind. This may also explain why the last step in carrier unlocking is often programmed to take place when we, the ultimate user, buy the phone and begin setting it up, instead of when the generic re-seller purchased it as carrier overstock. Also note that some vendors explicitly state that the serial numbers on the cartons might not match the serial number on the phone, due to their need to program the phone to unlock itself when you activate it (carrier unlock request, a legitimate process not a hack). I find that dodgy. The ""new"" box might have been opened, but there is no reason not to put the phone back in the same box it came with.Now that your head's about you explode and you have decided to suffer under a 2 year contract with AT&T;, or buy a $450 factory unlocked iPhone 4 from Apple, there are actually some good reasons for buying a ""new"" ""unlocked"" 3GS while they are available now for about $200 -+ They are a fine iPhone that will run iOS 6.0. They ran 5.1 fine, and my first ""new"" ""unlocked"" 3GS is humming along and making my daughter happy running 6.0. When you are going to give the phone to a kid, saving more than 50% for a slightly dated (but far from obsolete) iPhone is great. She can check Facebook, send messages, check email, browse, using the (presently slow but soon to be upgraded) T-Mobile ""Walmart"" plan for only $30 a month. That's incredibly cheap compared to any AT&T; plan, and even cheaper than the $45 Straight Talk plan. So I save money both on initial purchase price and on monthly fee. If I wanted unlimited talk, text, and messaging, I can get then under the Walmart family plan from T-Mobile for only $50 per month (post paid, so more with taxes though!) or from Straight Talk, which buys their time from AT&T; so you have AT&T; quality at prepaid, $45 per month bargain rates (note that T-Mobile currently only delivers 2G speeds but will be up to 3G speeds by the end of the year or early next year, as they ""re-farm"" frequencies to bring them inline with iPhone capabilities, while Straight Talk uses AT&T; so you get 4g speeds RIGHT NOW - but only 3g on the hardware limited 3GS phone).+ I like the look and feel of the iPhone 3GS - the curves - more than the 4, 4s, or 5.+ Battery life is good.- + Screen is NOT Retina - so I won't be reading books on my forthcoming replacement 3GS (the one I ordered for me) BUT I carry an iPod Touch for that - it lets me conserve my phone battery to have separate devices.- There is no front facing camera, so no FaceTime, but on my wife's 4s FaceTime is herky-jerky anyway so once the novelty wears off, the actual functionality is not good anyway.+ I like the ""lower mugger profile"" of the 3Gs compared to a 4, 4s, or 5 - you can rate each of the iPhones yourself on the urban crime, muggability index of your choice. The 3GS gets the job done without attracting undue attention, esp. overseas for me where it provides slightly less, but more than adequate performance - and let's face it, in Asia the bandwidth isn't always that great, so you are balancing bandwidth delays against operating system/hardware delays anyway.+- The camera is autofocus with a flash, and 3 megapixels beats the .7 megapixel (less than 1 megapixel!) of my iPod Touch any day of the week. If you want pro-level pix, you need the iPhone 5. (The 4 has 5 megapixels, the 4s and 5 have 8 megapixels).I recommend against a used unit. I bought a used unit last year. It was jailbroken, so couldn't be updated from 5.0 to 5.1 without paying another software unlock fee, and it was completely linted up at the earphone - clean glass and back, but obviously used hard, even for its ""like new"" rating (the like new applied to cosmetics not extent of use). For the small difference in money, ""new"" right now, during this brief window when retails outlets are dumping their overstock, is much better imho. The other alternative would be a refurb from Apple, unlocked obviously, or a factory unlocked 4.Finally, my primary personal phone stateside is a Google Galaxy Nexus running Android 4.1; I sold my first ""used"" 3GS to an overseas friend, bought a second, ""new"" 3GS for my daughter here last month(the Android system gives her headaches); and the my third foray into iPhones from Amazon is another ""new"" 3GS from Tablet Distributors (Fulfilled by Amazon). (The first ""new"" ""unlocked"" 3GS from Tablet Distributors did not unlock successfully so I am returning it for another).",5.0,1349827200,"10 10, 2012",Apple iPhone 3GS 8GB (Black) -(NOT UNLOCKED) AT&amp;T ONLY USA,169.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41UywapRmbL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 9675},Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

Still, the organization and tactile feel prevented me from switching over to an iPhone or Droid, not to mention the high cost of obtaining a data plan, though I had been following Apple's technological progress since the early 2000s.Nevertheless, once the iPhone 4 was revealed, and some final convincing from a relative, I made the switch, and I, like millions of consumer, can gladly say I never will look back.(Though I quickly will mention that I still miss the tactile feel of physical keyboards.)Because I have made it a habit to be technologically and gadget savvy, I already knew how to navigate through an iPhone, and had a long list of apps I wanted to download. Since I didn't own any of the phones before, I can't compare them hardware-wise, but software-wise we all can agree that Apple takes a few steps forward, but makes a couple bumps along the way.The first big feature to grace the iOS upgrade for me was the Notifications. I realize that many had been clamoring for this, and it was a welcome addition when it was released, but over time it has become quite cumbersome to manage with the different security settings Apple has included.I still use the iPhone 4 to this day, though mostly as a workout companion. It has a noticeable weight compared to my iPhone 5, yet I actually prefer it as it feels sturdier in my palm. And since I'm used to the iPhone 5 now, the iPhone 4 seems to perform a lot slower than before, especially with iOS 7, and the battery drains faster now, but it still manages to load all the apps designed for iOS 7. Not bad for a three-year-old phone.While I certainly like the iPhone 5 and its ability to store an extra line of apps, I prefer the squatter iPhone 4 for its size. It's easier in the hand, and it feels more portable as it takes up less room in my pocket.iPhones are nice to have, but I'm seriously considering a Droid next. Apple's products just aren't up to some of the competitors' capabilities in terms of gaming and customization. I love video games, and the iPhone has some amazing software, but their limitations only serve as a downgrade.Still, for the general public, I'd say Apple is the way to go.",5.0,1386547200,"12 9, 2013",Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - AT&amp;T,269.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41eVAfYDANL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1960},Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

B004ZLV5PE,A96K1ZGW56S2I,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","I have never owned a smart phone before, but most of my friends own iPhones. Last May, after becoming a bit more financial stable, I made my first smart phone purchase and bought an iPhone 4.I am relatively new to cell phones in general (I&#8217;ve only owned a cell phone for five years), so purchasing a smart phone was a big deal for me. Although I know the benefits that come from owning a smart phone, I wasn&#8217;t sure at the time if I was making the right purchase. I like the physical feel of a QWERTY keyboard. I don&#8217;t download a ton of data. Compared to most of my peers, I don&#8217;t even text that much. Despite this, I have been pleased with my iPhone 4.The basic apps that come with the phone are easy to use. Software updates can be set to download automatically or manually.Security is a major concern and you can change the settings to make your phone secure or as open as you would like.I hardly ever downloaded anything with my old phone (it wasn&#8217;t a smart phone anyway), but I have noticed a huge advantage in the speed of whenever I do download something on my iPhone 4.I love the camera functions of the phone. I had a camera on my old phone, but the difference in pixels is extraordinary. Not only that, but I can take extended videos, too.Physically, the phone is of a design that is pleasing to the eye and the phone is extremely lightweight. With that said, I highly recommend getting some sort of real protection for the phone (such as an Otterbox or Lifeproof) because although this is a great phone, it is not at all durable and the glass can easily crack or completely break if it&#8217;s dropped on a hard surface.My only major complaint about the iPhone 4 (and all Apple products in general) is that it does not include an operating manual. Sure it comes with a little pamphlet about how to turn the phone on and off and what buttons to use, but that&#8217;s not a manual. That&#8217;s a mini-instruction guide and nothing more; it has no real knowledge of how to actually use your phone, for instance, it doesn&#8217;t tell you how to download apps, how to open the apps already included, what apps are included, etc. I have never understood the concept of selling an electronic device, but not including a manual about how to operate it. Apple is terrible with this (as is Adobe in the world of software-they never include manuals for anything either). You do a major disservice to your customers when you don&#8217;t include a manual. As much as I have liked the few Apple products I have owned, they will always be a step below of what they could be for not having a manual.In general, I am very pleased with the iPhone 4. It&#8217;s been a good cell phone for me so far and if you can deal with not having a manual, I recommend it for someone looking to purchase a smart phone for the first time.",4.0,1389657600,"01 14, 2014",Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - AT&amp;T,269.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41eVAfYDANL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1960},Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

It does not get 4GLTE so it is slower and personally, I think the camera sucks.  So if you want a FREE phone, I would still say pay extra to get a later generation because eventually, this will be too slow to handle new apps.I noticed that Amazon will buy back the three different models almost reflects the difference for ordering a new phone from Verizon with a new 2 year contract e.g. if the 4 is free with new contract, the best offer from Verizon is $125 and so if the 5 is $200 from Verizon, then the best offer from Amazon is $335.  The iphones still have better resale value than other smartphones although all are in the $200 range for the newest phones.

B004ZLV5UE,A2UP33DO8OLOJ5,Joshua B. Brackin,"[3, 4]","I purchased my Verizon iPhone 4 the day that it launched. I wasn't expecting any surprises considering that Verizon released it well after the AT&T; launch. In this regard I was correct. My model shipped with IOS 4.0 installed and that was very fun. The feature that makes this phone great compared to the competition is the Operating System. IOS is the best system available for a smart phone. I've owned 3 Android Phones and 3 iPhones. The iPhone is definitely the best of the bunch and I don't expect that I will be going back to a Droid anytime soon. The build quality of the iPhone 4 is superb. The glass resists scratches and the iPhone 4 has glass on both the back and front (compared to previous iPhone models and the iPod Touch). This leaves it very resistant to scratches. All of my Android Phones scratched easily.The iPhone 4 is weak in a few areas. The volume isn't as loud as it was on my Android phones (especially the Droid Incredible). I would rate the actual sound quality as high and the volume as average. The Wireless is hit-and-miss at best. Apple used the same Broadcom wireless module that is found in the iPad and iPod Touch. This module is a very low-power device which translates into low range. It's not uncommon for the iPhone to struggle with picking up Networks that other devices can see easily. The iPhone 4 lacks a SD Card Slot and thus cannot be upgraded. The Battery is also built-in and will have to be replaced by Apple if it fails. The iPhone relies on iTunes for syncing media which can be a pain if you're not a big iTunes user. The Camera takes amazing pictures... as long as the subject isn't moving. There is a noticeable delay in taking motion pictures. The Video Quality however is fantastic.Overall the Verizon iPhone 4 is a great addition to the Apple Library and deserves 4 stars. It does have a few downsides, but the enjoyment that you will get out of it will make you forget them.

B004ZLV5UE,A3HNJRHXIFN97X,William,"[16, 19]","The Apple iPhone 4 is one of Verizon's best all around smartphones.  While it no longer sets the pace in the smartphone realm, the iPhone 4 does an adequate job of handling nearly all basic smartphone tasks and offers well rounded performance; which is all that many smartphone users really want from their device.  While it is not for everyone, and no device is, the iPhone 4 is a solid device and is definitely worth a look for non-power smartphone users.1. Design.1. The compact and svelte design of the iPhone 4 is refreshing, as the smartphone ecosystem continues to evolve from ""brick"" to ""cinder block"" sized phones.  It is slim and pocketable, and the side keys are arranged in an intuitive manner.  Volume keys and the power button (which doubles as a screen lock) are very tactile, and the ring/vibrate toggle on the top left side of the phone is a great addition.  While the phone's physical appearance is subject to personal taste, i'd wager few would find the phone unattractive.  I have the white version of the phone, and find it much more vibrant and visibly appealing than the more unassuming black version, though some may find the white to be too loud on the eyes.2. Despite the phone's relatively small size compared to other smartphones, there's a bit too much wasted space on the front of the phone for my liking.  While the screen is clear and bright (there is no pixelation whatsoever due to the 960x640 resolution), it's a tad small when considering the width and length of the device.  In fairness, problems due to the screen's size are more a product of the operating system and not the physical dimensions of the screen, but the OS also has no relation to empty space on the phone's front face.3. Both the front and rear facing camera's are flush with the phone's design, which is a big plus.  Apple also hit the correct layout for the charging/data port and the 3.5 mm headset jack; the former is located on the bottom of the phone, while the latter is at the top.  Several phones i've used (feature and smart, and from almost every manufacturer) had the headset port on the bottom, which is fine if you like to hold your phone upside down all the time, and also featured charging ports in the middle of the left or right side of the phone.  If Apple changes anything about the physical design of the next iPhone, these two items should not up for discussion.4. One thing that should be up for discussion however, is the back of the phone: it is made out of glass.  Many iPhone 4 users lament this, but Steve Jobs didn't amass a fortune by mistake.  The more people that drop the phone and break the glass on the back, the more money Apple makes.  It's a design flaw, even if it was intentional.Performance1. Calls: I tested the iPhone 4 on Verizon's network in a variety of locations across Louisiana.  Call quality has been very good; I have not encountered any dropouts or conversational blips during any call.  Callers do not sound overly warm through the earpiece, but they do not sound robotic either.  Callers also sounded good through the included headset and on three different bluetooth headsets I tried, but speakerphone quality was abysmal at best.  The speakerphone is not loud enough and suffers from ""the wax paper effect.""2. Reception: the iPhone 4 gets above average reception on Verizon's network; like many Verizon phones, I generally have 3-4 bars nearly everywhere I travel.  It rarely has full signal but I haven't dropped below two bars either.3. Battery Life: the battery will take you through a day of heavy usage and two days of light usage.  Phone calls use surprisingly little power, and I only lose 2-3% of juice while the phone is on standby during the night.4. Data Speeds: While this varies from location to location, I find that the iPhone 4 isn't as quick in this regard as other phone's i've used, particularly Blackberry and Android devices.  Depending on the location, I generally get about 10-20% slower speeds on average with the iPhone 4.  In fairness, I've observed the same with my fiancee's iPhone 4 on At&t;, so it's not a carrier issue.  Regardless, I haven't had any problems loading large webpages, streaming audio and video, and moving files.  In the two areas I spend the most of my time in, my download speeds range from 0.6 to 1.4 MB, and my upload from 0.5 to 0.8 MB, which is normal for many Verizon phones in many locations.  With that being said, it is clear that Verizon's 3G network is slowly clogging up, which i'm hoping the influx of 4G upgrades and devices will address.  Despite these notations, Verizon's 3G network is far more consistent in terms of speed and connection than other carriers in the area. My fiancee's iPhone 4 on At&t; ranges anywhere from 150 KB to 3 MB down and 50 KB to 1 MB up, and even though At&t; theoretically has a faster 3G network than Verizon, my data connection seems far more reliable.Features:1. Operating System: After using several smartphones with different operating systems, i've concluded they are all more or less the same with a few differences here and there: tap an icon on the screen and go.  Up front, I don't find the iPhone 4's OS any easier or harder to use than Android, RIM, WebOS, and Windows Phone 7, and I also don't buy into the idea that iOS is simpler and easier to use than those offered by its competitors.  There are a few differences here and there; Android offers widgets, Blackberry offers a few home screen icons and a drop down menu, and Apple offers...a convoluted mess of icons and programs with little rhyme or reason.  It's simple to use, but that does not mean it is always pleasant.  A drop down menu would do wonders for this OS.  Personally, I miss the widgets than Android and Windows Mobile offer, but I understand Apple cannot become too much like its competitors (well, maybe not until OS 5).  However, there is little organization going on when you first fire up the screen.Where iOS really begins to look like every other OS is when you delve deeper into the menu.  Again, there is little rhyme or reason to how anything is arranged, and for a couple of weeks until you memorize where every option is located, it can be a frustrating experience.  My favorite example was browser settings; you cannot access them from the browser, but only from the overall settings menu itself.  Is this any better or worse than other OS?  No.  Is it any easier though?  Well, no again.A final side note: iOS does not require ""babysitting"" and constant attention like Android does in order to get your battery through the day.  I know rooting solves many of Android's babysitting issues, but a lot of people have jobs, families, and other hobbies that make rooting an unnecessary annoyance.  While I personally like Android OS better for the customization it offers, the entire babysitting/rooting issue is a turn off to some, and I myself don't miss them either (even though I never had a problem rooting an Android device).2. Business functions: Apple does not have the business reputation of RIM or even Android yet, but nothing from my usage suggests it is inferior to either OS in this regard.  Push e-mail works like a charm, Exchange works as it should, and Office files along with PDF's open and render as they should.  I am not a power business user and cannot offer comment on such, but the iPhone 4 gets the basics down in this category.3. Multimedia: This is a big of a mixed bag for me.  The iPhone's 4 camera is one of the best i've ever used on a smartphone; both the rear and front facing.  Though the rear camera is only 5MP, images are clear, sharp, and beautiful as long as there is adequate light.  Night shots with flash were less than stellar, which should surprise no one with a smartphone.  The front facing camera is only 1.3 MP, but still takes images with little distortion.  Beyond this, i'm not blown away with the iPhone 4's multimedia capabilities.  iTunes integrates files nicely with the phone, but i'm not sold that Apple's ecosystem is any better than dragging and dropping.  The iPod is perhaps the most underwhelming feature on the phone; I find it no different or more impressive than any other smartphone music player on any other device.  And the speakerphone performed no more impressively for music and video playback than it did for voice calls; multimedia audio sounded waxed over and washed out on the speaker. The AppStore will only impress those migrating from RIM, WM7, and WebOS.  But one thing I've noticed about using applications on the iPhone 4 is that they don't seem to crash nearly as often as they do on Android and Blackberry, and in fact, I don't think i've had even a handful of them in a month's usage.  And the lack of Flash does not seem to be a hindrance on the phone's multimedia capabilities; QuickTime handles things well, and the YouTube app helps too.  Again, multimedia is a mixed bag on the iPhone 4, but that's more a knock on the hype the device receives rather than the device itself.Conclusion:Other than subtle differences in the OS, the iPhone 4 offers the same similar features that many other smartphones offer.  It does a good job of handling core functions and basic business needs, and its multimedia package is somewhat overblown, yet still more than adequate.  If your looking for a mid sized smartphone that requires little maintenance and don't need LTE services, the iPhone 4 is definitely worth a look.  For the price however, it offers few features that stand apart from any of the other top smartphones in Verizon's lineup.",4.0,1310169600,"07 9, 2011",Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - CDMA Verizon,178.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41eVAfYDANL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 505},Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"

B005SSAXSI,A28SBPF6KFZ7VL,Eric K.,"[3, 6]","Let me begin by saying that setting up the iPhone initially is a nightmare that can take -- literally -- days.  I can't even imagine how horrifying it would be for someone who isn't familiar with network connections, programming issues, etc.  There's this connection, that connection, linking it up to iTunes on a computer, contacting Sprint to resolve issues, contacting Sprint again to resolve more (or the same) issues.  I had better luck with reception in the 1970s with a sheet of tinfoil and a TV antenna.  I've had the phone for over a week, and I'm still contacting Sprint to resolve set-up issues.The iPhone activated in stages.  An hour after ""activating"" it online (and connecting it to iTunes), the phone part started to work so I could make outgoing calls.  Two hours later, the Internet kicked in.  Three hours later, texting became available.  Why it's not ""plug and play"" baffles my mind in today's fast-paced, instantaneous world.Then came issues with the phone calls and texts.  We finally discovered that it was because the Airave that Sprint sent us because we have poor Sprint reception at our house (in a heavily populated neighborhood) wasn't/isn't compatible with the iPhone.  It ""hiccups.""  Phone calls go straight to voicemail.  Texts won't send out.  Multiple same texts come in.  Over and over and over again.  After reading up online about other people's similar problems and contacting Sprint over and over again, we finally just unplugged the Airave.  It was the lesser of two evils.Another problem that arose was that when sending texts to email accounts, they showed up as picture mail, regardless of a picture being attached or not.  Several chats with Sprint later, there's still no resolution.  We've given up on that.  Similarly, when sending these ""texts"" to email accounts, the email address shown was a randomly generated email address based on the first person's name of the shared family plan.  That became confusing when the person sending the text wasn't the first person on the plan.  Two hours of chatting with Sprint, that was finally resolved.  (You can't manually change it online yourself for whatever reason.)The actual iPhone itself is fun to use.  The apps available are numerous, and you have to hunt and peck to find out which ones appeal most to you, download them, arrange them, and learn how to use them.The sound on voice calls isn't as good as my last non-smart Samsung phone, but I'm getting used to it.With my old phone, I could charge it every three days or so.  With the iPhone, I have to charge -- at the minimum -- nightly.  It drains energy/power faster than a half-working air conditioner in NYC in the middle of summer.  And this is just casually using it during the day, not heavily.  I also practice steps to reduce the power usage: toning down the screen brightness, closing all apps after use, etc.  I recommend getting multiple charging adapters -- for home, work, and car.  But make sure to only charge them fully when they're close to being out of power.I went with the iPhone 4S vs. the iPhone 4 mainly for Siri.  I thought that would be a great addition/concept, especially while driving.  Unfortunately, Siri has a mind of her own and only wants to work when she wants to work.  I'm constantly getting, ""I'm sorry, but I cannot take requests at this time.  Please try again later.""  Isn't the main purpose of asking things of Siri because you need that information RIGHT NOW?  Like directions?  Or to remind you of something later because you'll forget?  In those cases, ""trying again later"" isn't feasible.  My advice is to NOT get the 4S for Siri alone.  Get it for other features/reasons.  Otherwise, stick with the very similar 4 and save yourself a hundred bucks or so.Do I recommend it?  Maybe.  Once you get over the huge hurdles of set-up, it can be fun to use, and the features are nice to have at your fingertips.  I don't have any comparisons to other smartphones, though, so I can't say whether the iPhone is better than others or not.  Sometimes I wonder if it's better to go back to having one device to use as a phone (that's small and actually works) and one to use as a computer, though.",3.0,1335830400,"05 1, 2012",Apple iPhone 4S 16GB (Black) - AT&amp;T,340.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41eVAfYDANL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1466},Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

B005SSAXSI,A2Y7BSQG9V3LNG,James M. Bailey,"[2, 3]","Beware of Apple 4s phones.  We have had a lot of problems with my wife's phone and its replacement.  Read on if you like to hear of my experiences with Apple customer service.My wife purchased this phone and it worked okay until I installed a wireless system in my home.  My Galaxy III had no problems finding the network (nor any problems, I highly recommend it), nor did any of my computers.  However, her phone would not see the network.  We chatted with Apple support numerous times to no avail.  Finally, they said they would send a placement phone, a refurbished one (Beware of such phones).  Also, I had to guarantee we would return the old phone with a $450 charge to my credit card.The refurbished phone finally arrived and on the third day it would not power on.  However, when placed on a charger it would work but would not charge past 30%.  Again, after several phones calls they decided that this phone was defective.  The tech person said he would have a brand new phone sent and seem surprised that I was not excited over this.  The original phone was less than 9 months old.  However, he could not authorize this and I would have to wait another day for another person to phone to set up the delivery.This person phoned the next day and also seemed surprised that I was not delighted in the fact they would be sending me a new phone.  She explained in 4 to 5 days I would receive the new phone and would again charge my credit card until they received the old phone.  When I complained about some compensation for my trouble with their defective products she seemed surprised that anyone would ask such a thing of Apple.  She made a vague offer of some inexpensive accessory.So we are currently without a phone unless it is plugged into a charger.BTW, from my recent experience you will find all of the Apple people rather sickening in their ""sweetness"" and use of phases like ""have a perfect day"" or ""that is just perfect of you"".",1.0,1357948800,"01 12, 2013",Apple iPhone 4S 16GB (Black) - AT&amp;T,340.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41eVAfYDANL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1466},Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

You can tether with the Apple iPhone 4s.For a very long time I wanted an iPhone as I already have a Gen 1 iPad and an Apple MacBook Pro. You can tell I love Apple products as once you have them all you can easily interface between each product. For example if I want to make up a grocery list on my MacBook Pro using Notes I can do this and the grocery list will be seamlessly sent to all three devices.I also love Siri.

B005SSAXSI,A2SHSPUC68H34G,Tony L.,"[2, 2]","I purchased my first iPhone 4s in February 2012. Now that you can get the iPhone 4 for free with a two-year contract, it's worth giving this little workhorse another look.Only two years ago, this phone had the fastest processor on any smart device. While the competition ( including three new iPhones from Apple) have better overall specs, the 4s is no slouch. Performance is still snappy even running Apple's latest version of iOS 7. Frame rates are consistently smooth when swiping between home pages and opening apps. And first party apps like Siri and Maps run without a hitch.Next to the competition, the screen on the 4s seems to get smaller everyday, but the quality of that screen, in terms of dots per inch and color reproduction, hasn't given up much ground. The same goes for the camera, which arguably produces better results than flagship phones such as the HTC One, and can still easily replace most point-and-shoot cameras.And for most people, the reason why they buy a phone is to make calls. To that end, the iPhone 4s does not disappoint. Calls are crisp. Simple, but often overlooked tasks, such as visual voicemail, or copy and paste between contacts, text messages, and dialer functions is taken for granted by iOS users, but still refreshing for Android users, where these features feel much more half-baked.The biggest and most obvious feature you'll miss out on with the 4s is the screen size. While it works great for basic tasks such as making calls, looking up directions, or playing music, it's not nearly as comfortable as a go-to device for browsing the web, reading books, or watching video.That said, the iPhone 4s is still a world class-device that shouldn't be overlooked. At just over two years old (and despite what marketers would have you believe), it does a fantastic job doing the things you need it to do, like taking calls, snapping pictures, and delivering on the promise to put the Internet in your pocket. What's more, you can get it for free, which makes a compelling case for which phone gives you the most bang for your buck.",4.0,1386201600,"12 5, 2013",Apple iPhone 4S 16GB (Black) - AT&amp;T,340.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41eVAfYDANL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1466},Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

I have yet to find an app that will easily put contacts in groups with their associated business or profession. In example, lets say you were referred to a doctor by your GP a number of years back, one of many and you can't remember his name. With the older smart phones you would just pull down the classified group list and select medical and you would have a list doctors with what you specified as their specialty. The current smart phones don't have that kind of ability to create classifications. So you have to scroll through your entire contact list and select each person with a Dr in front of his name (oh and you better remember the doctors first name to because that's how it list everyone and every thing--from the ""First Name"" line!), then select one, read the note regarding their field of work (over and over until you find the doctor your looking for). I have looked at many apps to try and find one as good as the stock contact list that my old palm treo had and so far there's only one. But it's way over complex for what should be a simple task.Apple's ""Note"" on the IPhone has the same problems. Once again I did find an app that would do, but it's ability to create and classify the notes requires a lot more effort then the palm stock program called Memo.I would go back to using my old Palm Treo but it's been dropped one to many times and now it resets it's self 3 or 4 times a day and I loose the reminders that I have yet to deal with. I choose the IPhone 4S over the Android phone because of their reputation for only allowing apps to be sold after their tested and approval by Apple. After looking for the above mentioned apps I noticed quit a few apps with bug fixes and low customer ratings. So much for that reputation. Another reason I choose apple is because of the customer raves about SIRI. I thought that would work better for voice dialing. Not so. SIRI has some strange problems. It will recognize and repeat what I say and then say it cant find it in my contacts list. Then it instead goes off looking for it online and comes back with other businesses with the same name but it won't be the business I'm looking for. And even though SIRI knows where I'm located by stating that the business is 49 mile from my current location. I may be only 2 miles from the business I'm trying to call. I contacted Apple about this and was told their aware of this problem. So, so much for that plus. I'd return the phone and get a blackberry but with their stock plunging do to their lack of going with the flow of current smart phones I would just end up in the same boat. The problem here is that the smart phone business that once was primarily for business users has now become one of the latest rage of the average public user who the mfg.s think only cares about using the phones for games, video entertainment, and texting. So even though it would be easy to incorporate the features I am missing from my palm the mfg.s just go with the flow and so does the market.",2.0,1351209600,"10 26, 2012",Apple iPhone 4S 16GB Black - FACTORY UNLOCKED,359.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K53V96YNL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1468},Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

B0074R0Z3O,A19EMVPAAW44OP,,"[5, 7]","*Update*iOS 7.0.4 has made this iPhone 4 act like my old Motorola Droid X, which means it's giving me a head ache.  It doesn't do want I want it to do.  I have to jailbreak it to make it work normally again... once I jailbreak it though.iOS 7.0.4I CAN'T TURN OFF ANYTHING ANY MORE!I can't upload music into this phone anymore via iTunes. When I TRY, it leaves my phone hanging on ""waiting for changes to...""I can't sync it to iCloud without having a pop-up message telling me to put in my password to an individual email account.I can't go to the app store and download an app without telling me it can't download and install the app at this time. The only way to do this is go back to the app store in my phone and RE-DOWNLOAD the same app.I can't restore everything from the iCloud when I do a ""factory reset"" AKA ""Erase All Content and Settings"" like before.When I need to take a quick photo of something, there is now a pause for my phone to open it on.I have to constantly turn off background apps even though they're not truly on. They basically require another load as if you're loading them for the first time.*Before iOS7Apple will take advantage for your phone's free hard drive space to download the latest firmware update without your knowledge. It will take up space until you allow for the change. Until then, you're out of luck with your free space.Never trusting Apple again. I'm jumping back to Android. This is ridiculous.*Original Review before iOS 7*I decided to jump off the Android wagon when I was having a hard time with my Droid X and another Droid Motorola makes.  Though I enjoyed its use, the problems with it was too much to ignore. Bad Wifi connection, the constant lag/freezing/auto-reboot, and camera problems were just so annoying.  So I got this and was surprised, since both the Droid X and iPhone 4 came out the same time.Wifi:The iPhone 4 had better Wifi connection and speeds.  I did a test run on both at the same time using the same router and same app, and notice that the Droid X was much slower.  Also, the Droid X stop downloading after a short time versus the iPhone 4, where I could finish a whole movie from Netflix without any connection issues.  The Droid X would show that it's connected, but nothing would be downloading.Battery:The battery life about the same.  But, since I've only had the iPhone 4 for a month now, I hope it last longer than the Droid X where it barely lasted 2 hours of use.  The good part for the Droid is that the battery could be replaced easily.Both phones seems to have crash issues for me.  But apps crashed less on the iPhone 4 than on the Droid X.Notification:The annoying thing about the iPhone 4 versus the Droid X is the notifications.  If you get a call or message, you have to turn on the iPhone's screen to see.  You could have it blink the flash behind the iPhone to go on and off when someone sends a message or calls, but it only happens in a short time and then the only way to know if someone sent you message or called you is turning the screen on.  On my Droid X, a blinking light on the top would tell me if I missed a message, call, and if the battery was low.  And on the notification bar on the Droid X was much better.  It told more info on what was being notified, and you can easily erase the messages.  On the iPhone 4, the notification bar was basically bleak on information, and an annoying red dot with numbers would appear on the apps.  The only way to erase the red dot is going into that app.  Sometimes, it still wouldn't erase the problem.Customization:I guess I was spoiled after going from an Android to an iPhone.  Unless you jailbreak the iPhone 4, you're not getting much.  The looks is boring.  It's basically the app draw on an Android.  At least the Droid X had some short-cut widgets that was available than having to go to the settings menu and it's sub-menus to do what you want.  On the Droid X, I could turn on and off the wifi, rotation, sound, airplane mode, etc.  I never thought it would be missed until I got my iPhone 4.  GIF and videos can't be live wallpaper nor the phone can't automatically change backgrounds by itself like it did on the Droid.Size:Like the customization, I miss the bigger screen.  Playing games on the iPhone 4 is so much better, but enjoying all of the games on iTunes is limited... for me.  Also, using the GPS is hilarious on the small screen than on the Droid X.  I've been using NavFree which lets me download maps and has an actual GPS that works.  I've never had a problem with it though some people are asking too much for a free app that can work without any data.  The only problem is the traffic, which doesn't show unless you pay for it.Firmware:Hate it on the iPhone 4.  It takes too much space and it constantly reminds me to update.  It even download's itself on to my iPhone 4 with out my permission.  At least, it doesn't install by it's self.Camera:iPhone 4 had a better camera.  The pictures and videos were a bit more better than on the Droid X.  Though the pictures and videos look better on the iPhone 4's retina screen, I had to see it off the phone to really see the difference.  And I didn't see that much of a big deal.  The video file was much smoother from the iPhone 4(not talking about how it looks in the phone).  Pictures wise, they were both okay unless the pictures was taken on a sunny day or in low-light.  Those two situations, the iPhone 4's camera created better pics and videos.  But indoors and on regular lighting, they both were somewhat the same.Multitask:Droid X wins.  Again, if I ""jailbreak"" the iPhone, it would be much different, but the stock version is okay.  Yes, you can play a radio app in the background while doing something else that doesn't require sound like surfing the browser.  But to turn off apps playing in the background, you'll have to delete each and every app one at a time.  Yes the Droid X does that as well, but there is at least a several task managers in the Google Play app store to delete the tasks and cache easily.  I have yet to see anything on the iTunes store.  I did see it available on Cydia, but again, I'd need to jailbreak my iPhone 4 to be able to get an all in one task/cache clear.I do like my new iPhone 4 though.  A lot more accessories are available.  I can count on using the camera when I needed it... even on the lock screen.  It's solid phone I hope it last like my iPod Touch 2nd gen.  I say it cause I still use it and it hasn't fail me at doing what it's meant to do.

B0074R14TI,A3I04RM049YS8Y,Jeffrey Stanley,"[0, 1]","I have used this phone on the Sprint network for the past 21 months.Twenty-one months of frustration with Sprint service is enough. I am very excited that I can fire Sprint in three short months.Ten months ago I bought an iPad mini from Verizon. I carry both devices. I frequently get messages on the iPad ten minutes before the iPhone. Sprint's data service is so spotty, even text messages and voice mail are delayed. It can often be longer, but a ten minute delay is typical (visual voice mail and Apple messaging).I can never rely on having a solid data connection. When traveling in rural areas, data is impossible to find. In many of the same areas, I get strong 4G or 3G on the Verizon iPad. Owning both devices clearly illustrates how inept the Sprint network really is. Even in a metro with 500,000 people, I frequently am forced to find a wifi hot spot in order to use the web to get data or files for my work if I don't carry the iPad.Sprint is weak in cities, and useless in rural areas and small towns. I travel frequently for business and I regret my Sprint purchase daily. Unlimited data is not a value if you cannot access it.The 4S is a good device. If you are considering the 4S, I definitely don't recommend it on Sprint. I would trade my iPhone on Sprint in a heartbeat for the klunkiest phone n Verizon because the phone is crippled by the Sprint network. If you are considering the 4S on a different network, I highly recommend spending a bit more for a 4G device. 4G networks are ten times faster, even on reliable networks. A positive smartphone experience is dependent on good data service.In 2013, the 4S is beyond obsolete because of the 3G data service. A 3G-data iPhone 4S on Sprint is so crippled that I would only recommend it if the person has constant wifi access. If you do have constant wifi access, an iPod touch is all you need.

My 3GS would have probably been dead.As for cons: I have two, but I usually just listen to music on my headphones or stereo, so I'm not going to take it off rating, but I did want to mention it. First was the wireless syncing, I had ICLOUD installed on my last iPhone and when i went to wireless sync my songs and such back, only about 40 percent of my stuff will actually play. It will either skip to the next song, or just pause itself. I fixed that by restoring it on the phone itself, and then hooking it into the computer. It has worked fine with my prev. Iphone so that may be something that needs to be worked out so that you can do that without errors. I'm not the only one to experience this issue. I've seen it before on other websites.The second con, deals with the sound quality. This may just be me, but it sounds a little bit more muffled than the 3GS during playing music on iPod. But overall I'm happy that I got this phone. I don't think that it will disappoint at all, I know people that own this and have no regrets or issues. I definitely consider this a big jump from the 3GS speed-wise, but I've heard and my friend that had a 4, didn't really notice any changes, but siri.Another con that I JUST noticed is that after updating to the 5.0.1 update, sometimes my camera doesn't open. I have to restart the phone to sometimes get the camera lens to open, I don't know if this means my camera is going out or what? But it does that once and awhile. Also sometimes the song volume bar freezes, but I can hit the side keys for that anyway. I really don't have any other complaints, and I feel strongly, the ones I just added are software related, and the next update SHOULD fix that.",4.0,1404604800,"07 6, 2014",Apple iPhone 4S 16GB (Black) - Sprint,298.72,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41eVAfYDANL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 5154},Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

This Apple iPhone 4S is my first, and I feel like I've rocketed to the future.WHAT I LIKEIt was a toss-up between the 4 and 4S. I'm so glad I picked 4S. I love Siri. She can dial my numbers for me. She knows who Mom, Dad, and husband are. I tell her to set my alarm and she does it. I let her remind me to do something when I leave and she never forgets. She is a wonderful friend. Voice recognition is not perfect, but it's pretty good for simple tasks.I especially love the camera. I take a photo and a copy goes straight to my PC. I don't have to think about it. I have a Pogoplug, and it sends photos straight to that, also.My calendar and email addresses also automatically sync. Wow. I didn't know that until I opened them up and found them all populated.WHAT COULD BE IMPROVEDI don't think typing on the screen is easy. While setting up my iPhone, I had lots of complicated passwords to enter. For that, I used a Motorola Bluetooth keyboard, which I highly recommend. For entering events and typing emails, I sometimes use the voice software and go back to correct errors.3G is very slow. I have to say, I'm already looking forward to my next phone two years from now, when it will likely be 4G. I'm making do with WI-Fi, which works wonderfully.

B0074R1IP8,A3NG7X4APIV649,Sam I Am,"[128, 138]","The iPhone 4 (regardless of your cell phone carrier) works best if it has a case. There was some issue with the iPhone 4 and the quality of the internal cell phone antenna. Without the case, I drop from full reception to only one bar. I had the same exact issues when I owned an unlocked iPhone 4 which I used with T-Mobile. So I highly recommend also purchasing an external case, to protect your phone as well as improve the cell phone signal.Definitely you need to understand what you're buying. This iPhone will not work on any wireless carrier other than Verizon. You can't take this phone and switch over to AT&T; or T-Mobile service, because they use a different cell phone technology than Verizon. A lot of the unhappy user reviews posted on Amazon for this product suggest to me that in many cases, the buyer just didn't understand what they were purchasing.Another problem may be with the prefilled Amazon product description. This is not technically an ""unlocked phone."" An unlocked iPhone is one that will work on different cell phone carriers, so some people may have bought the phone relying on the word ""unlocked,"" which is completly inaccurate and misleading. This phone will only work on the Verizon network.There's no SIM card slot on the  Verizon iPhone, and by design, there's no memory card slot either. You'll have to live with the 8 GB (actually closer to 6 GB) of space available on the phone. I've kept my iPod for listening to music - my primary reason for buying this iPhone 4 was so I could use it as a phone.My final suggestion is this: anyone who buys this iPhone from Amazon should not wait to activate it with Verizon. Even if you've bought it as a gift, don't wait to make sure the phone works, because on the off-chance the phone was reported lost or stolen and deactivated by Verizon(a ""bad ESN""), you will need to get in contact with Amazon right away so you can send the phone back for a refund. This is one of the advantages of buying directly from Amazon - you might pay more money but at least, if you buy from them (and not from one of their third-party sellers), you have Amazon customer service to watch your back. Just make sure you're buying the iPhone on a sale page that says ""fulfilled by Amazon.""

B0074R1PI8,A1S2M6SA4OAUNK,Perry,"[16, 21]","For years I've heard how great the iPhone is and with every iteration people seem to echo this sentiment.  So, I decided this time around I was going to try it out and see if it would satisfy the high expectations that my previous smartphones had built up.Honestly, I believe there's no easy way to review the iPhone without breaking it into two pieces as the Software and Hardware deserve equal consideration and I feel they help to balance the weaknesses of this phone.I will say, this phone does have some major failings in the Software so if you're just looking to find out how this is different from your current Smartphone then skip to that section.HARDWAREBUILD QUALITYThe iPhone 4s Feels Solid, it isn't likely to come apart on its own and overall feels very solid.  The only area I would consider a weakness is in the choice of Glass used for the display so the phone is very well done over all.SCREENFor the past couple of years the iPhone 4/s had a pixel density advantage over pretty much every phone on the market and the screen featured the best viewing angles from any screen that isn't using Amoled Technology.  Well, not improving the screen size, resolution or technology used in the display has left the iPhone above average but no longer is it the best in any area.With Smartphone screens running Amoled technology viewing angles, black level, contrast and color had already left IPS Technology behind and if that wasn't bad enough all the latest Android Smartphones feature a HD 720P displays using various technology.Of course even the construction of the iPhone 4s Screen leaves something to be desired as many other Smartphone manufacturers have been using Gorilla Glass for a few years now and the glass is proving to be much more resistant to scratching or breaking; Sadly, Apple decided to go with a more traditional glass that is prone to shattering and this wouldn't be so bad but, it has been glued to the actual LCD since the iPhone 4 debuted.  Basically, this makes for a fairly pricey repair and the situation could be improved with Gorilla Glass.Overall, the screen is a top 5 Screen in that it does enough to rank 2nd or 3rd best in many categories that you view the screen but it really isn't in the running for the top spot anymore and Apple really blew their big advantage here by not updating the screen as well.SOUND HARDWAREAgain, this is a very deep area to review and stating it is good, doesn't do it justice!  You see, Apple has used Cirrus Logic Chips for a few years now and while previous Android phones used to use the same technology, they've all gotten away from them for a reason that we can only assume are supply problems (Apple likes to buy up all the chips in advance to give themselves and advantage).Cirrus Logics DSP Chips are honestly known as the best available for Noise Canceling in phones and honestly, there really is no better phone on the market for eliminating background noise while making a phone call.  It is so good that it can be frustrating when you're trying to play something for somebody on the other end of the phone.Sound output for music and movies is decent but could be better and that's something I'll go into later on in the software section.Overall, the Audio is very good and voice quality is top notch!CPUApple uses their proprietary ARM based A5 CPU which is a dual core 800 MHz CPU (it is listed as 1 GHz but speed tests show it is actually under clocked for  battery purposes no doubt). The A5 is a top 5 performer easily and could be the best CPU on the market but not many tests have tested just the CPU so we'll just leave it as being one of the best on the market.GPUTo beef up the power of the phone Apple went with a dual core SGX543MP2 GPU from the folks that brought us the Graphics Technology behind the Nintendo 64.Nothing more needs to be said other than noting this is the best GPU on the market and there's nothing even close to it!  Most expected nVidia to compete but sadly, this puppy is top notch and it shows in the graphics it is capable of pushing!  We're talking console quality gaming graphics.ANTENNA / COMMUNICATIONSObviously, this was a sore spot with the iPhone 4 and it was arguably the biggest ding Apple has ever taken to their reputation.  Well, it is safe to say that attenuation is normal from the 4s Antenna and I personally have not seen any dropped calls as a result of hand position.Overall the signal is decent, not the best but not the worst either.  Of course the biggest issue here is the lack of LTE and I'm not going to lie, this is a problem if you want to use bandwidth intensive applications.Overall, I wouldn't even say the iPhone 4s is in the top 10 for its Communications Hardware as it was intentionally handicapped by Apple.CAMERASThe 4s features both a front and rear camera with the front being a modest camera used mostly for self portraits, video conferencing, or making a short video of yourself.  The rear camera is used for Portraits and video but can also be used for videoconferencing.The front camera is on par with most and doesn't set itself apart.  The rear camera is a top 2 camera with a backlit sensor, wide aperture and low noise considering the sensor size.The 4s, along with the HTC Rezound and HTC Titan, have set the bar very high for Cell Phone Cameras!  The 4s is better at Video with the Titan and Rezound being better with still image capture.  Overall, like I said, it is a top 2 camera on the market and honestly, this is the biggest reason why I decided to try the phone.  While the Competition has zero shutter lag, the iPhone 4s Camera has significant Shutter Lag!BATTERYThe 4s has gotten a lot of press regarding battery life and this really has the potential to be on par with the Antenna issue given the fact that the phone doesn't feature a user replaceable battery.For me, I will say I was disappointed with the Battery when I first got the phone as it many phones using LTE 4G Communications Equipment were getting as good or better battery life.  Of course, after shutting off a bunch of the background processes and location services as well as tweaking the screen timeout and notifications, the battery life was similar to middle of the road 3G Android devices.  So, it is serviceable at best.Bottom line with the battery, it isn't even close to best considering it has a top of the line GPU and Dual Core CPU in the phone and you cannot just pop an Extended batter in it because you cannot replace it!HARDWARE SCORE = 4.0 based heavily on CPU and GPUSOFTWAREiOS was somewhat revolutionary 4 years ago and it is the platform that Apple has chosen to build around.  Whether that's good or bad, depends on what you're looking for.EASE OF USEiOS is similar to that of Windows 3.x in that its basic structure consists of applications, folders and a desktop.  With iOS there's no menu / app draw for accessing applications as they're all right there on the desktop or in folders (each folder can hold a max of 16 items).  Other than these things you have a task manager, search screen, Android Style Notification bar and a unified Settings Panel.iOS is very easy to use and if you can't figure it out, then you should be rocking a flip phone because Smartphones clearly are not your thing.SOFTWARE FEATURESThe 4s has several features built in that are pretty standard among Smartphones and some of these are below average offerings while others are above average.  I'm just going to hit on a few of these that you're likely to use in everyday life.Music PlayerIs a sub par music player.  Yes it features typical playlists, artist, album and song profiles as well as a few EQ Presets.  Where it fails is in implementation.You see, the EQ is actually placed under the Unified Settings Panel and it pretty much locks you into setting one preset if you haven't taken the time to embed presets into your songs, using iTunes on your PC or Mac.  Also, if you've created any custom presets on the Computer, there's no way to sync them with the iPhone and if you've applied those custom presets to your music the phone shuts off the EQ all together!  This is a huge drawback to me and I find it hugely unacceptable.The iPhone is a branch of the iPod line and neither of these can store the EQ presets which is a really poor design flaw when you consider that the whole line started out as Music Players!  HTC recently bought Beats Audio and as that technology matures it is going to create a lot of problems for the future of the iPhone.SiriSiri is Voice Control / Voice Recognition on Steroids and while it can be awesome, we have to remember there are side effects when using Steroids!With Siri, She flakes out at times and just doesn't work at other times!  Now, this is an issue because at no point in time did Apple ever list Siri as a Beta Product when producing their TV Commercials and yet if you visit their site, you find out that Siri is in fact a Beta Implementation of the Software.Honestly, Speaktoit is more mature and less flakey!  Plus, it runs on every modern Android phone (without Jailbreaking / rooting) and not just a single model.iMessageThis is a good concept for integrated messages but it has one fatal flaw!iMessage is basically a unified messaging app for IM and Text messages.  What it does well is seamlessly switch between text messaging and IM as your network connection goes from WiFi to 3G.  What it doesn't do well is Group Messaging, you see if you send a text to multiple parties that works like you expect.  However, iMessage actually passes on those other numbers to the recipients so that any replies go to everybody!  This is a GAPING Security Hole and I'm surprised more people aren't making a huge fuss out of it!Yes, HTC has this group messaging as well but they warn you and let you shut it off!SafariThis is a typical browser and honestly, it can work very well as many pages were created just for Mobile Safari.  The only failures I've seen are where it refuses to redirect to the desktop version of pages when you click on and instead reloads the mobile version but this doesn't happen that often.Overall, Safari is up there with Dolphin HD and Android's Browser for top mobile browsers.CameraFor A Camera as good as the hardware is on this phone, Apple did a huge disservice with the Software.  They basically made it a point and shoot camera with very few settings and this means the image you get is going to be hit or miss depending on the lighting.When comparing Camera Software with likes of the HTC Rezound and HTC Titan, the iPhone is now and has always been woefully inadequate!  You see, HTC gives you control over ISO and White Balance as well as Scene Modes for different types of conditions and they also give you every other setting that the iPhone 4s offers.  This is why the 4s will never have a higher rated camera than other smartphones with hardware on par with Apples offerings.With that said, the lack of control is evident again in the video camera portion and it is behind the Rezound in that the Rezound has 2x Slow Motion Recording.  However, the iPhone 4s Metering is seamless and easily changes without so much as an obvious shift in lighting during recording; this is the best video camera metering in a phone period!Map SoftwareiOS features very accurate mapping as the backend is based on Google Maps.  It will find locations, give you a list of directions and pretty much works okay in this area.  Where this fails is the fact that the iPhone has no turn by turn navigation.  There are apps that will do this for you but, Apple doesn't allow you to make them the default App so they never fully integrate into the phone.Face TimeThis is just a standard video chat app that does what it is supposed to do very well.  It's really a bright spot for Apple because it leaves them with an application that is standard across all of their modern devices and there's no hassle making it work.This is one area that is above average as the competition requires that all participants go get the app, create an account and honestly they often have compatibility issues with the phones they're trying to run it on.  The only exception is Skype which is cross platform but it still requires people to go get the App and Register with the service.KeyboardWith the iPhone you pretty much get the Apple keyboard, take it or leave it.  It is a solid basic offering that isn't going to wow you in any way.Honestly, I find the keyboard a bit cramped and I often found myself hitting the back space key when trying to push M or hitting A when trying to push S.  Crud, not only can you change the keyboard on the competing devices, they all seem to have universal emoticon support. On iOS you have to install the Emoji Keyboard just to get Emoticons to which they don't work with any other device but the Apple devices unless they find an Emoji plug-in for some random Application!Spell CheckingWhat iOS does is more a Spell Confirmation as it waits until you get near the end of the word to show you most suggestions and even then it seldom shows you more than one suggestion.This is way behind the Competitors as they feature a row of options and this honestly speeds up typing as you're able to often tap your words to select them within a few key strokes.SOFTWARE SCORE = 2.0BOTTOM LINEApple Created a very powerful phone with some very good hardware choices but they dumbed it down with extremely poor software choices!

B0074RE1Z2,A1HHL3WQC1OZ6Z,electronicnut,"[14, 15]","I bought this phone for my wife a few months ago since I felt that she needed to get on the smartphone bandwagon.  She was using an older Samsung Reality with the physical keyboard.  She was just a basic phone and text kind of gal, so I thought about the best phone that would ease her into the ""smartphone world"".I feel the Android OS does need a little more time to get used to with all the widgets and configuration on how you want your apps to display.  There is also an occasional freeze on the older Android OS such as gingerbread and froyo (not so much with ICS and jelly bean though)  The iPhone OS, however, is more simplified for a novice because it has a predefined layout that every user would see and no widgets (I had a feeling that she was going to hold down on the screen too long and delete or move something and wonder what happened to it)  So I thought this was a perfect choice for her.My wife was surprised by the change.  She loved the crisp, clean retina display, the beautiful images it took, and the overall ease of using the phone.  I even showed her that she could now text in a different language, which she never thought was possible with a phone.  She learned how to use the phone quickly, used apps such as Kakao Talk to talk to friends from Korea.  The phone has Siri, but she never uses it.  Although she loves the phone, she only had one complaint...the Sprint 3G network.She complained the 3G was too slow to even browse the internet or watch the occasional Youtube video when she is on the go.  I let her know that the 3G network on Sprint is not good in our area and possibly other areas as well.  I told her hopefully when her contract is up, we could switch carriers or if 4G LTE ever comes available, we could opt for a new phone. Sprint has unlimited data, but the speeds are pretty terrible at the 3G level.So to sum it up, the Apple iPhone 4S is great a phone.  The phone on the Sprint 3G network in my area is slow.  Sprint 3G speeds may be better in your area, but I read on Sprint message boards that people are mentioning the slowness as well.  So something to keep in mind if your shopping for the iPhone 4S for this carrier.",4.0,1362787200,"03 9, 2013",Apple iPhone 4S 16GB (White) - Sprint,319.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ua5HiV45L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 6547},Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

B0074REBX4,A3K1WA708UGOSE,"Hedwall ""hedwall""","[3, 5]","The bottom line is that I disliked this phone so much that I returned it!  I know you're not supposed to say that about Apple products, but read on to see why I think people are largely &#34;drinking the Koolaid&#34; on the iPhone.The Bad:  When I first wanted a smartphone I got a very cheap Droid, which was hard to sync between the Mac home computer I use and my Google email accounts.  Eventually I got it working, but I anticipated that the almighty iPhone would be seamless right out of the box.  It wasn't -- with the iPhone I had all the same troubles going back to the Google accounts that I had had with the Droid going to the Apple products the first time around.  Not fun.I also didn't like that there is NO app available to back SMS text messages up to your Gmail or other email account the way there is for Android phones (SMS Backup+).  In the event of a phone change, and god forbid you do not want another iProduct, you will lose all of those conversations.I couldn't organize the screens the way I wanted them.I missed having my contacts' pictures show up next to text messages and in my phone address book.  (It's the little things, but still!)The &#34;back&#34; menus will probably frustrate former Droid users, as sometimes you have to use the actual butto at the bottom of the phone to go back to the Home screen, but sometimes you want the real &#34;back&#34; button on the screen which is usually (but not always) located at the top.  This is counterintuitive and annoying.The Good:  The camera worked well, the screen was beautiful and the sound was good.  Size is great compared to the other expensive Android models which are a bit like holding an entire computer up to your head.  Also, there are no rights issues with older iTunes purchases which I have yet to resolve on my new Android.The Verdict:  Overall I was disappointed in the operating system I think largely because the iPhone is supposed to be the gold standard among smartphones and I had heard wonderful, glowing things from so many people who LOOOOVE their iPhones.  However, naysayers come out of the woodwork once they realize that they will have a sympathetic ear in someone who isn't subscribing blindly to the iUniverse, and there are a fair number of people who prefer the Droids.  To me the final factor may be how computer-savvy you are going in, and how much time you want to put into learning about your phone and all the different service providers and programs that will, in theory at least, work together to get it to do what you want it to do.  If you're willing to take the time, you might eventually prefer an Android.  If not, the iPhone is definitely not as simple as I thought it would be but I would still recommend it for anyone who doesn't have the technological know-how or desire to play detective in order to get things set up.I will add that when combined with trying to find the right cellular service provider (Verizon has NONEXISTANT customer service and everything requires several phone calls as well as hours on hold to get anything done, AT&T; has less signal strength in my area and I couldn't get usable data to with T-Mobile through Straight Talk), buying a new phone and a smartphone in particular has been one of THE most frustrating experiences of my life.  Once I get my current phone working (a Samsung Galaxy S3), I plan to keep it forever and to never, ever, ever make any changes to my &#34;system&#34; again!

Previously I owned a Motorola Droid Bionic and within the first month, the onscreen keyboard stopped working so I traded that in for an iPhone 4S. I chose the white one and was very pleased with it except for the consistently slow 3G speeds. That is the only problem I've had with Apple's iPhone 4S. I traded in my 4S about 3 months ago for this stupid Droid Razr and I have to say it's like night and day. Ever since the upgrade to ICS on the Razr, the network is noticeably bogged down, slow and my keyboard doesn't function properly once again! I am saving up right now to purchase another iPhone 4S. I would so much rather have that phone than this crappy Android. I'm serious. If you're an Android fan, you should consider switching. iOS is so much more fun and easier to use than ICS.

I purchased a white 16GB iPhone 4S & I'm loving it!! I was going between the iPhone 5 & the 4S, I talked to several people who knew the iPhone well, basically I was told that by updating the 4S which I did, it's basically the same as the 5, I just don't get the 4G speeds, which honestly I don't feel I need. I even took my 4S back to Verizon to exchange for the 5 & the salesperson talked me out of it! I figure when my time comes to upgrade, the iPhone available then will be amazing!

I got the home button, clearly from China, in a crappy destroyed looking plastic bag.  It works, but its a pretty flimsy junky spare part.One point on installation.  Of course you have to unscrew and take apart your phone.  I actually kind of enjoy doing that, but there is one step that I absolutely do not enjoy...heating the glue under the screen and peeling the screen off of the frame.  Its doable, but it sucks to do.  You will literally have to take your entire phone apart to install this button and no tools are provided with this particular button.  My advice would be if you don't have tools to take apart an iPhone, then buy a button that comes with tools and have your blow drier handy when you begin the installation.

The ears of millions of people who wouldn't upgrade anyway are in for a treat, but if you're comfortable with over-the-ear or in-canal style those headphones, those styles will block more outside noise.  These aren't the most detailed or cleanest sounding earphones either, but for a set of earbuds, they are grand, and a good deal at $29.Review -Gizmodo just ran a hit piece on the EarPods, labelling them crap and not worth $29.  Almost every other tech site to review them has been impressed, so I let my curiosity lead me to my local Apple Store and grabbed a set.  My bundled Apple earbuds had broken months ago and I have a number of other headphones in various styles handy for comparison.My immediate first impression of the EarPods was on a voice call that was still in progress when I got to the Apple Store and checked out.  Caller's voice was clear and she heard me well over the din of the store.  This functionality has always been a highlight of the bundled Apple 'phones, even if sound quality wasn't so great.I queued up ""Busy Bodies"" by Elvis Costello and the first thing I thought was ""yuk!""  Treble was sharp and painful.  Bass is there and much improved from the previous earbuds - in fact, this is probably the best element of the EarPods sound.  This is NOT Beats by Dre levels of bass emphasis.  I have Skullcandy Titans in my bag also - those headphones have lots of bass and require a bass reducer EQ.  These EarPods have excellent, well balanced bass.Moved on to ""Lucky"" by the Gaslight Anthem.  Same impression - too much happening up top to enjoy the music.  It seems like the aiming of the driver does improve how much noise you hear from outside, but you will still want to be careful not to turn these up too high.Joni Mitchell, Big Boi, Guided by Voices, I tried a lot of different stuff and decided these needed the treble reducer EQ engaged.  With the treble dialed down, these are a much more listenable headphone.  Cymbals are much more natural and the whole presentation benefits.The do stay in my ears better and they are very comfortable.  Time will tell on durability, but they seem solid.  I think these are an excellent freebie and an OK aftermarket purchase.  I'll update this review if I encounter any problems with durability.  I think I'll switch to these as my everyday headphones - at work and commuting, you need to hear around you.All told, a solid update.",4.0,1347926400,"09 18, 2012",Apple EarPods with Remote and Mic,17.59,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21tMVjCzYNL._SY300_.jpg,,Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Wired Headsets']]"

The controls are still a bit to high and feel rather awkward, but the headphones still look new. I do recommend getting a case for them, like this one:Cosmos Black bluetooth handsfree headset HARD EVA Case - Clamshell/MESH Style with Zipper Enclosure, Inner Pocket, and Durable Exterior for Aliph Jawbone 2, Aliph Jawbone Prime, Jabra BT804+ Cosmos cable tieits a few bucks to protect your investment.I'll admit. I was skeptical of the claims that these were on par with the best headphones out there. I'm no audio fanatic, but I have tested Bose, Audio Technica and Beats. I opened the package and tried to fit them in my ears. At first, they didn't want to stay. Just fiddle around with them, they fit me pretty well now. As for the audio quality, I can honestly say I have no complaints, other than I played a custom mix with tons of bass, and It wasn't pleasant. So to sum up my audio experience, excellent other that the fact that I had too much bass on one song, but hey, might just be me.Pros--Very high quality, crisp and clear sound- New wax(ish) cable, much more durable- Pretty comfortable fit, wore them for about 3 hours at a time- Inexpensive for what you get- You get to be snazzy with a new apple product :)Cons -- A little too much bass for me ( I don't like much)- Had to fiddle with them so they fit right-Controls placement seems a little to high, seems awkward to use it.Over all, I highly recommend these for anybody looking for a inexpensive but very nice sounding headphones.As I said, just comment if you have any questions",5.0,1351036800,"10 24, 2012",Apple EarPods with Remote and Mic,17.59,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21tMVjCzYNL._SY300_.jpg,,Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Wired Headsets']]"

They came packaged in a 2 1/2"" x 2 1/2"" plastic case with an Apple logo on the bottom. It looked very ""Apple.""The EarPods look and work exactly like my old ones - except these have volume buttons and a control button for pause/play and advance.I'm very happy with my purchase.Original review...I received a pair of Apple EarPods with the iPod Touch 5th gen I purchased September 2012. On those EarPods there is no microphone or buttons. They have worked well all 22 months, and I use them daily for between 1 and 5 hours each day. Finally the wires at the plug end of the cable are beginning to lose contact so I came here looking for a new pair.I was pleased to find these Apple OEM EarPods for only $17 (shipped) including the microphone and buttons. I expected to pay $29. I realize, from other user reviews, that the buttons won't work on my Samsung Galaxy S3 which is no big deal to me.Certainly the fit is dependent on ear shape. I do think Apple did their best to design a shape that will work well for the majority of purchasers. In my case they are very comfortable. I don't get tired of using them even after hours of use. They sound great but my most common use by far is not music so the sound quality isn't so critical.I must have 10 or more earbuds in the drawer. They all sit unused. I only wear the EarPods. I'm not an Apple fanboy. I did switch from Apple to Samsung/Android. But I give Apple credit for doing a good job of designing the EarPods. One thing I really like is there is nothing that can come apart - no silicone covers or such.My only concern at this point is I have not received this order yet. I hope what I receive are new Apple OEM EarPods and not some knockoff or refurbished pair. A few reviews have indicated they did not receive new Apple EarPods.I  I will tweak this review when I receive the EarPods.I highly recommend Apple EarPods.",5.0,1404432000,"07 4, 2014",Apple EarPods with Remote and Mic,17.59,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21tMVjCzYNL._SY300_.jpg,,Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Wired Headsets']]"

I am a person with strange ears and I have never found a pair of earphones that actually fit and stayed in my ear. These, however, are completely different and comfortably sit in my ear without me ever having to push them back in. This resting inside of your ear also helps reduce pain if worn for many hours. They do not go deep into you ear, as they sit just behind the cartilage above your earlobe.The audio quality of them is superb. They never struggle with any pitch, and have especially excellent bass. Another nice thing is they don't ""plug up"" your ears, meaning they don't completely block up your ear canal and give you that feeling when you want your ears to pop.To recap, here are some of the pros and cons:Pros:Very good fit inside your earsExcellent sound qualityGreat price (trust me, it is.)Stylish and lightRemote and mic work brilliantly (you can even pause and replay YouTube videos!)Very durableCons:Wire is a little bit shortSometimes hard to put back into carrying caseOverall, these are the best earphones I have ever owned, and I strongly recommend them to everyone.

But this new approach, while it somewhat resembles the old design, is a complete transformation. Though they rest in the outer parts of your ears and do not enter the ear canal, their tiny bass port magically conveys all the deep parts of music that the old ear buds were unable to. The result: all-day comfort, ability to hear what's going on around you, and music reproduction quality that rivals competitors costing two or three times as much.Plus, you've got that excellent microphone with touch controls for music playback and phone call management.I've gone through at least a half-dozen ear bud products for use with my iPhone and iPad, and am happy to report that Apple have finally applied their creativity to the weak link in their music playback chain. For my uses, phone calls and playback of tunes and podcasts, these ear buds excel on several levels.

What works for you may not work for you (and vice versa).I have several sets of Apple ear buds which came with an iPod and an iPad. I didn't like them because they didn't fit in my ear properly. This caused them to perform poorly in terms of the audio quality and convenience.  They wouldn't stay in my ears.  I gave them to my kids to use, lose and destroy.The only ear buds I've been 'happy' with have been the in-ear type that have the soft silicone rubber things that make them fit snugly in your ear canal.  This improved the sound quality immensely but having something jammed inside my ear for long periods caused comfort problems.When I saw the new Ear Pods, I thought they would be something which would work well for me because of the way they are designed.  Ear bud purchases are a crap shoot because you can't really try them before you buy. A pair came with my kids' new iPods, I tried them and I was pleased. I bought some.The remote volume and iPod controls are a welcome addition.  I don't have an iPhone so I can't speak to the mic's performance.  I always hate sitting at my desk and fumbling for the pause button on my iPod when someone sneaks up on me and taps my shoulder. I only wish it were lower on the cord rather than near my chin.

Thank goodness Apple didn't give them some sort of special headphone jack plug (considering that they've made other items very unique and exclusive), so they can work with anything that has a headphone jack, in this case my Samsung Galaxy SIII. While some of the features don't work, I can still listen to music, and it sounds much better than the previous Apple earpods. Those were pure junk. These have nice bass too, which is a pleasant surprise. Not overwhelming, just right. I hear bass in songs that I before did not know had bass! The clarity of everything is amazing, and they are very loud! Almost too loud. I don't see spending $200 and up for headphones that supposedly aren't even that great-sounding (I'm looking at you Beats by Dr. Dre).

B0097BEG1C,A3TNPE6Q4TTN07,"Nils Rasmusson ""White and Nerdy""","[1, 2]","Since the original ear buds were pretty much worthless to me (uncomfortable, poor sound) I was somewhat skeptical of the ear pods. When I got my iPhone 5 and tried out the ear pods, I immediately noticed that these were a whole different product.COMFORT: EXCELLENTThese are comfy headphones. I have been using a pair of Klipsch in-ear headphones for over two years. Unlike the Klipsch and other headphones, these don't actually insert into your ear canal. I figured this would make them similar to the old ear phones that hurt after a very short time but that isn't the case. They sort of just sit comfortably in your ear. They don't need to be pushed in, they fit well and aren't loose and they don' wear on you after an hour or two. They just feel nice and are hardly noticeable, even after four or five hours of use. These are comfortable headphones.SOUND QUALITY: GOODThe design of the ear pods is such that they pack a good amount of quality sound in a small package and without having to cover your ears and without being inserted into your ear canal. The bass on these headphones is actually pretty good. I've had Sennheiser headphones, Bose Triports and others and these aren't as good as those but they're really decent for the size and form factor.FEATURES: AWESOMEOne of my favorite aspects of the ear pods is that I can talk, turn up the volume, turn down the volume, pause my music/Pandora/audiobook/podcast/video and resume my media all without taking the iPhone out of my pocket. That's pretty awesome. The microphone picks up my voice just fine, the volume and action buttons are responsive and extremely useful. These features alone really give the ear pods a huge advantage over the competition, especially if you're using them with an Apple product. I haven't tried them with my iPad 3 yet but I assume they work the same on that.SIZE/CORD: GREATThe size of the ear phones themselves seems great to me. The cord doesn't tangle easily and isn't too long or too short. No complaints here.SUMMARYThis is a pretty wonderful little set of headphones. I was completely uninterested in them when I got my phone. I'm so pleasantly surprised at what a nice addition these are to the iPhone. I haven't used my Sennheisers or Klipsch headphones at all since getting these. Good sound, great features and very comfortable.

B0097BEG1C,A1MQQEM7W77L62,Robert,"[0, 0]",These are great little ear phones for price. They are genuine Apple Ear Pods. The mic picks up very well; meaning you don't have to talk loud to be heard. You can also control the volume and pause play functions on iPhones/iPods. I sleep with mine in and they tend to stay in. Some people may have problems with that based on their anatomy or if they are a restless sleeper. I shouldn't review the fidelity of them since me ears were damaged by noise in the military. But that being said for me they sound great; and no I don't have to play them really loud. They give good results even at low volumes. Something important about these is that Apple seems to have fixed the insulation; the old ear buds used to stiffen up; which is probably a reaction to skin oils. I've used this model for over a year and haven't seen any of that old problem. I'm hard on mine so I bought two this time; and when I finally break these I'm buy them again.

B0097BEG1C,ARIC00M54T1YD,Robert Jones,"[0, 0]","A bit of a background:I have a pair of Sennheiser HD280 pros, a pair of Bose QC's, and up until recently a five year old pair of iPod ear buds.I posted over 1,000 running miles on my trusty old ear buds using the Nike Plus system.  I ran through snow, rain, freezing rain, and wind.  And yes - they even saw a wash/dry cycle or two.  I hated to see them go.After my initial impressions with the earPods, this is my review.Before leaving the house, I compared them sound-wise to an old set of ear buds and my Sennheisers just for laughs.The sound quality is far better on the earPods than the old earBuds, *especially* the bass.  The earPod's response is certainly not ""flat"" sounding, but it does have a multidimensional quality that the earBuds lack.  The sound quality isn't directly comparable to the Sennheisers, but those are over the ear DJ phones at 3x the price.Now, for the running.After mile 2 they started hurting my ears a bit.  I fiddled with them and they got better.  I found I didn't need to rotate them upwards as much for them to stay seated.  I was OK again by mile 3.  They do not fit me like the buds did, so it took some getting used to.  They do lock into place and they don't move.  It was cold, so I didn't sweat very much.  They have to stay in when I sweat - that is an absolute requirement.  I'm going to assume they would be OK based on how well they seated.  They are overall a bit better with not shifting around than the old buds were.Sound-wise, I was simply astounded.  There is no comparison in sound quality of the pods and buds once you get out into the world.  The pods did an amazing job with traffic and cross-winds.  The sound from the pods really cut through, especially support instruments and other sounds not normally ""up front"".  The old buds would get a very washed out sound while running with most background sounds.  Only down an empty dirt road with no wind would the old buds really give you a decent listening experience.  The pods and the buds are not sound blocking devices: you can still hear traffic, but the difference is you can also hear the music and the traffic, not just the traffic.Upon returning I inspected them.  The reason for the ""owie"" is there is a sharp oval edge on the forward pointing part of the device.  They cut into my ear a little bit.  They should look at rounding those off a bit.One more thing to point out - the remote is perfect for adjusting sound.

This is somewhat of a hybrid as the earphone directs the sound more toward your ear canal versus just putting sound to your ear.  It is also a good fit, but keep in mind that this may be subjective.  They have eliminated that soft rubbery lining on the actual part that goes in your ear which used to break down and make the earphone uncomfortable.

B0097BEG1C,A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8,"W. Hohenschuh ""Engineer On Two Wheels""","[0, 0]","I am reviewing a pair of these that came with an iPhone 5. They're nice and certainly an upgrade from what used to come with iPhones and iPods, but if I was going to spend money on a new set of earbuds I wouldn't buy these.The Fit (comfort and noise isolation):Certainly improved. The new design is more natural feeling in your ear and because the buds are not perfectly circular they do hug the contours of your ear a bit better and they do stay in somewhat better. They aren't totally secure (at least in my ear) and they provide little in the way of noise isolation. I know these aren't noise canceling and very few ear buds are, but the soft plastic earbuds offered by many manufacturers (Panasonic RPHJE120A In-Ear Headphone, Blue, JVC HAFX1X Headphone Xtreme-Xplosivs,Klipsch Image S4i Premium Noise-Isolating Headset with 3-Button Apple Control) at all price ranges do provide some degree of noise isolation and (again at least for my ears) hold much tighter than these do. I'm not saying these can't fit your ear perfectly, but even under the best circumstances they won't seal out sound.The Sound:Again the sound in these are much superior to those in the original earbuds, but not better than whats on the market. If you're serious about sound you may want to aim at a higher price product from klipsch (Klipsch Image S4i Premium Noise-Isolating Headset with 3-Button Apple Control) Ultimate Ears(Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10 Noise Isolating Earphones) or another high end brand. If you are more or less happy with the sound quality that you've gotten from your apple earbuds in the past then you're going to be happy with these and will even get a little boost in terms of clarity, bass, and decreased distortion. But if you're looking for roughly that level of sound quality you  don't need to spend $30. I'd check out the MEE M6 ear buds if you're looking for a slightly lower price and as good or better sound quality. (MEElectronics M6P-BK Sports Sound-Isolating In Ear Headphones with Microphone/Remote for iPod, iPhone and Smartphones (Black)). If you're looking for more of a bargain than that look at any of the sub $10 sets available on amazon.Call Clarity/mic remote:I admit I don't make a ton of calls. I have played around with making calls and using Siri through the microphone on these and it works well, but earbud remotes and mics aren't anything special anymore. This one doesn't do anything that the one on any set of earbuds with a 3 button mic can't do everything special about it is in the software in the iPhone so this isn't a feature you should pay more for just because its from apple. Additionally there are some really great bluetooth and wired call devices designed for making hands free calls if thats something you do a lot of. I don't know enough to comment on specific devices, but would look to a specialty product and not here if that was your priority.Overall Design: They're a good looking set of earbuds and do ""go"" with the iPhone and new devices. If thats important to you then by all means stop reading and buy this pair. You know what you're getting and its exactly what you want.Wrap upFine earbudsNothing SpecialAn improvement in sound and fit over old earbudsBut not a big enough improvement to justify the priceIf I was looking for a replacement (i.e. earbuds that I wasn't getting for free with another purchase) I wouldn't use/buy these3/5 stars",3.0,1350777600,"10 21, 2012",Apple EarPods with Remote and Mic,17.59,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21tMVjCzYNL._SY300_.jpg,,Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Wired Headsets']]"

B0097CZBH4,A100WO06OQR8BQ,"Duffer. ""Bo""","[2, 11]","This is a comedy of errors but I am writing it in case anyone else runs into any of the same situations. My wife and I have excellent cell phone service with Consumer Cellular (CC), a no contract provider. I had bought her a Motorola Bravo from them and they sent a regular size sim card which works perfectly. My wife's Chrysler 300C was starting to require many repairs and she was wanting to replace it with a Jeep.  I bought her a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited but her Motorola Bravo is not compatible with the Jeep Voice Command System. I decided to go all out and bought her an unlocked iphone 5 which I expected to be compatible with both the Jeep Voice Command System and with our carrier, Consumer Cellular. My only concern was how to get the regular sim card in my wife's Motorola Bravo cell phone down to nano size to fit the Apple. However, I figured that CC would have a solution such as sending a nano sim card and deactivating the Motorola Bravo sim card. As I wrote, I just took it for granted that this allegedly latest and greatest engineering wonder (according to the ads) would be compatible with both the Jeep and CC. So I ordered the outrageously priced unlocked iphone 5. As usual, Amazon quickly processed my order and notified me that the phone had been shipped.I called CC to request a nano sim and was told by two different reps that the iphone 5 is not compatible with their service. I decided that I would keep CC as my server but when the iphone 5 arrived I would take it down to Walmart and sign my wife up for StraightTalk which is also a no contract server and which advertises the iphone 5 in their ads. The phone arrived in a small box, the kind that has a tear-off strip along one edge. There was no packing in the box. One end of the box was open and the cellophane wrapping was torn and disheveled. I had no way of testing the phone to check for internal damage and I had enough drama so I sent it back and bought my wife a Samsung Focus 2 for about one fourth the price of the iphone 5. I called CC and they shipped a micro sim which should arrive in a few days. Obviously CC must believe that this phone is compatible with them but as for the jeep it is anyones guess.This is where my soap opera ends as far as this review is concerned. The moral of the story is that it would behoove anyone who is in the market for a 2014 vehicle with Voice Command features or is considering a new cell phone which would be used with your existing carrier or would be paired with your vehicle to do a thorough amount of research to avoid duplicating my experiences. One final note. My cell phone is a Sony Xperia P which I bought from Amazon. It works perfectly with CC and pairs and connects perfectly with my wife's Jeep. If her Samsung has any compatibility issues I will end the drama and give her my Sony. Then I wil punt.",1.0,1364515200,"03 29, 2013","Apple iPhone 5, Black 16GB (Unlocked)",518.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NLfJyDcrL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1295},Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

It wasn't a drastic switch at all, it's the same phone through and through, but there are some nice improvements Apple and Verizon made.The 4G LTE network is amazingly fast in comparison to the old 3G network.  However, upgrading to the 5 forfeits your unlimited data.  This is my biggest qualm, because now I'm always searching for WiFi so I don't exceed my 2 gigabytes a month.  It hasn't been a huge problem, it's just annoying.Second, the screen is bigger.  I didn't think this would be a huge improvement but after using the 5 for a few months now and looking at someone's iPhone 4 screen, I can't believe I ever used it and didn't have an issue with the screen size.  The screen has an incredible resolution and makes all pictures and apps look awesome.The speed of the phone itself is a big improvement.  All screens switch faster and everything feels like it's processed faster.Overall, I love this phone, it was a great buy, but man, it sure is over priced.

B0097CZF5C,AS4CM6IQHKUC6,Cougar Alex,"[0, 1]","I have owned my iPhone 5 for a little over a year. This phone has changed my life in many ways and has made everyday tasks much easier. Apple first started with making computers but since then they have reached out and made other products that have pushed technology and has made a huge difference in our society. They started making iPhones in 2007 and with every release since then they have made huge improvements. The iPhone 5 weighs only 3.95 ounces and is only .3 inches thick. This is one of the lightest phones out there. It looks so slim and attractive, and fits in your hands perfectly. This brings up the one and only problem that I think the iPhone can approve on, its durability. I find it somewhat fragile but there's a simple solution, a case. There is a huge variety of cases and accessories that can make your iPhone 100% safe. The iPhone has a 4-inch widescreen multi-touch retina display with 326 pixels per inch. This phone makes every picture, video and anything else you put on the display absolutely beautiful. It has an 8-megapixel camera that can shoot 1080p HD video. With all of its features it still can hold a charge, giving you up to 8 hours of talk time or up to 40 hours of playing your favorite music. The iPhone 5 comes in black or white and with three different sizes of memory, 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB. Depending on how much data you want to store on your iPhone there is always a right size for your needs.  I myself have a 32GB iPhone 5 and I have found that to be plenty of space for all of my music, pictures and apps.There are so many features and apps that you can get for your iPhone 5 making this phone a hugely useful tool for your everyday life. The iPhone 5 is not just a phone but many other things. With this product you are constantly carrying a camera, shooting beautiful high quality pictures and videos. The iPhone 5 also has a new HDR and panoramic options, making it easy to capture the most wonderful and priceless events in your life. As a student I have used the camera to take pictures of notes or homework assignments, making it easy to remember what I need to do and study. Other useful apps are the compass, flashlight, and calculator. You can also take notes on your iPhone, making it great for students, businessmen and even mothers for when they have to write down a grocery list. You can even put events in the calendar such as birthdays, appointments or assignments that are due and it will remind you when they are. There are many games available for the iPhone even educational ones for young children all the way up to college students. The iPhone 5 has very fast LTE internet letting you surf the web and send emails in little to no time. Another amazing feature is the navigation system that is built in. No matter where you want to go the iPhone will give you turn by turn direction on how to get to your location.With all these features it is easy to forget that the iPhone 5 is also a phone. Letting you call, text and even FaceTime, bring you face to face with people miles away. This phone can really connect you to people who are close to you and even the ones you have just met. With apps like Facebook and Instagram you can connect and share your life with the people you love.

B0097CZF5C,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,Robert I. Hedges,"[3, 4]","I have previously owned an iPhone 4 and two Android smartphones, and this is my favorite cellphone yet. I generally like the interface updates, though there are annoyances to be found. First the good news. The iPhone 5 is thin and light, which I love. It's fast and Internet connectivity is generally quite good. The camera yields generally good photos, but mine has annoying shutter lag issues much like my iPhone 4 did; more distressing is that on mine the image that is presented onscreen is not the image actually captured. Depending on whether it is in a landscape or portrait format it cuts the top or the left side of the frame off. Imagine my extreme annoyance when I discovered that the majority of photos I took from the front row of a recent Joe Bonamassa concert lopped Joe's head off, but gave spectacular pictures of his shoes. (Joe's a snappy dresser, and they were very nice shoes.) This is such an annoyance I have thought of returning it for that alone, but I normally use a camera to take photographs, so I haven't yet. This doesn't seem to be a problem in video mode.Some improvements are not. The calendar is virtually impossible to sync with my AOL calendar (multiple trips to the Genius bar and reassurances that it's entirely compatible and they would fix it have ended up with nothing.) I'd just use a different calendar app, but I have a friend who is dedicated to the AOL calendar system, so this is a better solution for me for now (providing it ever works, anyway.) I also dislike the time zone functionality when entering items in my iPhone calendar. The phone clarity and signal strength aren't that great, honestly, and may be worse than my iPhone 4. I live with them, but am not a fan. Battery life is also not that good; I would much prefer a swappable battery, but Apple seems to think it knows better.Despite my relatively minor reservations (battery life and camera problems are my biggest concerns) I still like this phone. It's light, it's fast, it's powerful, and it's still a good choice. If I had to do it over again I'd get the 64GB version to have more onboard video memory, but careful allocation of TV programs lets 32GB work adequately for me.

The Iphone 4 if I could give it a zero I would have.3rd Again apple is just catching up to Jellybean OS from android as my previous review of the Iphone 4, Apple has copied alot of stuff from Android. People who use Android will know about notification bar, Cloud backup, Widgets, Voice Navigation, Voice command, 4g, LTE, etc the list goes on but most of these feature were from 4 years ago on Android as Apple has barely put it in the IPhone. I also fix phone so I see these phone comes in for screen repair and also the back of the phone breaks a lot.  Parts are easy to find though and there are plenty of people who repair this phone.  I use every product and test it as best as I can.  I had apple when the 2g was out which was the best phone than but apple has fallen way behind and it is showing.  As far as current sales goes Samsung has taken the number one spot overtaking Nokia as the number one phone manufacturer.  Which I understand why because they do have the  best phone period whether is the galaxy note 2 or the galaxy S3.  Phone sales Galaxy Series is over 380 million sold vs the iphone 4 and 5 at only 80 million.",2.0,1351036800,"10 24, 2012",Apple iPhone 5 16GB (White) - Unlocked,514.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31wjOELyfBL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 965},Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

B0097CZJEO,A1DIFL0333QPEB,Marcus T. Brody,"[10, 17]","My headline pretty much sums up my review.  This IS a great phone. Don't get me wrong.  The 2-star rating isn't because it's a bad phone.  It's because Apple basically did nothing to upgrade the 4S other than making it a pubic hair faster and re-designing it a bit to be slightly longer and lighter.  That's it.  The 4S is a great phone, the iPhone 5 is also great, but maybe, what, 2% better than the 4S? It's not worth it to upgrade, unless you have an iPhone 3 or something.Apple is a multi-billion dollar corporation for a reason.  They're brilliant.  They could have EASILY have given us tons of additional features that they have in their arsenal, but decided that enough people would buy the iPhone 5, based on the new design alone.  The major hardware upgrades will come with the 5S next year, when we'll see a 12 megapixel camera, and various other big-time upgrades.  And guess what?  People who bought the 5 will immediately buy the 5S, because this one will actually have ""must have"" features.  Apple's marketing and the way they mind-F their customers is absolutely brilliant.  I'm not saying it's a bad thing -- it's genius.If you have a 4S, you're a sucker for getting the 5, bottom line.  Shame on you if you already did.  Thankfully, my wife got the 5 (upgraded from a 3, that was literally falling apart), so I have had plenty of time to play around with it and form an opinion.

B0097CZJEO,A3GMMI1FYLI6YF,Y. Zhou,"[21, 27]","Hi there, this is a review from a 22 year old tech enthusiast. The review is quite long, but I have organized them into separate categories, so you don't have to read the whole thing. Here's a little about myself.I am a computer science major, and have always been an Android fan. I've owned:-Nexus 4-Galaxy Nexus-Samsung Galaxy s2-Samsung Note-HTC Amaze-HTC Sensation-HTC Radar-HTC 8x-Many other older modelsNeedless to say, I have had a lot of experience of all three mobile OSes. I am very enthusiastic about tech, always swapping phones, always looking for that perfect phone. I own a macbook air and a custom built gaming desktop PC.Why I chose the iPhone over the HTC One and S4:I am under my stepdad's family plan, so when it was time to upgrade, I had to choose between the HTC One, S4, and iPhone 5. I always thought I would choose the HTC One when it first came out. However, I chose the iPhone 5 mainly because I wanted something new to try. I know that the HTC One and s4 are both great options, but they did not feel like a significant upgrade from a Nexus 4 (which I love). In fact, they seemed slower than the Nexus 4 in everyday tasks (most likely from fragmentation from HTC/Samsung overlays AND carrier apps). The HTC One has much better hardware than the Nexus 4, but there is a definitely lag in the OS due to the fragmentation. Samsung S4 does a much better job with their software, but I hate their plastic feel. IMHO, I like the overall package that the Nexus 4 gives you, which is high quality in both software and hardware. So because I felt my Nexus 4 is better than both the One and S4, I decided to try out the iPhone 5.What I think of Android:I absolutely love the Nexus 4 and the Galaxy Nexus, but I HATE every other Android phones. The fragmentation just makes the entire experience a chore. I spent so much time installing custom mods. Most of the phones had major shortcomings (no/late updates, battery life, intense lag, etc). To fix the software shortcomings, you would have to know how to mod, then research the best mods for you specific phone model, and update the mods when the ""cook"" for the mod release a new version. Furthermore, the mods you install would oftentimes have bugs of it's own. It just seems in order to enjoy non-Nexus android phones, you have to be willing to spend the time on the phone. To me, that's bull****. I don't want to spend time on a phone, I have other stuff to do. A phone should make your life simpler, not the other way around. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the Nexus 4, the only shortcoming I see it having is it doesn't have LTE and the glass back cracks easily. I'm not bashing on android, in fact there are a lot of things in android that I love which I can't do in iOS (torrents and file management to name a couple). Android also syncs well with both PC and Mac because of the file management system, and that most of its information is stored in the cloud. But the main idea here is that Android is cluttered with too many information and overlay skins (except for the Nexus phones), major drawbacks (whether it be software or hardware), and complicated. Nexus phones on the other hand, ha great hardware and software. No overlay skins or carrier apps, just pure android. Simple. If you like android, get a Nexus device.What I think of Windows Phone 8:Two words. Too young. The apps are noticeable worse than the Android and iOS counterparts. The Youtube app was downright frustrating to use. I think Microsoft is going in the right direction, giving the PC and phone a similar feel and integrating them together, but as of right now, they are still behind the curve. It syncs well with Windows 8 PC, so it is simple to use, but the apps right now are simply trash. Windows Phone feels more like iOS than android because they made it very simple to use and also limiting.What I think of iOS:Simplicity. Sometimes a little too simple (simple wifi toggles are impossible, will change in iOS 7). To an advanced user like me, it also feels constricted. I can't just drag a movie file into the iphone, I have to convert the movie file into a file that iTunes accept, then sync iTunes with iPhone. However, I do think iTunes is a pro because it is kind of like the command center of your iOS devices, where everything is located in one location, something I wish Google will work on. iOS is also very fluid. It is noticeable more fluid than the HTC One and S4, but less so with the Nexus 4. But mainly, the feeling you get with iOS is simplicity. For example, let's look at the camera app. It doesn't give you as many options as the HTC One camera app, but that's just how I like it. The options the iPhone camera let you change are the options I actually understand, I have no idea most of what the HTC One camera option even do. This can relate to almost everything on iOS. It doesn't give you a lot of options, which equates to less clutter. The options they give you are options you understand and actually use. Simple simple simple. iOS also syncs very well with other Apple products, and decently well with Windows PC through iTunes.iPhone 5 vs Nexus 4 (HARDWARE only):I'll be comparing the iPhone 5 to my favorite phone of all time (yes even more than the HTC One as explained above), Nexus 4. The iPhone have a better quality screen, better camera, better speakers, better built quality, slightly better battery life, LTE support, better call quality (3 mikes), physical camera button (volume up). The Nexus 4 have better grips, smoother touchscreen (slippery), bigger screen, faster processor and more RAM (though that doesn't matter in real life), smaller bezel. The screen is smaller on the iPhone, which many see as a con, but I know that my girlfriend actually prefers a smaller screen because she likes smaller phones (more pocketable...her words). I also enjoy having a change of pace with the smaller display, I can actually operate the phone with one hand, and it's a lot less noticeable in my pocket. In general, the iPhone 5 is better hardware-wise.iPhone 5 vs Nexus 4 (SOFTWARE only):A lot of the shortcomings for Android phones are not on the Nexus 4. The Nexus 4 is always updated with the latest software from Google, and it's super fluid. It doesn't have any HTC/Samsung/Motorola overlays, or carrier-forced apps. Most importantly, pure android feels simple. Something Google needs to work on is something similar to iTunes, a central program that keeps all the data of your phone and organizes them in a computer. I also absolutely LOVE the software ""back, home, menu"" buttons. This is absolutely genius when the first introduced it on the Galaxy Nexus. This allows the phone to give you a wider screen real-estate when you watch videos, and allowing the phone to have a smaller bezel. iOS on the other hand feels even simpler, sometimes to a fault. Like I said earlier, transferring movies onto the iPhone seems like a chore, but it does stay in the iTunes library for the future, so it's not too bad. Apple's multitasking can be oftentimes more limiting than android, but it does save battery life. I am a very big supporter of Apple's hardware and software optimization. Apple makes most of their hardware and all of their software, and they do it in a way that makes them work so well together. The iphone 5's power is probably half as powerful as the Nexus 4 spec-wise, but it runs as fluid if not more fluid than the Nexus 4. Siri versus Google Now is also something to compare, but to me they are both great options (much better than s-voice at least). Overall, android on the Nexus 4 has a slight advantage over iOS in my opinion, but iOS is more simpler and organized.  This really depends on personal preference.iPhone 5 Impressions:After using the phone for about a week, I have not had any major issues or see any major drawbacks. The phone is simple and problem free. This is in no way of saying the iPhone is perfect, it's far from it. With my previous phones (excluding Nexus 4), I've always found major drawbacks that I simply can't live with, which explains why I switched phones so many times until I got the Nexus 4, which I've stayed with for the longest. The iPhone provides fantastic and beautiful hardware, optimized and simple software, and wraps them up together into a great experience. I also know that they will keep me updated with the latest softwares, unlike non-Nexus android phones. The limitations on iOS does give me some issues as an advanced user, BUT honestly, it doesn't bother me that much, simply because I don't do many advanced things on my phone anyways. The screen is a change of pace to me also, but I do enjoy using the phone in one hand, it's a much better fit. To me, Apple gives me the impression that it doesn't do anything perfectly, but it does do everything very very well.Conclusion:Do I recommend the iPhone 5? Well, how much money do you have? If money is not an issue, go for it. If money is an issue, buy the Nexus 4. Both phones will give you a great experience. Buy the HTC One or S4 if you absolutely want a 1080p display and LTE and hate the limitations of iOS, but just know their software updates are usually months late, and sometimes will never come, and you will have a very cluttered experience. Don't buy a Windows 8 phone unless you have a very specific reason to do so.I know of the Android vs iOS flame war that goes on even today, but it really boils down to personal preference. I've been on the Android ship for a long time, because Android allows me to do more stuff on my phone. But now that I've used so many different phones, I realize I don't use my phone to do anything advanced, I save that stuff for my computer. I realize I need a phone that doesn't need me to provide maintenance and troubleshoot. I need a phone that simplifies my life. I need a phone that does everything well. Both the iPhone 5 and Nexus 4 does it. Simplicity sells, and that is one thing that Apple and Google understands. Samsung and HTC has much to learn.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE:After using the iPhone for a little longer, I can say that there are some gripes I have against it, but also some positives.CONS:-Most of my complaints stems from the lack of file management. For example I can't download a file from my email, only view it.-I miss swype-Watching videos on a 4-inch screen does seem constricting at first, but I got used to it.-When using android, there usually is always a setting I can find that would solve whatever that's bothering me, whether it's an android setting or app setting. On iOS, many times I can't find those settings.-Android notifications seem better.PROS:-I thought my Nexus 4 had a beautiful screen, but after using the iPhone 5 and going back to the Nexus 4 to try it out, I find the Nexus 4's color washed out and inaccurate. The iPhone 5 has a gorgeous screen. Nexus 4 also seems super fat now lol.-iTunes keeps me organized, and also backs my iPhone's data up. Nice to see coming from android.-The size of the iPhone really does feel great in one hand. Most of the 4.7""+ android phones feel constricting simply because you need both your hands free to do most tasks, especially on the Galaxy Notes.-The ""reader"" feature on Safari is fantastic-The ""do not disturb"" feature is more useful than I thought.-Once again, the iPhone reiterates to me that it doesn't do anything perfectly, but it does everything well.ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS:Google just added the HTC One and S4 Google Edition phones on their Play Store. To summarize, both are running pure android, thus I think they're better. HOWEVER, because Google wasn't the one who made the hardware for these phones, the pure android software isn't optimized on the phones yet. For example, most tasks seem faster on the skinned version of the phones. The IR Blaster on the HTC One also doesn't work as of right now. Small things like this makes me hesitant to pay $600 for them right now. I rather wait for the next Nexus device.",4.0,1372032000,"06 24, 2013",Apple iPhone 5 16GB (White) - Unlocked,514.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31wjOELyfBL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 965},Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

All in all it's nothing big enough for the average person to notice and I was impressed with the over all quality (one issue aside). For my purposes this was almost perfect. Make sure you remove the lens plastic before installation, it is located on the under side.Installation was a breeze, take off the screws (If you have the silly star pattern, do yourself a favor and but the right tool) slide it up, put the new glass on and slide it down. Towards the end of installation I discovered only one of the set screw mounts was properly threaded. The left side (if the phone is laying, face up) seemed to be over bored. I can see it is threaded, but the standard Iphone screws are too thin and slide right past the threads. I tried this with several different iPhone screws and they all slide past the threads. I also checked to make sure all these screws to work with the right side mount, and the OEM mounts.This was the ONLY problem, and not a huge deal for me.

I was a heavy Blackberry user in the past but as everyone knows that company has gone downhill. At that point, I made a conscious decision to switch phones and I had to decide between Android, Apple, or a Windows based system. I use a Windows laptop at home so I thought I would go with an Android or Windows phone. I tried many Android and Windows phones but did not like the user interface. The Android phones seemed so fragmented in that there was no standard; every phone manufacturer has their own version of customized Android. For me I like things simple. I next tried a Windows phone but that was the slowest phone I had ever used. I'm not sure how Metro will be but hopefully they fix a lot of those issues. I finally tried the iPhone and fell in love with the ease and simplicity of the phone. I really like iOS and how simple it is to operate. I do have to say that I would not have gone with the iPhone if it could not sync with Outlook but luckily Apple built an Outlook plugin which works very well.In terms of the phone itself, the screen is beautiful and the 8 mg pixel camera is great. The phone is quite fast running any type of app and battery life is pretty good. I thought that I would never get used to the touchscreen keyboard rather than the Blackberry physical keyboard but it is actually quite easy when you turn the phone horizontal. The accuracy is still much better on the Blackberry but you get used to the touchscreen pretty quickly!

The redesigned antenna works very well even in low signal areas, the music player, the web browser, the email client, the App Store, the camera and battery life are all best in class in my opinion.2. Out of the Apple services, the Maps app has a very good UI and is good for turn by turn navigation but the points of interest database isn't as good as Google - BUT you can always use Google Maps over the browser if you like so that is NOT a limitation in my opinion, AirPlay is very useful if you also have an Apple TV at home, iMessage and FaceTime are not unique in that other platforms have similar inbuilt apps, but the iPhone 4S implementation is simply better because the UI is much more straightforward and it never ever locks up the device or causes it to crash.3. Siri works very well for voice commands and has gotten much better of late. iCloud is also another well executed service if you want to store music and movies in the cloud and then access it from any Apple device. The iPhone 4S integration with iCloud is very good and with it, you don't need to ever connect an iPhone 4S to a computer. I have never connected mine to a PC in a year.4. The screen is very clear and is easily visible even in direct sunlight - even at max brightness the iPhone 4S has more than acceptable battery life. All the other large screen phones I have used, at max brightness the battery life start declining at very fast rate. In a nutshell, with the iPhone 4S one is not compromising acceptable battery life for screen brightness.5. While some may find the Apple UI boring, the advantage is that the UI is not intrusive and let's a user focus squarely on using apps and not on fiddling with features and functions on the device.6. The size is smaller than the typical Android phone, but the iphone 4S has a very good overall feel and for my daily use it is very convenient. I guess if you play a lot of games then a larger screen may be acceptable, but as a daily smartphone the iPhone 4S is extremely well designed aesthetically and in size. The iphone 4S is completely one hand operational without any issues whatsoever. The phone is also very well balanced to hold.7. The glass back is likely to break and that is probably the biggest drawback of the iPhone 4/S design. If you are someone who drops their phone then you simply have to get a bumper, with the bumper the phone is pretty much shatter proof. I have dropped mine with a bumper several times and the phone is still scratch free.In my opinion, the iPhone 4S is a true classic. It will easily meet the needs of most people who use smartphones. It is extremely well balanced with features and design. I didn't really mention games as a strong point, but the Apple App Store easily has the most compelling games available for a smartphone even if the screen is smaller on the iPhone. In the end the difference in screen size between the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 is only half an inch and between an iPhone 4S and the larger Android phones it's only an inch or so. In terms usability, the extra screen real estate does not matter much especially since the UI on the 4S is so smooth and responsive and zooming in and out is not an issue. It is much worse when you have a larger screen but the phone's UI stutters and apps crash and you need to remove the battery every now and then to reboot it.The iPhone 4S is one of the best consumer electronics products I have ever owned. It is so well executed that I believe it will be considered a classic. The 4S is a much better phone than the 4 and justifies the upgrade, but in my humble opinion the jump from 4S to 5 is much more subtle in terms of what more the phone can do.",5.0,1354579200,"12 4, 2012",Apple iPhone 4S 16GB - AT&amp;T -,390.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412fjFwu-jL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 59326},Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

B00CL8XDF8,AQ2FC1DLKVD8H,P. McWhorter,"[0, 0]","I wonder if I am the only person on the face of the earth that does not like the Iphone 4S. Call me an old curmudgeon, but I just call them like I see them. I got the phone when it first came out, so have had it for some time.Bottom line is that it is not a very good telephone. The number one reason I have a telephone is to make telephone calls, and I would like that part of it to work exceptionally, and it does not. Here are my list of concerns.1) Dropped/Missed calls- I live very near an AT&T; tower, and have a clear line of sight to the tower, but rarely have more than one bar at my house. The phone does not ring when someone calls me, but informs me later that I have had a missed call. Similarly, it regularly drops my calls, or gives me a ""no service"" error message.2) Poor Battery Life- I would expect a cell phone to get me through the day on a full charge. I do not mind charging the phone every night, but I want it to get me through the day. I have found that you can not depend on this phone to make it through the day. Even doing things like turning the bluetooth off and all that does not get me to the point that I can even moderately use it and not have the battery dead before I get home.3) Poor sound quality- When on the phone, I do not get crystal clear voice quality.4) Jams up - Phone jams on me every couple of weeks and I have to reset it. In particular, the skype ap appears to cause the phone problems.This phone was designed to do it all . . . it just does not do it very well.",2.0,1335484800,"04 27, 2012",Apple iPhone 4S 16GB - AT&amp;T -,390.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412fjFwu-jL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 59326},Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

The glass is scratch resistant and mine still looks like new.Facetime is great, iMessages are awesome, especially since some of my relatives live overseas.If you're wanting an iPhone, start with this one, it's the same as the 5 only a smaller screen and much cheaper now.

I decided to leave my DROID RAZR and give the iPhone 5C a chance. My first black/white unit ended up water damaged, and that led me back to Android. The phone I chose was an S4 and it was HORRIBLE. I can't not recommend that phone enough.Anyway, I found a good deal on another white 5C 32GB and decided I should buy it. I am pleasantly surprised with the phone. Very loud speakers, SIRI is awesome as always. I thought at first the charging port would inconvenience me, having all of the same hookups, but ALL i needed was a lightning port converter and I was back in business the way I was working originally. With my job-site radio I can use the auxiliary hook up and all works well.There are two things that irk me to no end about this phone and I cannot stress them enough, that said, I feel that would bring the phones rating down if I impacted such the score on the overall rating.My problems are this: Apple doesn't allow you to set songs as ringtones, YES, there are a couple of applications that do just that out there, but they involve you using different software and different things on Itunes, wish it was as easy as it was on the Android phones.The second problem is the camera has been somewhat iffy since day one. My 5C was still in warranty (the new one) so I did swap the phone and have also restored it once, the pictures just either look dark or cloudy. I've done EVERYTHING that Apple has said, and still come up on same problem. I've just had it on this phone, and I've owned a 2G, 3G, 4 and 4S before this.However for the 16Gb and the starting price of 99$, you can't pass on that deal. You are getting a great phone for a great price. I had to order a 32G because I have way too many pictures and apps, but that phone was the price of the standard 5S 16G. This phone works as well, who cares its plastic on the back it won't break as much as the other iPhone's do, and you can get a case and it won't annoy you.There will always be a ""bagger"" of a certain item, but I think you can trust someone who works in the mobile phone industry fixing and selling phones. I really like this phone and I think Apple is on the right track. Same speed as my exes 5S phone. I just think a lot of people think, wow, it's made of plastic, I don't want to deal with a plastic phone, but you need to realize, it's the same phone and comes in different colors. I think it's better than the 5S personally.Another thing I wanted to also say is that cases weren't readily available when this first launched. However, this was remedied in recent months by manufacturers of cases such as INCASE and Incipio stepping up and making functional cases everyone loves!If you are on a tight budget, or just want a nice phone in a cool color, choose this.

B00F3J4B5S,AXO4PQU0XG3TG,Dwight,"[7, 18]","ETA 5/11/2014:  Apple is now committed to pushing this into their affordable category.  The $99 deals abound not just for mother's day and store employees have been given this device in exchange for the last lowest commonn demoninator model - the ipod touch.***This phone is not as audible as the 4 for an unknown reason - it has to be on its maximum volume level and even then words are missed and you have to ask the caller to repeat themselves.The White/Silver version looks VERY Korean.  It's not slick and sophisticated in my opinion.  It evokes the spirit of a Samsung smartphone in white that has been shrunk down.  If this were the Iphone6, I would be much happier since a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 order was cancelled to get this phone but we felt we really needed an updated smartphone.  Hopefully, Apple devices will retain their resalability.We have laptops and rokus using wifi with no problem but the touch 4g always buffered after a few minutes and you would think that this latest and greatest would have as decent wifi as a $35 Roku LT but that is not the case.  Since I am not an Apple addict, I would return this phone and never touch another Apple device but I am not primary user of this brand's products so I try to do as much research as I can stomach to cushion the expected frustrations of signing on to own and participate in this artificial reality.The sensor issues seem to be due to a new supplier, Bosch, and that means ALL the new phones are affected and Apple is not known for doing a product recall.  The sensors are off by DIFFERENT degrees so it is not believable that any firmware or app will be able to offset the sensor - at best, they will embed software that will throw the sensors off in the opposite direction to minimize the amount it is off level.  SO LAME. I haven't pulled out a carpenter's level yet to test it but the ongoing revelations including a teardown of the phone indicate that Bosch screwed up and all 5s and 5c owners will be stuck with this because Apple never fixed antennagate on the iPhone 4.  They certainly never contacted owners of the 4 to offer them a free case as their idea of a ""fix"" for the antenna problem.It takes forever for the fingerprint sensor to identify your fingerprint so get comfortable before you press your finger on it because you can't lift it up until Apple is finished.SIRI is a toy - an elaborate Magic 8 Ball with more responses tuned in.  It is easier to voicedial on a dumbphone than to use Siri's primary purpose in life because ultimately, Siri is NOT AT ALL intelligent.  What Siri does do if you play around long enough to realize is RECORD YOUR VOICE and then repeat what you said in Siri's voice which means their software coded your voice and translated into Siri's voice - it does NOT mean that Susan Bennett happened to record the same words that you just spoke to Siri.  That in addition to the fingerprint sensor and the cameras mean this device can COPY you.Still, we are okay with upgrading to this phone.  There simply were too many things after two years that the Iphone 4 could not do like iBook.  We never updated the iOS 4 sparing us battery issues like the ones for the Touch 4G so this is how we think the Apple devices work - when you can afford to upgrade, pick the latest model even if an older version is free so you don't get locked out of new features like ""autofocus"" that only works with the 5s camera.Don't sell your old iphone for ninety bucks or whatever.  Keep it and don't order product protection so if the new phone gets destroyed or stolen before the two years are up, you have a cheaper backup than the monthly protection plan.When the next iphone after your version is iminent, upgrade your iOS and then never upgrade it again to spare yourself all the coincidental problems that make you want to upgrade to the latest and greatest that don't suffer all these handicaps after ugprading to the new iOS.Scour the repetitive articles and then turn off all the settings that drain the battery like auto app refresh.KNOW that Apple does not do product recalls and be careful with overcharging your nonremovable battery.  If not for Android updating and malware issues, we would have broken from Buying American (Chinese suicides) for the Samsung Galaxy Note 3.  Ultimately, we just didn't want to do too much work with a smartphone so we are still with Apple.  Apple customer service is not that great, not at all generous but if we have to have a smartphone which is driven by the media to be a keeping up with the Jones, it is better to be with the operating system that seems favored by app developers and yes, there is a cultural comfort level with dealing with an American brand.After our problems with the touch 64gb and Apple customer service being no help with the battery issue, we are loathe to max out storage for any Apple device with nonremovable memory and battery but 16gb fills up pretty easily so we are going with 32 gb.  The Iphone has not sold me on Mac computers which I have never owned and I think are overpriced and some kind of IDEA of computing that is not value for money though it may look and be easy to use.  As smartphones go however, Android is an unpreposessing name and so are their iterations especially ""jellybean"" - very offputting.  The fact that even if you don't mind not getting a timely OS update may still kill the apps you do have and that malware is an issue with the apps forcing some phones to get bricked is why we are not indulging in the tempting Samsung offerings.We don't trust Apple because of what we learned from the touch 4g battery issues but we don't trust nonApple brands more as a result of not trusting Apple.The issues with Gmail privacy have certainly cast suspicion on the integrity of what Google does including their Android OS.  Whatever happened to not being evil?If Microsoft had the breadth of apps and media products for sale (Android doesn't have the scope of the iTunes store) then I would consider a Windows phone but browsing the Android app store - no South Park episodes! - made me cancel the order for the Samsung Galaxy Note 3.  Hopefully, the resale market for Apple will still be healthy then - another difference from Android phones.CASE of choice:Tylt Energi Power Case for iPhone 5/5S - Retail Packaging - Black/Graywhich is subtly shaped in a charming way and feels MUCH better than the rubbery grippy silicone cases so even if it did not provide the extended battery, I would still use this case BUT the lightning cables are no longer needed as it has a provided micro usb cable.CASES THAT BLOW:SPIGEN SGP SGP10088 Slim Armor Case for iPhone 5/5S - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Metal Slatehas a too low ridge around the front offering little if any protection and it was too thick to allow the lightning cable from monster to charge the phone.

Even credit agencies are not optimistic about their prospects. Sony's credit rating? Junk. Sharp? Junk. Panasonic? Junk.Research by Morikawa and Goto shows how in 2012 Japan's electronics giants were using Apple as a life support system.Some of the figures are staggering.At Sharp's Kameyama No. 1 factory near Osaka, 100 percent of liquid-crystal display panels were devoted to Apple.

B00F3J4B5S,A1RPTVW5VEOSI,Michael J. Edelman,"[11, 12]","After years of prodding from friends (""What? A techie like you doesn't have an iPhone???"") I finally broke down and bought one- the top of the line, with all the bells and whistles, and the maximum memory. It's a bit of a hit to the pocketbook, but I thought the payoff would be in portability and the computing power. And for the most part, I've been pleased with it. I love how it shares data with my iMac and iPad. But I do have some issues.It's certainly amazing how Apple has managed to cram all that computing power and battery life into such a tiny package, but they've done so at the expense of ruggedness and battery life. The first purchase I made for mine was an Otterbox Defender, and the second, an auxiliary battery and a second charging cord for in-car use. The case, because I can just see dropping this wand watching $849 turn into several ounces of inert plastic, glass and silicon, and the cord and battery because compared to the cell phones I've been using, this phone is a real power hog. While it gets a lot of oohs and aaahs for its tiny packaging, it would be nice if they made it a bit thicker and doubled the battery capacity. It would be even nicer if they made a ruggedized version with extended battery life; I'm thinking of spending another $99 and buying a Morphie case with a built-in battery.I would have also like to see Apple provide better tools for importing data from an older technology cell phone. The use of the nano-SIM means that this was the first phone I has where I couldn't simply slide the card out of one phone and into the next. It also means that I can't quickly switch to a back-up phone if this one suffers a failure and needs repair or replacement.So yes, an impressive phone and impressive technology. But not quite as practical as I'd hoped.Two week Update:As the novelty has work off, and I'm no longer checking it every few minutes just because of the novelty of it all, I find that the battery life is much better than I'd thought as first. But I'm still keeping a charger at bedside, a charging cord in my car, and a small back-up battery in my parka. I'm also finding more useful apps for it- even after having used an iPod Touch and an iPad for years. In fact, I'm starting to realize tha Apple has now successfully locked me into the iPhone.... forever. Sneaky, Apple.

B00F3J4B5S,ANZ3GVYW66TBS,Steplander,"[4, 5]","The iPhone 5s is a pretty amazing phone and I would get the next version, when it comes out, if it weren't for the following MAJOR problem:APPLE has programmed the iOS so that all messages, inbound and outbound, including attachments, are saved on the phone with absolutely no option, within the OS, to delete them.Sure, they let the user THINK they have deleted the messages and attachments, but a quick dive into the phone's list of memory hogs shows that the MESSAGES app is taking up more and more space every day.If you enjoy sending and receiving pictures and videos via message, every time you do, it deletes from your available memory with no option, within the OS, to recover the memory that was just used.Now some people, in the conspiracy world, may think that this is a way for your personal messages to be recovered or spied on.... But I think the reason is more insidious. They don't care about your messages. They care if you buy another phone and buy one sooner and buy one with MORE memory because they cost MORE. And, yes, that new, more-memory, more expensive I-phone is going to experience the same memory choking end.Yes, I have confirmed that Apple is aware and has been aware of this ""problem"" and that they have been aware of it through the release of one iOS after another. Considering the logical ease of programming the ability to actually delete a file and recover memory, (we do it all of the time when we take photos off the phone) it's a logical conclusion that APPLE wants this included in the design of the phone.It's highway Robery It's unethical. It's grounds for a class-action lawsuit.And it's why I would never buy another one.Extra note about the 5s: (and APPLE is also aware if this one... And has no plans to fix it.): the power button is seated in such a way that it rattles. It may not sound like a big deal when you first hear it. It's a light tapping. But, the way the button is designed, pill shaped and curved on each end, when you are taking a video, the button teeters within the case portal and rattles. To the ear, it sounds like nothing. On the video it sounds like garbage cans being hammered on.Apple's response is that ""it is not a defect. It is a ""feature"". It was designed for those people who accidentally dunk their phone in soda or coffee. If they do, this special metal button won't stick""I've actually talked to a few APPLE ""geniuses"" who read this prepared response to me. Ingenious! Call a defect a ""feature"" and avoid a recall.So, there is my sincere review of the iPhone 5s.I cannot suggest a different phone because I have no idea if the other companies are resorting to the same nasty tactic.

B00F3J4B5S,A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,The Guardian,"[5, 5]","In the past 4 years I have owned Android and (the now virtually redundant) Blackberry phones prior to buying an iPhone 5s in early December 2013. Overall I prefer the iPhone over the others and would recommend it, with a few minor reservations.The iPhone 5s is superior in these areas:1. The design is a work of art, finely sculpted and proportioned; a pleasure to hold and use2. The screen is fantastic; big enough to be really useful but small enough for the phone to be easily pocketable. The Blackberry screen was maybe too small for most applications except for email, and the Android too big and heavy for portable use. I particularly like the long narrow screen on the 5s3. A lot of thought has gone into the way a user can navigate around the screen through the different functions. I have owned an iPod Touch for a couple of years and have become a fan of Apple's clear and simple graphics: on the 5s, it's even better. The software never crashes, which it did with both my Android phones frequently4. For a user with larger than average hands/fingers, the on-screen keypad of the 5s is really well designed - especially true if you use the phone in landscape format which has the effect of widening the keypad. In comparison, the Android was frustrating and not very user-friendly and the Blackberry Storm completely hopeless - though the permanent keypad on the Curve was great5. The ring tone & speaker volume is louder and clearer on the iPhone than any of its rivals6. Phone reception is the best. I don't know how Apple manage this, but I have made and received calls in locations where other phones don't seem to work  - like travelling on the London underground and in deep underground car parks7. The camera is so good it's up to the standard of a dedicated Canon or Nikon compact, for the first time on a cellphone8. The memory (64GB) is vast, with a storage capacity so huge you're never likely to need more no matter what you download and store on it9. Siri, iMessage and Facetime are genuinely useful apps, not just gimmicks. They actually work well. The fingerprint scanner works too, though how much of a real security feature this is remains doubtfulGripes: very few -1. The battery life isn't great, but no worse than the Android Galaxy 4 and you can substantially improve it on the 5s by turning off power-hungry applications2. The unique nano-SIM means you can't swap the SIM over to another phone in an emergency, or for example if the phone is damaged and needs repair3. The price of the 5s is a bit steep, but here you really do get what you pay forOverall I have become a reluctant Apple convert. It's easy to see why they have become market leader with such an excellent product. Of course in another 2 or 3 years the tech will have moved on again, there may be a new market-leading manufacturer and the 5s will be an antique. But until then, the 5s for me is the King of cellphones.Finally, a lot of one-star reviews posted on amazon are from buyers griping about having been shipped locked phones by online sellers. This must be very frustrating but these are not really product reviews, they are complaints about the seller. The solution is easy: buy from an Apple store and they'll set up the new iPhone for you and transfer all the data from your old phone.",5.0,1389744000,"01 15, 2014","Apple iPhone 5s, Space Gray 16GB (Unlocked)",664.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515TE1kAhkL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1111},Apple,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"
