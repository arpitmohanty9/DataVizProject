Picking it up you can feel a little weight to it, you can tell it is not a cheaply made charger.After plugging in my phone and iPad 2 into the charger, both notified me that they were charging. I charged my devices on my drive home for work, phone charged 20% and my iPad 10% in about 15 min.I make a few trips to Colorado per year (300 miles) and will use this every trip. The kids love to use the iPad in the car, but the battery will be out before we get to our destination. Now we will be able to charge it like we had it at home plugged in.This is great for those on the go people that need a good quick rapid charge for your phone, but also need to charge an iPad. This charger will work with any device that can be charged from a USB cord(5v).Anker gave me this product in exchange for my honest feedback.",5.0,1365984000,"04 15, 2013","Anker&reg; 24W Dual-Port Rapid USB Car Charger with PowerIQ&trade; Technology for iPhone 5s 5c 5; iPad Air, mini; Galaxy S5 S4; Note 3 2; the new HTC One (M8) and More (White)",11.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314CnBxZKEL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 145},Anker,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Car Chargers']]"

This unit fits the bill nicely, so much I bought one to test and ended up ordering two more. I have no tested this up to the rated 2.4amp claim, but at 1.4 amps with my Nexus 7 tablet it is still putting out a nice stable voltage. I then hooked up my Nexus 5 phone at the same time and it was fast charing both.I hooked it up to my bench power supply and fed it 13.92 volts. I then connected my USB current / volt meter and then my Nexus 7 tablet. It was putting out 1.41amps at 5.22 volts. Not bad, that's about as I've ever seen my Nexus 7 draw while charging. When I then connected my phone (which charges around 1.2 amps) the voltage stayed nice and steady. This thing works - and I've VERY pleased.It's also quite small -- when inserted into the lighter all that sticks out is the little cube end with the two USB ports. There is no silly and ugly LED light to blind you at night either.Highly recommended as I have found all Anker products to be well designed and work well. I purchased the 6000mah portable power bank and a 3000mah one for my mother and another for my father and all of those devices work great too.",5.0,1403136000,"06 19, 2014","Anker&reg; 24W Dual-Port Rapid USB Car Charger with PowerIQ&trade; Technology for iPhone 5s 5c 5; iPad Air, mini; Galaxy S5 S4; Note 3 2; the new HTC One (M8) and More (White)",11.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314CnBxZKEL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 145},Anker,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Car Chargers']]"

Thanks to PowerIQ, it can charge any device on any port, rather than having to put Apple devices in some ports and Androids in others for best charging efficiency -- I've always felt I was getting only half the use out of those devices.I have an app on my android tablet that tells me what my amps are coming in when I plug the device into a charger. When I've used ports that were designated for Apple, even though the port was rated at 2.1 to 2.4 amps, it would read lower coming in than the Android port that was was listed as 1.0 to 1.2 amps.

Even if a charger ""works with your device"" it may be painfully slow. Get one that will charge your devices at full speed (like the charger that came with your device).For starters, the ""Amps"" need to be high enough. That's usually 1 Amp for smartphones, about 2 Amps for large tablets. (A higher amp charger is always OK.) Some chargers are only 1/2 Amp (500mA).Problem is, Apple devices use their own rules to decide charging speed. A designed-for-Apple charger may be slow to charge non-Apple devices, and vice versa, even if its Amp rating is high enough.Anker gets it right by optimizing one port for Apple products (including iPad) and the second port for non-Apple products. The two ports make it versatile, even if you never charge two devices at once. However, the Non-Apple port is limited to 1.5 amps, which could mean reduced charging speed for some 9-10"" tablets.PROs:* Full speed charging (claimed) for most USB-charged devices* Two ports separately optimized for Apple and non-Apple devices- Branded product - Amazon reviews apply to this exact item.- 18 month warrantyOKs:- Reasonable price (but prices fluctuate)- Appearance & detail: Good- No power-on light - could be a pro or a con- Reasonably secure fit in your 12v socket - could be better- Port labels (Apple & Android) are hard to read- Ports are ""upside down"" (just use it with Anker logo down)- User manual: Complete and clear- No cable includedCONs:- Android port limited to 1.5 Amp output (according to Anker specs)- - - Dimensions - - -0.93"" x 1.03"" x 3""Protrudes 1.5 to 1.75 inches from 12v socket when in use.- - - Alternatives - - -There are dozens of other car chargers on amazon.

I have not noticed a significant difference in the charging times.  Neither charger is particularly fast, but that is the way they are supposed to operate to optimize battery life. As described if you attach 2 devices at the same time they will take longer to charge. It will also get warm so you should unplug it when you are not charging your device.

I had bought Anker batteries before for mobile phones, but never saw them for much more than a good OEM replacement. They have since grown to an excellent company with awesome products.This little charger is an awesome unit. It would be nice if Anker threw in at least one USB cable for it, but I can't complain. I got some really nice MediaBridge cables for a good price (6ft cable 6 dlls each).Charged two Galaxy SIII from about 40% to 100% in a little under an hour. Keep in mind, it charged them BOTH AT THE SAME TIME. Exactly what the doctor ordered.

First, I have to push it hard so it will reach the contact of my car's socket, this may be due to the spring mechanisms on the side of the unit being new and still stiff, though I never encountered this problem with other car chargers. Second, there is no indication that it is fully seated inside the cigarette socket because it doesn't have any light indicator so you have to look at your phone if it is charging. Third, it doesn't come with a cable. These to me are only minor flaws, and I have to say I am only nitpicking.Kudos to Anker for their great Rep (I forgot her name)  and their produKt support.",4.0,1398124800,"04 22, 2014","Anker&reg; 24W Dual-Port Rapid USB Car Charger with PowerIQ&trade; Technology for iPhone 5s 5c 5; iPad Air, mini; Galaxy S5 S4; Note 3 2; the new HTC One (M8) and More (White)",11.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314CnBxZKEL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 145},Anker,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Car Chargers']]"

Started with the Anker 21W Solar Charger, and it blew me off with the way it charged all my phones and even my tablet. Then I bought the 15.000 mAh external battery, and it is also amazing.Now finally, bought 2 of these little car chargers, one for my own truck, and another for the company's truck, 'cause I do aprox 15.000 kilometers/year visiting clients. So that means, I'm almost 10 hours per day on the road. And I want all my gadgets to be charged all the time.My first try was, connecting both my Galaxy Note 3 (3.200 mAh battery), and my tablet Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 (8.220 mAh battery) at the same time. Both were on, and with 50% charge at the beginning.In less than 2 hours, they both charged all the way to 100%! And unlike other chargers I've tried before, it didn't even got hot. Barely warm. For the size of my batteries, I know it gave minimun 2 Amps in both ports, at the same time. Which is awesome!One port is labeled Apple, and the other, it says Android. As I could read, if you connect android, you will have less current in the apple port. So I connected the Note 3 there. But I don't think it will even make a difference.

The devices will charge extremely slow, and some won't charge at all.  This charger pushes 2.4 amps (Max) per port simultaneously.  This allows you devices to charge at a much faster rate.  With other car chargers, if I was using the GPS on my Lumia 920, while charging, the battery would actually go down.  With this charger I can use the GPS while the phone is charging (Going up, not down) and have my wife's iPhone charging at the same time.

B00B8M4IMK,A2UEB48LAWFUCW,"Joseph ""jck09""","[1, 1]","Back in the old days (a few years ago), anything that charged off a USB cord used only the trickle of power that PCs with USB 2.0 provided.  (About 5 volts x 0.5 amps = 2.5 watts).Now, however, we have power-hungry devices like the Kindle, the iPad, and various android tablets and related gadgets that will take more power if they can get it.  I've tried a bunch of car chargers, and when Anker offered me the this one in return for an honest review, I jumped at it, and am glad I did.  I'm leaving this in my car as my regular charger, and my old one is on a short trip to my ""extra electronics"" drawer.This car charger is built for people who want to fast charge two simultaneous devices: an iOS device with a port that puts out up to 2.1 amps, and an ""android"" device from a second port that puts out up to 1.5 amps.  (If you assume 5 volts, that gets you to 18 watts overall.)I don't have an android device or a Kindle, so I plugged my iPhone 4S into the ""android"" port and my iPad 3 into the ""apple"" port.  Charging was as good as I could reasonably hope - the iPad went from 17% charge to 22% in a 20 minute drive, which is pretty good given its oversized battery.What I liked:- This puts out a lot of power to two ports.  If you need power under these specs, or if your device can adjust, it's nice, particularly since an iPad is so hard to fast charge.- The ports are wired separately, so using both at once won't reduce the charge in the individual ports.- It's relatively low profile (sticks out about an inch), a good looking apple-ish white, and fits well.Some observations:- This has no charging light.  That doesn't bug me (I'm more interested in whether my DEVICE says it's charging than whether the plug does), but was a surprise.- No cables are included, but I assume you have plenty of USB cables for your devices at this point.- Most devices are smart about how much power they take, but if you have an older device that is somehow not supposed to charge from a fast feed, I'd be careful.- It's kind of a pain to tell which port is the ""apple"" port and which one is the ""android"" port, so I circled my apple port with sharpie.All in all, highly recommended if this fits your power needs.",4.0,1365984000,"04 15, 2013","Anker&reg; 24W Dual-Port Rapid USB Car Charger with PowerIQ&trade; Technology for iPhone 5s 5c 5; iPad Air, mini; Galaxy S5 S4; Note 3 2; the new HTC One (M8) and More (White)",11.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314CnBxZKEL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 145},Anker,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Car Chargers']]"

Both products did charge, and the iPad 2 was charged from 52% to 74% battery life in about 40 minutes which isn't actually bad from a car charger at all.

B00B8M4IMK,A1CBB2CYNLU8O,K. Crawford,"[334, 354]","There is a lot to like about this charger. 1st and foremost, it is amongst those few chargers that both clearly indicate what types of devices it will charge and supports the vast majority of both Apple and Android devices.  This is a lot more rare than many realize, as it is impossible, without some sort of switch/configuration, to have one port on a charger that supports both Apple products and Android products.This charger goes the route that a few others have and allocates one port to Apple products and one to Android.  This is great for flexibility, and while when the idea was first introduced I thought it was a great solution, over time I've grown somewhat disappointed with it.  My family, like most families, have settled into being a one-OS family (Android in our case).  So what good does that 2nd port, which only supports Apple, do if all my devices are Android?Yes, I know that I can use special ""charging cables"" to make ports designed for Apple products work well with Android devices, but personally I find that a weak solution.  It means I have to carry two different types of cables on a trip, one for an actual USB connection to a PC and one for charging.  I'd rather not have to do that.This charger also has another new feature, one that I've only seen on one other charger, the PowerGen 15W charger.  Most multi-port chargers, even those who support different devices on different ports, use one voltage converter to power all the ports (called ""bridged"" from this point forward).  The downside of a bridged solution is that if one device pulls too much power, the other device suffers.  This device has two entirely independent converters, so if one device pulls a lot, it will have no effect on the others.  Kudos to Anker for taking the lead on that.The downside for this device is that both ports do not have the 2.1 amps of current I would like to see, that the most power hungry devices require.  The Apple port is spec'ed to 2.1 amps, but the Android port is only spec'ed to 1.5 amps.  This means that people with 10"" Android tablets won't be pulling the full power they could, even if the other device is only an iPod.  The bridged products don't suffer similarly.  However, it is worth noting that this device is better than the one other device that has it, which only has two 1.5 amp ports.As for whether this delivers on its specs, my power draw testing passed with flying colors.  The USB spec is that the voltage shouldn't dip below 4.75 volts.  The 2.1 amp port was at 4.81 volts when I was pulling nearly 2.2 amps. The 1.5 amp port held at 4.90 volts even when I pushed beyond 1.6 amps.  This makes this the best performing charger I've tested.  As an added bonus, when I did push the unit significantly beyond it's amperage specs, the ports went into auto-shutoff preventing damage to the device, yet another positive for this device.I had two minor dislikes for me personally:  It doesn't support the HP Touchpad (I recognize few of you will care) and it doesn't have a power LED.  I know some will like that, as they don't like the distracting light, particularly at night.  For me however, I prefer a light (not too bright of course) so that I know the device is working (or at least claims to be).Overall, for people with an iPad and an Android phone, or an iPhone and a 7"" Android tablet, or a her iPhone and his Android phone, or an iPhone and a lower power device (less than 0.5 amps) or is willing to buy a ""charging cable"" I think you'll be happy with the device.  Not only does it deliver a lot of current, its good construction and compact size also are positives on its side that you'll like.For me personally, this will replace my 15W bridged device from PowerGen for when I have one Apple and one Android device, but I'll keep using the 10W bridged device from Bracketron for when I've got two Android devices or am lugging around my HP touchpad.For device manufacturers, if you want my coveted 5-star rating, this is what you have to do:1. Deliver 2.1 amps to both ports2. Make each device configurable (a small switch, etc.) to be either Android or Apple3. Have good ergonomics/quality/compact size like this Anker4. Support the HP Touchpad (OK, you don't really have to do that, but I'd really appreciate it anyway)Notes on the devices I tested with:-HTC Evo 4G LTE - showed ""AC charging""-Kyocera Rise - showed ""AC charging""-LG Optimus S - showed ""AC charging""-4th gen iPod Touch - charged correctly-HP Touchpad - didn't charge correctly-Breadboard with cut cables, power resistors and a fluke DVM used for power draw/voltage testsFull disclosure: Anker shipped/gave me this product for free in exchange for my honest feedback.",4.0,1365638400,"04 11, 2013","Anker&reg; 24W Dual-Port Rapid USB Car Charger with PowerIQ&trade; Technology for iPhone 5s 5c 5; iPad Air, mini; Galaxy S5 S4; Note 3 2; the new HTC One (M8) and More (White)",11.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314CnBxZKEL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 145},Anker,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Car Chargers']]"

B00B8M4IMK,A2BFYI8ESHH0S1,Ken S.,"[0, 1]","When I first bought this device, I thought it  would be a sound buy based on other reviews. It's built sturdy and supposedly packed more than adequate power to properly, quickly and fully charge 2 Samsung GS4s simultaneously with no effort. The ""IQ"" technology was also exactly what I was looking for.It also does not have a lighted display telling you it's on, which I personally liked as your devices tell you that already. However, if your vehicles charge port is not switched (Constant On), you may forget it's plugged in and may result in a dead car battery if left in for a while. Finally, I liked the fact it can't be seen reducing the chance of attracting thieves because it's not lit and is seated more than half way in my port.The problem is that only after 3 short uses, and not even both ports, it failed without warning.

My Galaxy S4 and a few other Android devices do. Other reviewers with workbench 12v outlet would be able to do more accurate reading, but for my purpose, the app suffices.With a good cable, a single Galaxy S4 can pull 1960 mA (~2A) from either port. Again, CABLE MATTERS. If you read reviews that say that they're not getting high current, chances are they are using sub-standard cable. It's trial and error with cables, unfortunately. Good, shorter cable (6 inch to 1ft) would most likely be able to deliver high current, but it depends on the quality. Longer cable can deliver high current if it's shielded. The 6ft cables that come with the later Galaxy and Nexus devices are good cables.Pros:1) High amperage supplied power to the device (with good cable)2) Not too bulky3) Good price4) Anker has a great customer service from my own personal experienceCons:1) Label is so tiny (doesn't matter for me cause all of my devices are Android)2) Long form factor.

B00B8M4IMK,A1DR5BZQ8HJUT0,M. Hadland,"[1, 1]","I wanted this Anker 18W charger since we have multiple smartphones and iPads, and only one 12V outlet in the car (yeah I know, first world problems). We make a lot of long drives to my treatment appointments in a major city two hours away, and in that time a phone used as a GPS or an iPad that wasn't charged up the night before can easily die. There are very few chargers on the market that have dual ports that have the kind of power output (18W) necessary for plugging in an iPad and another smartphone. You'll be familiar with the ""not charging"" indication you get on the iPad when your charger doesn't have enough power, and the iPad will charge at a snail's pace, if at all.They say to never judge a book by its cover. I wasn't impressed, initially with how the Anker 18W charger was packaged. It had slipped out of the cardboard holder and was just loose in the box. Coupled with the rather plain packaging, it just screams poor design. However, it is a product I obtained for its purpose, not for its packaging.The charger is quite compact, which is wonderful. I am used to having to buy bulky chargers that get in the way of the gear shift. The sleek design is well labeled; it's easy to see which port is Apple-specific, and which is Android/other. I've both other multi-chargers that may confuse some, as they are simply labelled A and NA.I had a chance to test it out the other day on a long car ride. I wanted to play around on my iPad while my mom wanted to charge her iPhone. I plugged the iPad in to the Apple port and it immediately displayed ""Charging,"" so it was getting enough output (at least 10 watts, or 2.1amps). The iPhone has an iOS higher than 5, and if you read the instruction manual, iPhones of iOS 5 or higher can indeed charge in the Android port at full power. Once the iPhone had charged, I swapped it out for my HTC EVO 4G LTE, and it also charged in the Android port with no issue. At this time I do not have a watt meter to measure power consumption during charge, but the iPad battery was charging 1% every few minutes.Thus, Anker's charger, in spite of the modest appearance, will more than ""wow"" you with its circuitry. Anker has thought of every variable in terms of product design. It does everything it claims, and upon reading the manual, it does even more: you can charge an iPad and an updated iPhone or Android at once, two iPhones, or an iPhone and and Android phone.In my opinion, they should highlight this feature, that the Android port can charge iPhones of iOS 5 or later at FULL CHARGE. I could find that benefit nowhere on the box.I surmise that since the iPad Mini is relatively new and also uses a 5W, 1.5amp charger, it should also charge fully on either the Apple or Android charging port. Anker could also update its instructions, and benefits to include the iPad mini.They have a great product that I highly recommend, and if they can get their packaging design to the next level, then they can more than compete at least on the shelf with ""the big boys,"" the more well-known manufacturers. They certainly have the customer service and warranty to back up their offerings like the more well-known names: there is an 18 month manufacturer warranty on this charger, granting an unconditional replacement or refund. You can't go wrong with service like that.Anker gave me this product in exchange for my honest feedback.",5.0,1366761600,"04 24, 2013","Anker&reg; 24W Dual-Port Rapid USB Car Charger with PowerIQ&trade; Technology for iPhone 5s 5c 5; iPad Air, mini; Galaxy S5 S4; Note 3 2; the new HTC One (M8) and More (White)",11.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314CnBxZKEL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 145},Anker,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Car Chargers']]"

I found out that the Apple port pin 2,3 were not bridged and therefore when charging an Android device, it could only draw 500 mA (ok for a smartphone if it's not running all kind of apps, but most Android tablet won't work as 500 mA is not enough to charge a table). The Android port was fine as pin 2,3 were bridged (connected internally)so an Android smartphone or tablet can draw for up to 2A.I wish the description can be more clear or I wouldn't order it.Updated 10/18/2013:  After I posted the original review, Anker customer service contacted me immediately and helped me to get a refund. I applauded them. They are truly responsive providing a great service to their customer.  I procascinated for a week due to other committments and then I bought a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 to replace the Galaxy S2. I tried the Anker again and to my surprise, the Note 2 could draw 2A from both ports that the S2 couldn't.  I went online google it and true enough, the new Samsung is smart enough to draw the Apple port at full 2A required by the new Galaxy. So now I'm happy and I won't return it.

My iPhone4 uses the 1.0A outlet and my iPad uses the 2.4A outlet. It cost $10 and so the world was in harmony and life was good and simple...UNTIL (hang on to your seat folks!!!)The evil corporation that employs  me decided to upgrade my phone to the iPhone5S and my girlfriend decided that she needed a Samsung Galaxy with a screen bigger than a small flat screen TV.So now the requirement for power changes and while the Mediabridge works well, we are unable to charge both phones at the same time. It's not always that important that we have to charge at the same time, however, even if it was my (or her) iPad and/or one of our phone, then the situation would be about the same. On top of this, I always try to buy more than I need just in case the evil dark lords from the Nth Dimension (aka my boss [LUV YOU GUYS!!!]) decides I need to go through another upgrade, I wouldn't have to keep buying new charger, but just appropriate power cord.I started looking for something that would handle atleast 4.8A and came across this offering from Anker. I ordered one to test and see if I like it. Other reviews seems to give it high marks, so I figured its probably not a bad waste of $12.The charger arrived in a really nice box (I'm giving Anker an 'A' for presentation), but I was slightly disappointed as it seemed a bit cheapish on the build. Plastic casing looked cheap and weak, there was not a flexible side connector, but a sold piece, so I figured the performance would be as equally disappointing. HEY... its only $12 right, so who cares...So I plugged it into the car for a trip to Myrtle Beach with the girlfriend and friends and....OH MY DOG!! (sorry I'm also dyslexic) this thing charged ALL the phones in the car. It didn't seem to care what phone, or who by. It charged my iPad and her friend's iPod without a problem. While it ran a bit hot, it otherwise performed terrific without skipping a beat. Only problem was it can only charged two devices at any given time... so I decided to buy another one, but this time in black just to see if there's any difference. no difference.Overall, I can only say very positive things about this charger. YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH YOUR $12 IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A NEW CAR CHARGER!! this offering from Anker has to be it.Good luck on your purchase and I hope you enjoyed the humor.

B00B8M4IMK,A2DKQQIZ793AV5,Twister,"[0, 1]","I got this car charger to use mainly for charging up my Note 2 in the car, and from my own personal experience I use Note 2 every day as GPS to/from work. Everything is usually on (display, bluetooth), plus GPS/Google maps are up, and I take/make phone calls in a middle of all that. What does that mean? Battery is draining really fast, and even with car charger you need at least 2A output to be able to charge at faster rate than discharging with everything on. 2A charger is not hard to find, although question always come up if you can trust their actual rating. If you want to take it to the next level and charge another smart phone, you can probably find a dual charger with 2A and 1A, although reliability and current sharing during simultaneous use of ports might be in question. This new product from Anker took it to the next level where they are offering dual port output with 2.1A and 1.5A outputs and guarantee full current supply from each port at the same time. In terms of reliability, they are offering 18 months warranty which I think is a bold statement of confidence in their product.3.6A, which is 18W, is a lot of power and to my surprise the charger was actually very small and lightweight. The dimensions of the end with dual ports is only 26 mm x 24 mm, and the whole charger is very lightweight and only 22g. This small size is very convenient for tight spaces like in your arm-rest compartment, and just in general is unobtrusive to use anywhere in the car. I know they advertise it as dual port with 2.1A for Apple (obviously iPad) and 1.5A for smart phones, but I confirmed that Note 2 charges perfectly from Apple port. As a matter of fact that would be the best port to use for Note 2 fast charging.Overall it's a great little dual usb port car charger from a trusted company with a punch of 3.6A capacity split between 2.1A and 1.5A ports where both can be used simultaneously so you can do a fast charging of two devices at the same time.

Usually when a USB cable is plugged into a port, the pins would be on the bottom half and the USB port pins are on the top half.  It really bugs me but it doesn't affect functionality.Second is that I did not get a good fit when plugging the charger into my car's cigarette lighter.  There would be no conduction and it wasn't charging so I thought I got a bad unit initially.  I had to jam it in real good for it to work.  It could be my car's fault but I had other USB chargers that fit just fine.Lastly, the charger sticks out like a sore thumb compared to other chargers I've seen that are smaller and nearly flush with the surface, but I can't fault Anker since theirs are capable of charging power hungry tablets which likely requires more hardware to do so.Besides the nit picking, this is a fine quality made charger and would recommend it to those who needs a high amp charger for their tablets.",4.0,1367280000,"04 30, 2013","Anker&reg; 24W Dual-Port Rapid USB Car Charger with PowerIQ&trade; Technology for iPhone 5s 5c 5; iPad Air, mini; Galaxy S5 S4; Note 3 2; the new HTC One (M8) and More (White)",11.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314CnBxZKEL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 145},Anker,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Car Chargers']]"

B00B8M4IMK,A23NSKTMSPPBTR,Wayne,"[0, 0]","I already have several dual port chargers for my car, and I bought them because they were cheap enough when on sale. But they were cheap for a reason. In retrospect, if you take away the criterion that it has to work, I could have paid even less. So this time I wanted to go for something with quality from a manufacturer whose products I already trust.It would seem as if getting five volts out of a 12 volt car battery would be simple enough. But most chargers simply don't supply enough current. They are often only 500mA, while this one gives you 3.6A. That's enough to actually charge an iPad, while with other chargers, you might be able to maintain (or charge very slowly) your battery level in your phone and possibly slow down how fast your iPad drains its battery. This device will charge as fast as Apple's wall charger.This has the appearance of a high quality product. It doesn't look like something thrown in as a device accessory. It lacks an LED, which the manufacturer thinks adds to the elegance. My initial thought was that I rely on the LED to know when the device is working. But it may be that I needed it because other power supplies/chargers didn't work reliably. Since the devices themselves let you know when they are charging, I should have no problem without the LED.This one costs more. But you get what you pay for.

We were out on a nice sunny day, and had been off-roading the day before to a remote lakeside beach.  Most everyone's phones were dead from trying to use GPS, so I brought this panel out to test it's abilities.  I laid it flat across my ARB awning, attached my friend's iPhone, put the iPhone in the attached velcro pouch, and let it charge.  The phone pouch hung perfectly down to the side of the awning so it wasn't in direct sunlight.Well, on a clear sunny day this fully charged his dead iPhone 5 in 1:45.  We couldn't believe it.  Faster than his home charger, he claims.  So, I put my Droid on there and took it from 34% to full in less than 2 hours as well.Not only did it charge faster than any of us expected, it's built well.  The grommets on the corners are solid, and the material feels like canvas.  It folds up compact to the size of my travel notebook, just smaller than an 8.5&#34;x11&#34; sheet of paper and it's less than 1&#34; thick folded closed.  For what it does for its size, it's an asset I'm happy to carry.Needless to say I'm highly impressed with this panel.

B00E3OL5U8,A37NK8HCBRLUJW,Barnegat Bay,"[0, 0]","I&#8217;ve had my Anker 14 watt solar charger for a couple of weeks now.The Anker solar charger cells are rated at 14 watts, and as Anker states, the unit produces 5 V with 2 amps max, or 10 watts under assumingly IDEAL conditions.  Apparently 4 of the listed 14 watts are lost via internal wiring and circuit board configuration.Thus for practical purposes, under a bright sunny sky with no cloud cover at all, the 10 watt realistically probably produces 6-8 watts, settling at 7 watts +/-.These probable 7 watts at 5V will produce 1.4 amps.When I use my Cooper 120V wall outlet charger, 5V at .7 amps (700mA) it charges my Lumia 925 battery (2000 mAh) at the rate of 6% for every 10 minutes, or an output of 3.5 watts.Extrapolating; The Cooper&#8217;s 3.5 watts charges the Lumia 925 at a 6% increase every ten minutes.  Thus, the Anker&#8217;s 7 watts should charge the Lumia 925 at twice the rate in a bright sunny sky.  7watts/3.5 watts = twice the rate.So, with the Anker, the Lumia 925&#8217;s battery rate will increase by 12% every 10 minutes under full sun.  Example &#8211; a 50% battery should be fully charged in just over 40 minutes.In all tests, the Anker was hung vertically, or, laid flat on a table.  I did not angle to the sun, nor rotate with the sun.  That would be too tedious.In a nut shell, when charging my Lumia 925 (2000mAh) I have found that for every 10 minutes:1.  In full outdoor sun there was a 10% increase in battery life.  Close to my aboveestimate, and better than the Cooper.2.  In full outdoor sun to haze a 7% increase.  Just about he same as the Cooper.3.  With a hazy sun to partly cloudy 4% was achieved.4.  Outdoors and indoors in the shade produced little or negligible results.5.  Hung on an east facing full sun storm door with a screen produced 3%.6.  Placed on a sill between the screen and glass of a west facing window 3.8%7.  Placed against UV tinted windows &#8211; ZERO.Actual test results:My first actual test was outdoors in full sun for only ten minutes with my Lumia 925.  The Anker panel was place flat on a table for 10 minutes and the battery rise went from 83% charged to 93% charged.  A 10% increase, for an output of 5.8 watts for the 10 minutes (again, extrapolating with the 3.5W at 6% via the Cooper) on the Anker.  Pleasing.My next test was a few hours later with a partial cloud cover (50%).  The Anker was again placed flat on a table outdoors.  My Lumia battery was at 84%.  With a check every 10 minutes, the battery took 40 minutes to reach 100%.  The average rate of charge for each ten minutes was 4%.  Again, extrapolating with the Cooper, the production rate on the Anker with partial cloud cover was 2.3 watts.  Acceptable.With a full to hazy sun, the Lumia went from 83% to 90% in ten minutes.  This was a gain of 7% or a production of 4 watts.With the Anker outdoors, placed flat in the shade on a full sun day, the Lumia went from 44% charged to 49% charged in 50 minutes. An average increase of 2.5% every 10 minutes to the battery.  A charging rate of 1.5 watts every 10 minutes.  Not too great.The Anker was then hung vertically on an east facing storm door window (not tinted) that has a fine mesh screen.  In the shade on a full sun day, the Anker did not produce a charge.  It seems that being in the shade and the screen hampered charging.  Drats!With the Anker on the same storm door window (not tinted) that has a fine mesh screen.  In a full sun, through the screen, in 45 minutes, I had a battery rise of 13%, or 3% every 10 minutes, for a production of 1.75 watts every 10 minutes.  Somewhat acceptable.On a clear day, with full sun, I put the Anker on an indoor tinted window (all the windows in my house are UV tinted).  Zero charge.  I read that tinted windows will let a solar charger function to a degree.  With my tinted windows, there was NO charging.  Drats!I opened the west facing tinted window and placed the Anker against the fine mesh screen. I draped the USB cord on the sill and lowered the window back down carefully to close the window.  Inside, I placed the micro-USB in the Lumia.  With a full sun and some haze, in a 2.5 hour test, checking periodically, the Lumia battery went from a 42% charge to 100% in the 2.5 hours.  This worked out to an average 3.8% rise every 10 minutes, for an average production of 2.2 watts every 10 minutes.  This is acceptable as it is easy to set up here and the sun lasts at this window for four hours.I then tried my tablet with its huge 9000mAh battery.  Since my Lumia battery is 2000mAh it should take 4.5 times a long to obtain similar charging results.In a full to hazy outdoor sun, the tablet&#8217;s battery went from 85% to 100% in 1 hour and 20 minutes.  A 15% gain, which translates to a 1.8% gain every 10 minutes.If you multiply this 1.8% gain by 4.5, the 8% resultant is very close to the actual 7% gain of the Lumia in a similar outdoor condition.I am more than pleased with the results and potential of this Anker 14 watt panel.I hope I didn&#8217;t bore too many people with this drawn out review.

B00E3OL5U8,A2BDDXDLQ2I6AM,Nick Fortag,"[1, 1]",Do you need something to charge your phone on a hiking trip? Well this might just be that device for you. The charger is really light so if you have it in a backpack your won&#8217;t even notice you have it. It has a nice big pocket inside for you to keep your charging cable in it. The design of the product is really nice. It looks like it can take some drop damage. The only major issues That I have came across is that it sometimes won&#8217;t charge your device. Like on an iPhone it comes up with the message that this accessory isn&#8217;t compatible to charge. The only way I have found to fix that issues is to unplug the device from the charger and plug it in again after that it seems to work just fine.  It charges your device rather slowly which is understandable since its using the sun to charge. Overall this product is a really neat product.

B00E3OL5U8,A1WV4VF9PVRRYX,Sharpie1,"[1, 1]","I have had this solar charger for around a week now, which has given me time to thoroughly test it.  I am very impressed with its performance.Test One:  iPhone 5C Charge from 0% to 100%:On my first test, I totally discharged the battery on an iPhone 5C by running the flashlight until the battery was completely drained.  The next morning at 9AM, I connected the iphone to the solar charger.  The screen indicated the phone was charging.  I placed the solar charger on the rail of my deck - and at that time, it was sunny out but the sun was obscured by a large oak tree on the edge of my property, so the solar charger was not in direct sunlight.I checked it again at 1PM (4 hours later), and the battery was at 41% charged (as indicated by the iPhone's display).  It was mostly sunny that day - and at some points, the sun was obscured by clouds - although at around 10:30AM, the trees no longer obscured the sun from the solar charger.At 4:30PM (7.5 hours of charging), the battery was at 82%.  When I checked it this time, I noticed a message on the iPhone's display which read ""This accessory may not be supported.""  I saw that the little lightning bolt charge indicator was also not on, so I disconnected and reconnected the charger.  The lightning bolt charge indicator came on again.  Based on my experience - and in other things I have read, this message appears if the solar charger is producing a low amount of current (when obscured by clouds, etc.) - however, charging continues during these periods of time although at a lower rate.I checked it again at 5:30PM and the iPhone had 100% displayed for the battery level.  So within 1 hour, it went from 82% to 100% (during a period of the day when it was clear and sunny).  I am extremely pleased with these results.Test Two:  Charging the Anker 10000mah External Battery PackI bought the ""Anker 2nd Gen Astro E3 10000mAh with PowerIQ(tm) Technology"" external battery pack from Amazon at the same time I purchased this solar charger.  I paid $29.99.  Link is:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009USAJCC/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc;=1I totally charged the battery pack, then used it to charge some devices until the battery pack was totally discharged.  I then connected it to the solar charger the next morning at 8:30AM and left it plugged in the entire day.  I checked it periodically throughout the day.  The day was very sunny, although there were some intermittent clouds - but very few.  It took around 4 hours to go from 0% to the 25% mark (as indicated by one of the 4 LEDs remaining steadily lit.  I left it plugged in the full day until well after dark.  When I checked it after arriving home late, the 3rd LED was blinking and 2 of the 4 LEDs were steady.  This indicates that the battery pack was between 50 - 75% charged.I plugged it up again the next morning at 9AM.  When I checked it again at 1:15PM, the battery pack was totally charged.  I unplugged it and plugged it back in to confirm.  I am also extremely satisfied with these results.  This battery, at 10000mah, holds a lot of charging potential.  I can charge an iphone at least 3-4 times and and ipad with it as well.I also bought a little USB fan from Amazon (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XN24GY/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1).

It seems sturdy and has charged both my iPad Mini and iPhone 5s almost as fast as if they were plugged in to the wall.  I find it works fine when laid flat in sunshine, charging with no problem.  I tried leaning it up at a bit of an angle against a picture window...there it was a bit touchier.  It did fine on the iPhone, but wanted the sun to be full on it (no overcast clouds) to maintain a steady charge for the iPad.  I'd hear a faint beep and find a message on the screen warning me that not all connections could charge an iPad...but when the sun came back out full, it did fine.  Essentially it seems that for the iPad, overcast days and/or the angle of the charger makes a difference...which I'd expect, since it requires more power.  The next day, outside with the charger laid flat, it did a super job.I'm very pleased with Anker products...I own about 5 items or more, and every one has worked as expected or better.

B00E3OL5U8,A2DKQQIZ793AV5,Twister,"[1, 1]","My obsession with external batteries started a couple of years ago after a few nasty storms we went through here on East Coast. Nothing is worse than loosing power for a week or more and figuring out how to charge your phone. Around that time, I was thinking how great it would have been to have a solar panel.  Looking around for available choices, I was pleased to see 14W foldable dual-port model from Anker.I was pleased to see that no matter how big or small a product Anker sells, it still arrives in an environmentally friendly packaging. Once you take it out of the box, you can really feel it's hefty weight, almost 1.7lb. Unfolding the charger revealed 4 solar panels, each one about 6&#34; x 9&#34;. Everything was packaged inside of foldable rugged construction made out of heavy polyester canvas material. The solar panels were not removable and stored inside of individual pockets covered by heavy duty clear PET plastic screen material. A lot of thought went into the design to make sure the construction is durable for outdoor use and the front of the panel, which supposed to be exposed to a sun, will remain undamaged in direct heat. As a matter of fact, once you unfold this solar charger, you will find an extra fold with a dual output USB port and a velcro pocket where you can store your smartphone or external battery to keep it away from the direct heat. It actually came very handy when I left my phone outside charging and was able to keep it out of the direct sun light inside of this pocket.Without a doubt, this is a very compact foldable solar charger, but how does it perform in the sun? Unfortunately for a few days when I was testing it, I wasn't able to take advantage of a full direct sun (cloudy). From the spec of this charger, it can supply 5V with a combined 2A between both ports. It's definitely possible and I've read plenty of reviews with people who were able to get maximum charging speed. In my case, the first test didn't yield the greatest results because I was sitting in a shade and was only able to get 300-400 mA of charging current. The next day I was able to get better results with 800 mA of charging current, though it was still a bit cloudy outside. I'm pretty sure in a direct sunlight I will be able to get a much higher current reading. So my plan is to continue testing and posting my updates.Overall, this was my first Solar Charger experience, and I found it to be very impressive. Of course, the big limitation is finding a perfect sunny spot to take full advantage of maximum charging speed. But even if you are stuck in a shade or the sun is down already, you can still get enough charging current to boost your smartphone or tablet battery. With a very competitive pricing and backed up by 18-months warranty, this solar charger can come very handy in a lot of places where you're away from the power outlet.",5.0,1398816000,"04 30, 2014",Anker&reg; 14W Dual-Port Portable Foldable Outdoor Solar Charger with PowerIQ&trade; Technology,69.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51c7QRDDVnL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 819},Anker,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Solar Chargers']]"

B00E3OL5U8,A1YEPFLLH42OU1,"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia ""Yu-Jin Chia""","[120, 130]","This is the best direct-charge panel I've seen for anything near this price. It isn't the most lightweight or compact unit out there, but it's reasonable at both and does a very good job charging for the size. The panels are well protected and the package is built to last.The charger has two 2 Amp, 5V ports- however the total output is 2 Amps. So you can charge two devices at 1 Amp or one at 2. Aside from a few tablets, there's not many out there that can handle more than 2 anyway- most phones use 1 Amp input. The panel does not have a built-in battery, but you can just hook one up. I've used it with the Astro E5 and it works fine.I was able to charge a smartphone from dead to 100% in about 4.5 hours, with the panel unattended in somewhat direct sunlight on a partly cloudy day. The phone in question was a HTC One V with a 1,500 mAh battery. This is great performance, considerably better than several 7W panels I've tried. I should also note that this is able to charge anything I've thrown at it even on not particularly sunny days. That can be an issue for some smaller panels, as they simply don't have the power to charge certain devices. In fact, if it's a partly cloudy day some smaller panels can actually end up draining a device's battery- especially if it's a device that wakes the screen or shows something when it starts charging. Since the charge is more likely to be intermittent, dropping in and out of the necessary minimum voltage, it can repeatedly wake the device and actually kill the battery.The panel folds up into a roughly 8.5x11&#34; package, about an inch thick. The dual charge ports are enclosed in a pocket large enough to hold most smartphones, with a velcro fastener. There's four metal holes for attachment, and the whole thing has a velcro flap to keep it wrapped up. The whole thing is wrapped in thick canvas. When fully unfolded, it's a pretty good size- about a yard long; you can choose to leave it partly folded and it'll work, but at less power. This is definitely more suitable for leaving out on a table or chair somewhere in the sun, not carrying strapped to your back or somesuch. It weighs a pretty good amount too, so I wouldn't use it for backpacking or other activities where space and weight are at a premium. However, it's plenty rugged and effective for a camping trip or emergency use. I'd even say that this is suitable for daily home or work use, as it can provide a significant boost to your smartphone or external battery pack within a reasonable time. I've found that smaller panels are usually not practical for this as you'd have to leave them out in the sun for hours on end to get any significant result, and due to their small size a slight change in weather or shadows can greatly impair their effectiveness.As with most panels, leaving it behind glass does impair the charge rate pretty heavily. Fortunately for this one, it's very well protected with hard, clear plastic on all the panels and will work fine outdoors. This protects them well against scratches and impact. The panels themselves appear to be weather resistant as described, though I doubt the charge ports are- it can probably hold up to some light rain since they're covered by the flap, but otherwise I wouldn't leave it out in inclement weather. Honestly though, as far as leaving it outside charging, I'd be more concerned about someone making off with it than the unit being damaged by the elements. If you can seal off the ports and whatever devices you have attached, I have no doubt that the panels will be able to take whatever nature can throw at them.This panel is worth the cost, for sure- it's better than some considerably more expensive ones on the market. It's a good compromise between power/function and portability. It isn't for every use scenario imaginable (nothing really is) but it works well for what I'd use it for (camping, topping off my phone at lunch, emergencies). The build quality is solid, and it charges things fast. Under ideal circumstances, it is actually as fast as a wall charger.

But within the first month, two of the five ports stopped working. Other reviewers report similar problems, so it would seem there is a quality-control issue with this product, or the unit has a design flaw that makes it too delicate or too susceptible to failure.Anker offers an 18-month warranty, but for me the time and hassle involved in repackaging, making a special trip to the post office, etc., hardly seems worth the trouble for a product that only cost $25.  So I'll probably just keep it until the remaining three ports die, as well, and then buy something else.Update 07-21-2014: Anker emailed me directly after reading my negative review and offered to ship me a new unit at no cost and without having to return the old unit.

I don't have a &#34;desk&#34; area I always return to, except for my night stand. So like a lot of night stands, it was a ridiculous mess of chargers. And I would often take those chargers (or one or two) with me in my bag in the morning. A lot of plugging, unplugging, a mess of cords, power strips, extension cords (ever try to plug in 4 or 5 chargers in one area?) - ugh.This replaces them all. Perfectly. No - better than replacing them. This charges anything. Fast. This has a single, neat, normal AC cord (no brick) that leads to a tiny little white (or black) box with USB connectors where you plug in 5 devices. It's much smaller than it looks in pictures. It replaces 5 chargers, and it doesn't get hot. How? Why it works so well and others don't - it's a mystery.I've bought Anker products for a couple of years now, and always thought well enough of them, but between this and their new Astro2 chargers - wow - I need to invest in this company. They will OWN the accessory market soon.With this - you can travel with ONE CHARGER! You AND your wife! You can go to a hotel and find just one lousy AC outlet, with no space for a brick charger/wall wort, and plug this in - the 5 foot cord (a detachable industry standard one, too!) is usually plenty long enough so you can charge and use your devices while lounging in bed.Here's what I charge with mine at home, often 4 or 5 of these simultaneously:1) 7 inch Nook Tablet that's always running as a video baby monitor (and it likes a 2 amp charger since it's always on)2) a Nook HD+ 9 inch tablet (this also uses a 2 amp charger, but when the screen is off it's far less demanding)3) A Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - also always on as a clock (and this really demands a 2 amp charger)4) A Plantronics Wireless Bluetooth Speakerphone5) A Plantronics Bluetooth headset (technically the charging case/battery for the Voyager Legend)6) An Anker 2nd Gen Astro2 9000mAh external battery chargerLike other Anker products of late, it comes packaged nicely with good quality instructions, and the device itself is rather stylish and feels like an extremely high quality unit. But even without some of that - it's still a must have.Seriously - this is one of those seemingly silly little quality of life enhancing items that once you have it - you're going to wonder how you lived without it - like a good remote control for a TV/DVR/AV receiver, or your first remote garage door opener.They're in and out of stock lately - a hot item (I had to get white, in fact, since black was out of stock), and for good reason.

Thanks to PowerIQ, they can charge any device on any port, rather than having to put Apple devices in some ports and Androids in others for best charging efficiency -- I've always felt I was getting only half the use out of those devices. My only wish for these batteries would be for the output to match the number of ports at full speed (2.4 * 5 = 12 amps out shared among the five ports), as the total amps shared by the three ports is 8.I have an app on my android tablet that tells me what my amps are coming in when I plug the device into a charger.

B00GTGETFG,AYARZE7CWXX1M,Amazon Customer,"[2, 3]","I have come across the Anker brand in recent months, and grew liking its product. So far, I have owned three different Anker product.This device stands out just by looking at it. The enclosure material (faux leather) feels sophisticated, not like some cheap plastics. It is well built with attention to detail. Even the packaging and manual are carefully designed, like what you would expect from something made by Apple. While I hate those clear plastic packaging when you have to rip the whole thing apart, unboxing this charger is a great experience in itself.I liked the concept of a multi-port charger that does not require users to know which port any particular devices are plugged into. The most common USB cable is about 3-ft. If you plug a bunch of them into a multi-port charger, you would have a hard time to tell which port is charging which device, unless if 1) you color coded the cable itself; or 2) there are individual LED indicators.The lack of LED light is a good thing, since most cheap devices have very bright LED lights, especially the blue kind, which has its own health risk. The concept of charging any ports you want is perfect, as it completely eliminates the need for LED light. One might argue that it might be helpful to have at least one LED lamp to indicate that the adapter is plugged into a power source, or additional lamp per port to indicating that the device is charging. But com'on, most device would have its own indicator that tells you whether it is in charging mode or not, so there really isn't a need for any LED lights on the adapter.I also purchased the Quirky Cordie cable organizer to compliment this charger, and it really work together.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GUS4XK/The cable organizer allows four cables to be firmly anchored (pun intended) together, so you don't have to mess with the entanglement of the mid-sections of multiple USB cables. I used this to secure all the cables into a manageable bundle.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MMEHKG/That allows one empty charging port from the charger that I can use for some ad hoc pieces, including a proprietary cable used by some weird bluetooth headset.Now, back to the charging capability. While all the discussion about IQ design and charging protocol intelligence sound interesting, whereas the talk about energy efficiency makes you feel good, I find most reviews lack substance. That is, how do we know for sure that it actually is performing better than other chargers.My experience tells me that it is not as good as it claims.To test my theory, I tested it against charging Nexus 5. I waited it for the device to discharge to 6% remaining power, and plugged in the charging cable. (No other ports were used for charging.) It took 2 hours 20 minutes to reach full charge. The starting and stopping timestamps were measured by an Android app called Battery Graph.In another word, this charger is 27% slower than the standalone ASUS charger!!!The second test uses the OEM charger that comes with a first gen Nexus 7 (2012). The ASUS adapter is the most capable standalone chargers in my possession, which delivers 2.0A. (I did not choose the LG charger that came with the Nexus 5 because its stated charging amperage is merely 1.2A.) Under the same charging condition, the charge took 1 hour 50 minutes.That means, the Anker 40W charger takes 30 minutes longer than the 2.0 standalone charger to fully recharge the device. That is disappointing.For my third and last test, I used a second gen Astro 3 12000mAh external battery, also manufactured by Anker. It took about 2 hours to charge from 6% to 90%. I didn't complete the test, since it is already surpassed the time the ASUS charger took for full charge. In that sense, both the Anker charger and the Anker external battery are charging at the same rate (a.k.a., both graph slopes are similar). Because they both claim to use the PowerIQ technology, I came away with the conclusion that this Anker charger (as well as the external battery) is as good as I could get from this design, so I am not inclined to return (or exchange) it for a better one.However, it is certainly not the fastest charger you can get. The full charging capacity you get from this particular charger is definitely less than the charging capacity that is allowed by the device itself (Nexus 5 in my example).While I'm keeping the multi-charger, I am not doing away with my ASUS charger any time soon. I used the ASUS charger for all my devices as much as I could before I had this Anker charger, and I would continue using that one.when you are going to buy this product, have an expectation that it is really not charging as fast as it can. And it could all come down to the (conservative) design born out of engineering.",3.0,1400198400,"05 16, 2014",Anker&reg; 40W 5-Port Family-Sized Desktop USB Charger with PowerIQ&trade; Technology for iPhone 5s 5c 5; iPad Air mini; Galaxy S5 S4; Note 3 2; the new HTC One (M8); Nexus and More (Black),49.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31wyR3-Ix%2BL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 29},Anker,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Travel Chargers'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories', 'Touch Screen Tablet Accessories', 'Chargers & Adapters']]"

B00GTGETFG,AVPNQUVZWMDSX,"esanta ""esanta""","[1, 1]","I had previously purchased the 25W white model, but since I needed an extra one this one looked like the one to get. The biggest surprise when I received it was how much smaller it is compared to the older 25W model.A huge benefit is that this new model does not have specific high power tablet ports: you can plug in these devices in any port as long as the total power drain remains below the total 40W capacity. Since I don't own four iPads, I wasn't able to test what happens when you exceed the capacity; this product is actually capable of charging four iPads simultaneously at full speed, or three iPads and two iPhones. This doesn't seem like such a good deal, but it's really nice not having to pay attention to which port you're plugging in your device, or having to unplug a lower power device because you inadvertently plugged it into a high power port you now need.Considering its tiny size, this is the only travel charger you'll ever need.The front houses five USB connectors; the back a standard AC outlet for the supplied AC cord (should you lose it or forget to take it with you, a replacement can be found in most supermarkets, Radio Shacks, even some dollar stores). I'm using the connector that came with my iPad charger instead; I wish Anker supplied one, it would make the charger more compact and more convenient to take on trips, where cords always add too much clutter (and often trigger TSA bag inspections)I have purchased many high power chargers and so far this is by far the best I've seen. Very small, powerful, more flexible than others thanks to its unique feature, and best of all, it's inexpensive.Make sure you don't buy the 25W model by mistake. It's a little less expensive, but the extra five bucks for this one are well worth it.

B00GTGETFG,A1WUQF5HWBAQJU,JJG,"[3, 4]","UPDATE 5/7/14: Since writing the original review and sending the product back, Anker contacted me directly. They asked if I would tell them more about the issue I was having with it charging my iPad at very slow rates and said they'd like to assist me with the technical difficulties I was experiencing with the 5 port charger. They were very friendly and wanted to make it right for me. In the end they asked if I'd be willing to try the charger out again and I agreed. It is rare that a company is this on the ball and goes out of their way like they did to make the customer happy.Again, the second Anker charged my family's smartphones at the correct charge rates. The second Anker, however, charged the iPad 3 close to the charge rate of the 2A power supply that comes with the iPad. With the original Anker 5 port charger I received, my iPad charged painfully slow, at about 9% every hour. That is half what it should be. It was like I was plugged into a 1A charger every time tried charging my iPad. With the new 5 port charger it charged at a rate of 16% every hour. While not quite as fast as when using the 2A power supply that comes with the iPad, it is close enough and very usable.Due to the customer service experience and considering the second Anker I received charges my iPad at near normal charge rates, I'm upping my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars. Had the first charger I received charged my devices like the second charger does, I would have given the product 5 stars. Considering the first charger was defective, I have to take something off even though the customer servicer experience was second to none.----------ORIGINAL REVIEW: Doesn't Charge iPad At Appropriate RateAs a top reviewer I commonly get requests to review USB charging ports, USB car chargers, and external battery units for smartphones and tablets. I've done quite a bit of testing of various chargers for my family's iPhones, iPad, and other devices. iPhones charge at 1% per minute with a slow down once the battery hits 80%. iPhones charge at that rate regardless if connected to a 1A or 2A supply. With a 2A supply the slow down once the battery hits 80% isn't quite as apparent as when charging with a 1A supply. The iPad comes with a 2A supply. With a 2A supply, the iPad charges a little under 1% ever 3 minutes. If the iPad is connected to a 1A supply the charge rate is half that; a little under 1% ever 6 minutes.I recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy S5. The S5 comes with a 2A supply and charges a little faster than 1% per minute with a slight slow down once the battery level hits 80%. With a 1A supply the S5 charges a little faster than 1% every 2 minutes. After adding the Samsung Galaxy S5 to the mix of devices needing charged (also have a Kindle, helicopter, and external batteries), I started looking for a USB charging port that would charge whatever device I threw at it and one that I didn't have to worry about which port I was plugging a device into. Due to the Power IQ feature and overwhelmingly positive reviews of the Anker 40W 5 port charger, I purchased it.The Anker 5 port charger did charge my iPhones, 4s and 5s, along with the Samsung Galaxy S5 at the appropriate rates, based on the power supply that comes with each device. However from the first time I charged my iPad 3 I could tell it wasn't charging at the correct rate. Using the cable that came with the iPad 3, I charged it in different ports, with other devices, and charged it by itself to the same result. Using the Anker 5 port charger, my iPad 3 charged as if it was connected to a 1A supply. It charged at a rate a little under 1% ever 6 minutes. The Power IQ feature didn't work or isn't compatible with the iPad 3. Due to the painfully slow charging of my iPad, I'm returning the Anker 5 port charger and can't recommend it to anyone who has an iPad.",4.0,1398470400,"04 26, 2014",Anker&reg; 40W 5-Port Family-Sized Desktop USB Charger with PowerIQ&trade; Technology for iPhone 5s 5c 5; iPad Air mini; Galaxy S5 S4; Note 3 2; the new HTC One (M8); Nexus and More (Black),49.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31wyR3-Ix%2BL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 29},Anker,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Travel Chargers'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories', 'Touch Screen Tablet Accessories', 'Chargers & Adapters']]"

B00GTGETFG,A37TFUSY61EFEB,John,"[2, 2]","This is my second attempt at this product. My first order of this item had 1 out of the 5 USB ports defective. No matter what cable or device I used nothing would charge from this one defective port. I then returned it and ordered another and all USB ports worked for the first couple days. Now, again one out of the 5 USB ports will not work at all. This is the second time a USB port has become non-operational for this product and something tells me it has to do with quality control or poor design. I'd like to hear from Anker themselves as to why this is happening and what they are willing to do for me. I want to be able to use this product without worry that it will become defective in only a couple days from using it but so far this has been a very poor experience. I have purchased Chinese ripoff chargers before for older phones that I have owned that lasted years and truthfully never burnt out. I hope there is a good reason for this problem otherwise I can't imagine putting much trust in this product.Look forward to being contacted by Anker.UPDATE: 7-22-2014I was contacted by an Anker rep within 24 hours of my post. I provided my serial number for my defective product, was instructed to keep the defective unit and a new one was shipped out to me. I have received the new product and so far all USB ports are working and I have been using it for over a week. I was told by the Anker rep that there may have been a bad batch reason why I got two defective units in a row. After a week using the defective unit it only had two working USB ports left on it so I trashed it after receiving the new one. I am glad Anker is watching their reviews and they care so much about their customers to do all they can to make things right. I couldn't give 5 stars because of the time wasted on ordering 2 of these and returning my first to Amazon. My main reason for buying this was to use it for a 2 week travel out of the country and I had to use the defective unit for the two weeks I was out of the USA.

B00GTGETFG,AP85QMV9WIZ73,K. S. Mathoda,"[0, 0]","I really like this charger.  I bought two others, one is the 4 port plug in type - works fine, but both it an the cable type have a blue LED that gets annoying after some time (would help as a night light though - needed in a hotel room).The Anker 40W has two significant advantages - one is that your iPad can be plugged into any port rather than in specific ports - that is less of a problem if you have different cable types, but if you have iPhones and iPads and all of them have lightning conductors it is a pain to trace back to see which end you plugged the device into - it is not a show stopper but a minor inconvenience.

However, the  line cord was thick, stiff and cheap material. The connector was the wrong length for the socket on the power supply.Unless you are going to plug this into the wall and never move it, every time you need to deal with that line cord, you will hate it. I actually replaced it with one from a parts bin that was the right size and more flexible. This is an easy problem to fix and hopefully they will do so. Otherwise, an excellent power supply.Followup:I own other Anker products and find them to be well made and useful.The day after receiving this power supply from Amazon, I was contacted by Anker to see if it was satisfactory and I expressed my concerns about the line cord. They were very helpful and while unable to fix the problem immediately, took my suggestions and commentary to their product management.Then, immediately after posting my review, I was contacted by Anker support again and have been in dialog with them since. They have replied personally to my emails within hours and always constructively. They provide direct and personal contact information for your representative which is a breath of fresh air.While I encouraged them to produce a super-premium power supply (and charge more for it), Anker's commitment to customer communication is exemplary and gives me great confidence in purchasing their products in the future.

B00GTGETFG,A1DR5BZQ8HJUT0,M. Hadland,"[1, 2]","This charger has SMART technology. The 40W is shared amongst all the USB ports. You don't have to pick and choose what plugs into where; just plug in your devices and they will charge at the maximum rates their hardware allows. Other family-style chargers like this have limitations to the ports - certain ports can take certain devices or have current maximums. When I saw that this product came to market without those limitations, I clicked BUY and Amazon had it at my door two days later. I haven't looked back.I dispensed with my 12W iPad AC adapter, my adapter for my iPhone, and all the other wall chargers I had. I am using less wall outlets now. All I need is this Anker charger. As the manufacturer states, it's a little larger than a deck of cards. That's a wonderful tradeoff, however, because I don't need all those damn chargers now. I'm still calculating numbers, as I like to take samples and figure out charging rates, but suffice to say my iPad charges FAST with this.Right now, I have 4 of my work iPads plugged into the ports, just for heck's sake. iPad hardware requires 10W - 12W power to charge, each. There are 2 iPad 4s, and 2 iPad 3s all charging simultaneously, and I am getting normal charge messages on each!Considering how overpriced individual wall adapters are (up to $20 just for an Apple 12W iPad one), this Anker 5 port adapter was a great investment.

B00GTGETFG,A2TXR66RYK6C1,R. Burnthorn,"[1, 2]","I have been anxiously waiting for the Anker smart 40W/8A charger because of it's smart port technology, it would be perfect for my application with a mix of 2A and 1A charging needs. I have 2 Samsung Galaxy S3 phones (1 amp each), one Galaxy Note 8 Tablet (2 amps), one Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (Verizon 2 amps) and an Asus Vivotab Smart MC400 (2 amps). (2A x 3 + 1A x 2= 8A)Yes I realize that this is a lot of devices for one person to carry but some are for testing, others are for playing. I travel for a living and like having my toys to keep me from going stir crazy in a hotel room in the middle of winter. Simply put, carrying all the different charging modules is a pain let alone playing the ""plug in shuffle"" with the limited plugs available in a hotel room. With my application, it would be identical to a couple travelling with 1 child, each adult having a phone and tablet and the child having a tablet. A pretty typical situation for the standard family today.I began testing by plugging in all the devices and making sure that they all actively begin charging. They did. I then began testing against the original chargers that come with my Asus Vivotab smart, Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and galaxy note 8. All 2.0 Amp devices with their own max 2A chargers.My results are established from what is readily available to the common person without expensive monitoring equipment combined with a touch of common sense. The information below represents the Galaxy Note 10.1 Verizon SCH i925 (the most finicky and demanding of the 5) using battery monitor widget by 3c. The display is on, and the application to read the mA is open. The 7000Ah battery is at 92% and plugged into each perspective charger by themselves with no other devices or cables connected.Readings in charging mA in 2 minute intervals, the higher the number, the more power applied:Anker 40W  Samsung Charger+126............+151+138............+172+85.............+281+161............+217+108............+201+157............+265This is just a snapshot of the conditions stated above which would represent me in a hotel room after a day of heavy use, placing it on it's charger and actually using the device. This is a normal condition for me any maybe many others, using it while charging. As you can see, it keeps up with the demand of the device with a bit more to continue to charge. Not as good as the stand alone dedicated charging node, but effective.However, once I turn off the display, the charging rates spike up to +418 mA for the Anker 40W device and +493 for the Samsung Charger, so it is charging at it's max capability while at idle and the display turned off, which would represent coming home and plugging it in and walking away, letting it go into sleep mode and charging. This appears to be the optimal situation for the device and one that most people will likely utilize it for.With all of the devices plugged in, the display's turned off, and in their standby state, they all charge effectively at the Ankers max of 8A and bring them all to 100% with the charger remaining mildly warm and never feeling hot to the touch.If you have this many devices, then this will likely be the charger for you. I will be able to replace 5 dedicated charging nodes, a small 4 outlet extension cable, which combined takes up almost three times the space of the Anker travel charger, and keeps my bag less cluttered.So far I am very happy with the device based on my testing, and hope to have many years of service. They got this one right.

However, 1st port doesn't work and I cannot even do an exchange. Only a refund. So now I am right back where I started. Anker is usually good about products, but this one is unreliable.  Edit port #2 just went. Piece of junk. I don't know if it is a coincidence or not but now to ipod cables no longer work in regular chargers after using them in this.Edit: received second one which worked fine and then had 5th or 1st port die. No power to it.Anker gave me a credit on their own for the second one for a positive review before this issue...  Sorry, I can't do that Anker.....I received a white replacement free of charge from Anker. It came in a larger package with a few pamphlets about Anker products, etc. as well as the directions.The white model charges my note 2 faster than the black one ever did.I still have a black one, so I tried it the other night.  With using one of the few good ports, my battery charged from 28% to 51% in 7 hours..... Horrible.The white one on the other hand, went from 48% to 98% in about 3.5 hours, while also having an ipad 2 plugged in.  One star off because it doesn't seem to top off like a regular dedicated charger, but the white one is far superior to the black one and Anker support has been great.

B00GTGETFG,A1Q4DJKNW73AIZ,Xin,"[3, 5]","Wow!I was speechless when this came out, I swear Anker keeps outdoing themselves every time they release a new product.Too bad I have an addiction and always want to try the newest and the best. I have attached some pictures of the charger for everyone to see.Let me say that I was simply blown away and Anker definitely did not disappoint on this Wall Charger.The technology and design they put into this wall charger is unbelieveable for the low price. I've seen cheap, ugly, and big chargers go for much more.Anker's charger utilizes a simple wall plug that doesn't take up 2 or 3 spots. It is a simple removeable cable extension from the 5 port USB hub that only takes up 1 wall outlet. But it allows me to charge up to 5 devices. This one device alone saved me 4 slots on my surge protector and replaced 5 of my bulky ugly chargers. I had apple chargers, LG chargers, HP chargers, Samsung chargers and all other kinds of bulky wall chargers for my tablets and phones. They all had different amperage rating and were not interchangeable so I had to keep them all plugging in because it was a hassle to remove.Anker eliminated that problem as its charger has smart USB ports. Where past USB ports were hard-wired to exclusively charge iOS or Android, the Smart Port technology creates a truly universal charger. It dynamically adjusts to any device's unique maximum charging speed, the Smart Port takes the brainwork out of compatibility. So this worked with all my devices and no longer do I have to worry about plugging in my device to the right charger. It automatically gives my device the right amount of juice. It also uses top-grade microchips and built-in fail-safes by incorporating a unique port-level circuit protection system that shuts it down in the event of overvoltage, overcurrent, overheating or short circuits. It is truly a safe charger and a genius of a product with the Smart portsIt is a sleek matte finish and the charge can lie flat or standing up depending on how you want it. I have it on my dresser lying down so I don't know it over when I tug on the cables when I'm in a hurry. It's super sleek too and is about the size of a deck of playing card, I believe the dimensions are 3.6 x 2.3 x 1.0in. I love the sleek unibody design and the detachable power cable. It allows for easier storage, packing, and travel.Honestly, it was about time I got rid of all my different chargers. I'm glad Anker has pioneered this new Smart Port technology so I can do so. Never will I have to live with the trouble of finding a free outlet or the right charger for my tablet or smartphone depending on the manufacturer. All I have to do now is plug it in. Technology is supposed to make our lives simpler and this is exactly that the Anker Wall charger does.5 Stars from me. Good work Anker!
