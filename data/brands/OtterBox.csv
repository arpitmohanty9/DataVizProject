When I saw this come in for review I nearly did a dance for joy because, as we all know, they aren't cheap. These things are like armor for your phone. I have dropped my phone, sat on it, threw it and all kinds of stuff while it had an Otterbox on it and never had a scratched added to it.The problem with this &#34;Defender&#34; series is the screen protector portion. See, getting this thing apart to put it on requires supernatural skills - the same amazing skills are required to get it off once it's on your phone as well. So, yeah, before I could even get it apart to put it on the phone, my finger went through the screen protector, so that part was broken.It takes a little doing to get it on your phone. Maybe it's because I'm not actually a superhero, but after a little grunting and a lot of cursing, it was on. I snapped the screen on it and the rest of it and.... then decided to see how well I could get it off.Hahahahahaha... a bloody finger and more curse words later, it was off.It's on there now and I do have a regular peel and stick screen protector on it, so I never bothered to pick up one of the spares you can buy.It's a GOOD case, don't get me wrong. I have never used the clip that you can optionally use with it, but it looks like it's good quality as well.However, if you do not have Hulk hands, you might want to look at another Otterbox series. This one means business and I don't want to end up with stitches every time I need to open it up to take out a battery or whatever.So, I love Otterbox. I will continue to buy Otterbox. But I will NOT be buying this series. I'm also thinking that when I buy a new case, I should probably just buy a new phone too because I'm not sure I can get this thing off again. *laughing*Recommended for those that need series protection for their phones and don't have a need to swap the case or remove it.",3.0,1403740800,"06 26, 2014",Otterbox [Defender Series] Samsung Galaxy S5 Case - Retail Packaging Protective Case for Galaxy S5  - Neon Rose (Whisper White/Blaze Pink),47.3,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EsDA-fZHL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 15295},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies']]"

B000NLSGA2,A105L5EX9D0NH8,Dueces Wild,"[73, 77]","I was a little hesitant at first when ordering this case due to the fact that the defender cases have been super bulky in the past. Much to my surprise, Otterbox and their Defender Series Cases have come a long way since I contemplated ordering one a few years ago. This case is extremely thin for the protection it seems to offer. The build quality is superb and should protect the phone very well! I love the built in screen protector as opposed to trying to line up the sticky screen protectors with a few of the cheaper cases. The price seems fair as well. I paid $49.95 on Amazon. If ordered directly from Otterbox it will cost around $10 more.At the time of this post, the Lifeproof Case for the s5 has not been released. A huge deciding factor in choosing Otterbox over Lifeproof is the mixed reviews the s4 Lifeproof Case received about echoing when people try to talk to you.The belt clip seems to be nice and lock the case into place, but realistically I'll never use it. I keep my phone in my pocket. The buttons seem stiff, but from what I've read it's common at first on Otterbox cases.Overall, this case is a little pricey costing about 25% of the phone's cost after a contract renewal, but I feel it's definitely worth it (especially when you consider the alternative is paying full price for an s5 because yours broke in the middle of your contract). Lifeproof will cost you about $20-$30 more.I'll try to update this review accordingly as time progresses!*****UPDATE: 7/8/2014 - I've had this case for a little over 3 months now and I still really like it! I've only taken it off of my phone 1 time since purchasing (to clean the dust out and reset the phone by pulling the battery). It was very easy and quick to remove. This case has definitely protected my phone against my toddler's destructive ways on numerous occasions. The only problem I've noticed is that sometimes the case's buttons will slip off of the phone's buttons when I try to adjust the volume. It's not a big deal. I just hit the button again until it works correctly.The screen protector is still smooth and my finger is able to glide across it effortlessly, which is nice since I am addicted to my phone and use it almost nonstop.I've talked several coworkers and friends into purchasing this case.

B000NLSGA2,AE9QWJETO90U0,"Hasan al-Basri ""hasan""","[1, 1]","I've used Defender series cases on two Sammy S4s (mine and wife's) and my older 4th Gen Ipod Touch. I couldn't be happier with how they have worked. One minor flaw is that you have to be quite careful with the hard case snaps (slotted slip overs). They are easy to break. With such good luck on prior Defenders, I decided to get one when I upgraded to the Galaxy S5.The good news: same rugged quality of construction on the S5 Defender case.The REALLY good news: when I added the Samsung OEM wireless charging back cover, I managed (with some effort and a small compromise) to get the Defender case to fit over the slightly larger back cover. It isn't perfect, but it is serviceable. The snaps don't fully engage and there is a tiny separation at the bottom  (where the wired charging port connects), but, the case is held securely in place by the rubber/silicone wrap around. From the front, top, sides and back, the case looks like a perfect fit. All buttons and openings line up just as they should. Only by looking at the bottom do you notice the fit isn't perfect.The Bonus: The Samsung wireless charging adapter charges the S5 IN THE DEFENDER CASE!This is the unit I purchased on Amazon:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F358AVI/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1So, the combination of Otterbox Defender/Samsung Back Cover/Wireless Receiver/Samsung Wireless charger, work very well together, with the slight issue of the case not fitting perfectly, but workably.

It has complete protection for the screen and the phone itself without the need for a separate screen protector. The case has 3 components to it, the hard plastic inner shell which prevents any immediate damage to the phone itself. After the hard plastic casing is in place, the softer rubber part of the case fits over that and snaps into place better than some less expensive cases I've tried. The feel of the softer case is great, you will not feel like you will drop the case once this is installed. If you have small hands, and can hold the S5 by itself, with this case you may not. This case adds a lot of width to the S5, which was already a big phone and almost makes this as big as the Galaxy Note with this case on. I can still easily access the fingerprint scanner, camera, speaker and USB plug. The buttons remain responsive and easy to click on both sides. I use the headphone jack quite frequently, so I would have to assume that continually removing the flap to access the headphone jack might cause it to wear down over time. The front portion of the case has a significant border that keeps the phones screen from being anywhere near the surface underneath it, but again, this bulk is noticeable. I prefer to use a phone case that has a belt clip available and the belt clip that comes with this case is very sturdy. The phone clicks solidly into place and is unlikely to accidentally fall out while on a belt. Overall this case does have everything I'm looking for: protection, added grip, and a belt holster.

It is durable and provides very good protection for your iPhone without making it overly bulky like most ""armor"" cell phone cases do.I would suggest that once you get it, before you start messing with it, go to manufacturer's web site ([...]) and find this item, then clik VIDEO. This will play a YouTube video explaining how to take the case apart, install the iPhone, and put it all back together.Also, make sure to completely clean the screen of the iPhone, the inside of the screen protector of the case, and the external surfaces of the iPhone. With any luck you will never need to remove the iPhone again. I used a microfiber cloth intended to clean eyeglasses and it worked perfectly.I say 'almost perfect' in the title of this case because while using the belt clip as a desktop prop to landscape viewing (explained in the above-mentioned video) you can not connect the charging/sync cable. This is a small bummer, but not a big deal. If it were possible to give a rating of 4.9 stars I would have.Update: My current opinion after three months....Belt holster: Not very good. The phone comes out of it too easy as others have said.  I simply carry thing thing in my pocket.The case itself: I can't imagine carrying around my iPhone without it. It's been dropped to hard surfaces a number of times and the phone is still perfect.  The screen and the 'oil slick' problem: I figured the screen protector would get scratched up and whatnot eventually. So what I did was remove the iPhone from the case, then I puched on the screen protector from the front inward until it popped out. Then I took an exacto knife and scraped off the remaining glue residue from where the screen portector was glued in place. Then I bought a $10 kit of three adhesive screen protectors. these come in regular, anti-glare, privacy, etc. take your pick. Put the adhesive screen portector on the iPhone (after carefully cleaning the screen) then put the iPhone back in the case.  Using this method, if the screen protector gets crummy looking, you can always take the whole thing apart and put a new protector on.  I just did this screen protector replacement after three months constant use. The case was full of dust and lint, which cleaned-up well enough.  Once I wiped all the dust off the iPhone itself, it looked like it was brand freakin new. Pull off the old protector, put on a new one, reassemble the Otterbox, and I'm good for another three or four months.",5.0,1252627200,"09 11, 2009","OtterBox Defender Case for iPhone 3G, 3GS (Black)[Retail Packaging]",43.15,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pvwjCIuYL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 13537},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B001FVPU9O,A2FG90RW53W8WS,Hello,"[0, 0]","Screen:This is a great case and a great investment for you iphone!  We use this case to protect our iphone 3gs.  If you have ever put on a screen protector on the screen of a phone or other electronic and you do not get the air bubbles out, that is what the other viewers are describing.  However, after you purchase your case, go to an Apple Store and purchase an, ""anti-glare film set for iphone  3G/3GS"" screen protector.  The key is ""anti-glare""! Ask them to put it on your phone.  The young man took the phone out of the case, sprayed a cleaner on the screen and the otterbox screen.  I still saw the mark so he cleaned it again.  The cloth he used appeared to be the problem so I let him use the cloth that came with my sunglasses and that worked leaving no marks/air bubbles on the screen.  The screen is beautiful.  Do not get confused with the regular screen protectors for the iPhone because we had that on the phone prior to the anti-glare and it did not work because the mark was still on the phone.To sum it up, you will have two screen protectors on your phone, the anti-glare protector as well as the one that is on the otterbox.Model number of sorts is PIA-06E which may be the number for the original iphone as well as the 3g/3gs phone. If you have a 3g or 3gs iphone, make sure the front of the screen protector package reads, 3g/3gs because if you buy it without that specification on the front, then you will probably be buying the screen protector for the original iphone and that protector does not completely cover the 3g phones.You get two protectors that cover the 3gs phone well for 14.95.  It is made by power support.  It is sold on Amazon but as I stated I had great success with the Apple employee making the application.The belt clip/case that comes with the otterbox:In order for the phone to stay in the case, you MUST place the phone in the holder with the screen facing your body and the BACK of the phone facing away from the body.  If I were approaching you, I should be able to see the apple on the back of the phone and not the screen of your phone.  If you do so, there is not a problem with the case and the phone as well as the safety of the phone.Sound:We do not have any problems with hearing the phone ring or any of the sounds that the phone makes.Water protection:I was told from the employee at the apple store that if the phone encased with the otterbox drops in water, if the phone is recovered within 3 seconds, then the odds is that the phone will be okay.  That is, if you have all the openings closed on the phone.  Therefore, it is imperative that the cover openings remain closed on the case at all times.Iphone warranty:If you purchased the extended warranty the warranty extended or not will not cover the phone if the phone is dropped in water, if the screen breaks or if the screen is in a bunch of pieces.  Therefore, purchasing the otterbox is a no brainer!",5.0,1253923200,"09 26, 2009","OtterBox Defender Case for iPhone 3G, 3GS (Black)[Retail Packaging]",43.15,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pvwjCIuYL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 13537},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

Well, using the edge of the screen takes some getting use to since the case starts right at the edge, but you get used to that.  Other cases are slimmer fitting, but they don't offer this much protection.Also, charging, headphones and silent switch are buggers since they have covers you have to pull back to access.  I suppose you could take a razor knife and carefully cut these covers off if you want to.

A extremely lite dusting of baby powder dust on the inside of the membrane cures the water mark.

First, the good things: it offers excellent protection from drops, scrapes and the occasional rain storm. When your phone is clipped face-in on the belt clip it's pretty much impervious to most shock and any kind of screen damage.About the only thing it won't protect against is getting dropped in a body of water. It's water resistant, but NOT waterproof. Most of the phone is covered by plastic or silicone except for two holes on the bottom for the speakers, and a cloth cover over the part where you put your ear. I've had my iPhone in the Defender for about 3 months and it looks as shiny as the day I bought it.A few caveats: the plastic film that covers the screen has a weird oily ""pooling"" effect that's distracting. I've found that a light dusting of corn starch on the side that contacts the iPhone will get rid of it for a while.The silicone outer casing picks up dirt and lint like nobody's business. I have to wipe it down with a damp cloth several times a week or it's a phone-sized fuzzball. A minute in a blue jeans pocket will coat the thing. This is true for any case with this kind of non-shiny silicone though.The case adds a significant amount of bulk to the iPhone, so if you have small pockets or don't like the idea of clipping it to your belt all the time, look elsewhere.",3.0,1270598400,"04 7, 2010","OtterBox Defender Case for iPhone 3G, 3GS (Black)[Retail Packaging]",43.15,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pvwjCIuYL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 13537},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

They tried to sell me a screen protector (which is just a slate of static plastic cover on top of the glass) for 12 bucks.  12 bucks for a puny piece of rectangular plastic - ridiculous!  With this purchase I got the screen cover, a hard shell case, a rubber silicone cover.  Also, you get a belt clip that works just wonderful.All the controls of the iPhone are accessible while your phone is in th case.  The openings that are vulnerable to dust and liquid are sealed by the silicone plugs except the microphone and speakers which is obvious. By the way, the silicone case and the plugs are all in one single unit of construction, and so you don't have to worry about losing anything.  I would say that the case makes it water resistant, but not completely waterproof.  It will protect it from casual splashes of water but not if you happen to drop it in the pool or tub.* In regards to the problem about the watermark, the baby powder trick works! There are a lot of videos online that will show you how.  You will not be pouring the powder on your iPod or the screen case.  You just have to place and hold the baby powder on top of a table, put the case screen about 6 inches away, and then do a baby pump just enough to make a small puff of fairy dust.  And that's it.  You're done.A couple of cons:- This will double the thickness of your iPhone.- The only switch that is hard to reach while in the case is the lock button on the upper left.

I dismissed it the first couple times I was told about the echo. Blamed it on the wonderful AT&T service. However the complaints kept coming in and it got to the point callers were hanging up on me.

The belt clip DOES NOT HOLD THE PHONE SECURELY, so the belt clip is EXTREMELY prone to dropping the phone.In the six or eight months I've had the Otter case / belt clip, I've dropped my phone due to my own clumsiness ONCE, but the phone has hit the deck because this lousy belt clip dropped it maybe 99 times, including once in the toilet! Because the Defender CASE is so amazingly effective, my iPhone lives unscathed, with nary a scratch, but (oh the irony) the OtterBox BELT CLIP is by far the single greatest threat that my iPhone faces. The BELT CLIP warrants NO STARS, zero, zip, nada, nil.The design of this belt clip is simply a failure. First of all, unless everything is absolutely perfect, the Defender case does not ""snap in"" to this belt clip. If any part of (sides or bottom) the Otter Defender silicone cover is not perfectly fit onto the case and properly closed up, or if any small bit of your clothing fabric gets into the mix, the phone will not ""lock"" as it goes in to the belt clip. Since THERE IS NO ""FEEDBACK"" as to whether it's ""locked in"" the only way you find out it's not locked in is when the phone falls on the ground or floor (or in the water). Even when it does snap in, it's not a very strong hold, so any very significant jolt or bump or movement or any halfway decent excuse and this worthless belt clip will drop your $5-6-7-800  worth of iPhone careening onto the concrete. Finally, the clamp that actually clips the holder onto your pants has a ""locked open"" setting. I have no idea what positive purpose of this design was intended for, but in practice, it tends to lock open when you do NOT want it open as you are bending and moving and so forth, so again, the whole thing is likely to drop off your waist and (again) hit the ground.I strongly recommend the Otter Defender case, but think people should know that the belt clip that comes with it works to the exact opposite direction of protection.

Plastic outer shell makes the Commuter Case much easier to slip in and out of holsters - while leaving the rubber shell sufficiently exposed to facilitate a secure grip.4.  Aesthetics:  Impressive.  Elegant.5.  Protection:  I don't care to put my BB to the test.  (Let's just say that without the OtterBox, I was worried about dropping the slick BB.  With the Otterbox, it inspires confidence.  From the moment I pull it out of my holster, it just feels so good.)  I'm sure the OtterBox Defender is better at protection, but I'm very happy with the balance between protection and low profile that the OtterBox Commuter provides.6.  Price Point:  At $20+, I think it is a good value.7.  Size:  With protection comes some bulk.  For me, the approximately 2mm thickness of the case is just right.  For others, especially those who have a specific hoster in mind, the added thickness may not be acceptable.  (See my other reviews for one case that I altered to fit.)8.  Plastic Shield:  Unknown.  Installed easily.  So far it works okay.  Only time will tell about its durability.Bottom line:  An excellent product for those interested in protecting their Blackberry Curve.  Highly recommended.EDIT:  Two months later and I'm still pleased as pie with the Commuter case.

The actual case looks so much better. The rubber sleeve is very soft and moldable and the hard plastic back clip is really well made and sturdy enough to hold the rubber sleeve perfectly in place.

B002PK13G8,A2F1ACZTJF30CN,Ben C.A. Nettle,"[3, 4]","I got this case for my wife's iPhone, as I had already purchased the black commuter and really liked it.  The Green case is very similar, and aside from color, the only real difference seems to be the ""dimples"", like a golf ball, in the green silicone wrap portion.  My wife enjoys the color, as its a very ""cute"" green.  The rest of the review is very similar to that of the black case I have:The Commuter consists of 3 parts, a screen protector (applied with an applicator to 'try' to smooth out the bubbles), a silicon sleeve to protect the sides and back from drops and impacts, and frame / metal wrap to keep the silicon sleeve in place.Overall, the pieces and parts work well to protect the phone from scratches, dings, and most importantly drops. Additionally, since most of the ports are well protected, small splashes haven't seemed to hurt it at all, even though it doesn't claim waterproof abilities.Another nice thing about this case is that it adds very little in the way of size. The iPhone is a fairly good sized phone to begin with, but this case is a very small addition and the protection is well worth it. The buttons are all easy to press with the case on, and the speakers still provide close to the same sound (from what I can tell).The only reason I've given this a 4 instead of a 5 is because sometimes the case tries to slip from the edges occasionally, and the covers for the ports can sometimes be a pain to get back into place. Overall though, I can't complain and have been very happy with its level of protection and small size.",4.0,1261958400,"12 28, 2009",OtterBox iPhone 3G / 3GS Commuter TL Series Case,29.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510aB9pZTSL._SX342_.jpg,,OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B002PK13G8,A1YFVFQEAPP5UO,Christopher Cerrudo,"[437, 439]","I have the Defender as well, and the Commuter gives a nice, in-between product between the Impact and the Defender. My review will really focus on the Defender vs the Commuter:The Defender has a polycarb frame surrounded by silicon, plugs the docking port, headphone port, and volume and sleep button. It also covers the screen with a clear protective layer. This is a very protective case, while not waterproof it's pretty much impervious to everything else. However, this protection adds heft to the phone, and the raised edges can make it difficult to get to the letters on the edges of the screen.The Commuter has a silicon wrap that is protected by a polycarb frame around it. The screen protection is provided by a screen protector that is applied to the surface, with a slot for the speaker and a cutout for the home button. There is a plug around the headphone jack as well as the docking port. The volume and sleep buttons are protected, but the mute switch is open. However, the slim form is maintained, and there is no problem getting to the edges of the keyboard.When I had the Defender case on my phone, I had a hard time dropping it into my pocket and retrieving it because of the additional heft. No such problem with the Commuter. With the polycarb frame around the silicon, it also kept the phone from ""sticking"" to the sides of my pockets, which the Defender tended to do.The Commuter will be a nice compromise for those that don't want the additional heft of the Defender case, yet want the Otterbox type of protection for their iPhones.",4.0,1255305600,"10 12, 2009",OtterBox iPhone 3G / 3GS Commuter TL Series Case,29.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510aB9pZTSL._SX342_.jpg,,OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

You can't really see it in the pictures, but the silicone part of the case has covers for almost all of the openings (not over the camera or speakers- duh-, and not over the silence switch).

I dropped my phone several times in that one and it came to no harm. It has this waffle like texture that provide the impact protection (if you believe them) and this case has them to but to a lesser degree making me think it is not as protected as in that case along with the fact that the silicone stops right at the edge of your chrome bezel.Unlike the impact case and every other silicone case I have tried, this case does not have the grippy qualities that make it impossible in a pocket and does not attract lint as much either.

It is less slippery than the iphone itself though.Specs say that it is the same size as Otterbox Impact but it feels smaller to me.The plastic shield takes some maneuvering to get on since it likes to deform the silicone but I have not wanted to take it off since I got it.It has plugs covering all the holes which is an added bonus however the plug covering the dock connector which folds back easily when it is time to connect to the dock or charger, is a little bit in the way and makes it hard to seat on my dock and even when I do get it seated it will push itself loose.

B002PK13G8,A2OTLOW1BSB90M,Ricochet,"[1, 1]","This is my first otter case.  The concept and design are pretty good.  I have owned 2 Speck Candy shell cases previously and both have served me well.  They offer superior protection due to their hard plastic covering which protects all 4 corners of the phone as well as the back - fully covered except for the camera hole.  The design does not interfere with keyboard access or cause the edge of a screen protector to pop up.So why did I switch?The speck is a one piece design and remarkable, except for one thing.  The thin portion of the frame near the bottom of the phone's face eventually cracks and then breaks off over time.  The case remains fully functional and still offers great protection, but you have a broken case that eventually becomes a bothersome eyesore.The Commuter case is a compromise for me. It's slightly slimmer than a speck and is comfortable to hold.  It offers good protection, but not the same level afforded by a case that has a rigid shell at all four corners.  If the commuter case had this, it might be 4 stars.  The commuter is not the case you want to rely on to protect your phone in case of a fall.  On to carpet, no problem.  On the cement, you might need a new screen.  No one plans to drop their phone, but accidents do happen.  If the need arose, I don't see myself buying another commuter case.  I'd have to opt for something with a little more protection in the corners.  The Otter defender series or another brand altogether.Update - After 3 months of ownership I will be going in another direction.  The case does offer a medium amount of protection, but the rubber flaps that cover the plugs for the headphones and charge/sync port are a pain to deal with.  Fumbling to plug in while driving and/or docking to charge the phone at night.Final update: Lowering my review to 2 stars.  Look elsewhere for good 3GS protection and ease of use.  The case is comfortable to hold, and offers a basic level of protection, but the speck is better all the way around, even after the frame breaks.

B003UC8RVE,A22K36X80X815R,"Abe Vigoda ""part-time inventor""","[1, 1]","First off, to all you people reading the bad reviews first (like I do), I say - DO NOT BELIEVE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS.Here's what happened to me... I purchased the iPhone4 within the first month of it's being available and immediately noticed that the reception was bad. People couldn't hear me talking to them and calls were dropped on a regular basis. But I kept ""4"" because it is marvel of modern engineering and beautiful to look at and a wonder to hold.Besides, texting is the new talking and I needed a mini-computer on my persons at all times.  So, I purchased a cheap temporary case which I promptly returned after Apple sent me the free bumper I ordered.The bumper is very minimalist so I can still appreciate the phone's good looks and the quality of it's calls quickly improved- not one dropped call when the ""4"" is encased.  I was happy.  Until the small scratch I discovered right on the Apple logo one day!  Then, it suddenly hit me- ""THIS PHONE IS MADE OF GLASS, back and front, AND I AM GOING TO HAVE TO PROTECT IT!""  I knew that just one-drop at a bad angle at which the glass comes into contact with the sidewalk and it would be all over. Even if the phone continued working, I wasn't going to walk around with a phone bearing a cracked display. YUCK!Hence the search for the very best case for my iPhone began. First I went to Bestbuy to visually inspect and physically handle some cases.  I saw that only the Defender blocked the dock opening which is important for me since that opening allows dust and debris to enter too easily. Then I spent hours on amazon looking at and reading about 4 different suitable cases.Instinctively, I knew that the Defender was what I NEEDED but I thought that it would be absolutely sacrilege  to cover-up the 4's beauty. I turned to reading all the reviews on amazon, starting with the negative ones- like I always do. What I read disturbed me.  People were saying that the case makes the iPhone too bulky to hold, that it attracts dust like a magnet, even going so far as to state that that it couldn't fit in ones pocket!  Well, because of those negative people I held-off on getting the Defender for about 2 weeks even though I knew that only it would offer me the piece of mind I so desperately needed.The Defender was added to ""my cart"" on amazon and I mulled it over in my mind.  On the same day on which ""my cart"" informed me of a price drop, I said ""What the hell, I can always return it"" and ordered it.I am now whole and all is well with the world.Here are the...PROS:1- The ""4"" is now very well protected. Front, back, sides, top and bottom. Everything. A see-thru layer of plastic protects front from scratches. Flip-down rubber hatch protects the dock entrance on the bottom. Rubber hatch protects the headphones port on top when not in use. You just lift it when needed, which is great because now even thick plugs will fit, unlike with the bumper that I was using before. Protection for the volume button and the power button is built-in, molded into the case design. One last hatch on the side protects the silent/vibration switch.2- Speaker, microphone, camera, flash, and sensor are unaffected but well protected.3- The holster is very well made and holds the phone securely. You can hold the phone with the screen showing or flipped over. I don't use headphones often because I like to keep my ears open to other sounds as well, so I sometimes holster the iphone with the screen showing(so that I can use it without unholstering it) and the speaker pointed up towards my ears and listen to my podcasts and multitask.And the CONS:1- If you keep it in your pocket, then yes, the silicone will attract lint- ie: ""pocket debris"".2- This case will double the thickness of the ""4""  (But it will be well protected and I noticed that it now feels better in my hand. The chances of my dropping it now are slim to none!)3- There is no instruction booklet explaining how to get it on to your phone, only a diagram on the inside of the packaging which lays it out for you in a too-simple kinda way.Warning: Do it right the first time. If you aren't ""mechanically inclined"" then get someone who is - to get this IRON MAN case around your ""4"".And there you have it, 2 hours of my time spent ranting about my experiences.So, if you feel you need this level of protection then just get it.  You will get used to the size very quickly.",5.0,1286582400,"10 9, 2010","OtterBox Defender Case for iPhone 4 (Black, Retail Packaging, Fits AT&amp;T iPhone)",39.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZxKiCVTML._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 14148},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

I received the case on Friday and I must admit, it did not disappoint.First impressions:  The case is of great quality and a lot of detail went into making it compatible with all the OEM ""accessories"".  The holster is among the best I've seen for a phone of this size and works perfectly with the case.After carrying it for two days (and this is already my 3rd iPhone 4 case - I am rough on my phones):  The case is without a doubt the most durable I've seen for the iPhone 4 and lives up to the reputation that Otterbox has built over the years.Cons:  The case does add considerable bulk to the phone and may not be perfect for pocket carriers.  It does include a holster which works great and can rotate for vertical or parallel carrying of the phone.Miscellaneous:  I have no complaints really, but I am left to wonder if the silicone ""flaps"" that cover the earphone and USB plug-ins could have been a little more user-friendly.  Sometimes they are frustrating to get back into their proper ""closed"" position.Edited one month after using:  I am still extremely happy with the case.  I have dropped my phones a few times already and though the case is starting to show signs the abuse I have provided it the phone still looks pristine!  I opened up the case this morning to clean the phone etc and to my surprise there wasn't much to clean.  With cases I've owned in the past I would have a forest of lint, dust etc. that would trap itself between the case and the phone.  The Otterbox has minimized that debris!I am uploading several photos showing the difference between a ""bare"" iPhone 4 and an iPhone 4 in the Defender case so everyone can get an idea of how much ""protection"" and in turn ""bulk"" this case adds to the phone.Edited to add:  Amazon removed my pictures when the placed the phone back in a ""pre-order"" status, I will re-upload them again once they allow.

I used the Otterbox Defender for my iPhone 3G and loved it.  It provided the kind of protection that I needed for my phone since I was kind of rough on them.  But with the earlier Defender case, I found some issues related to the screen and some of the port covers (mainly the charger port). This new case resolves them all.  I'm happy that the Otterbox company listened and responded with this new design.  It's beautiful, functional, practical -- and for all of the protection it provides from lumps and bumps, it is well worth any extra bulk that you may perceive.For the 3-layered protection that the Otterbox Defender provides for the new iPhone 4, one would expect a lot more bulk.  Not so, it's one of the beautiful things about these cases.  Each layer fits perfectly on top of the other one.  The silicone is engineered to hug every bevel on the plastic inner case.  Both layers give complete access to all of the new button and camera configurations.  So well engineered that you can tell the case was made with thought and complete precision.  You may see knock-offs (as I have), but the real deal is worth the money.There are a couple of things I noticed comparing this new Defender to the former 3G / 3GS Defender case:- the screen protector seems to have been fixed so that the ""oil bubbles"" won't appear.  I had the bubbles right out of the box for the former version.  Seems like they fixed something or changed a material or coating.  I'll update if anything to the contrary happens.  No fingerprints on the screen cover either!  How do they do that?- the holster (which I never really use, honestly) makes getting the phone in and out of it a snap (literally).  The holster is good because it doubles as a dock or easel to watch videos, etc.  This new design clips in from the side and can snap in facing front or back with no qualms.  No hard fussing with this one.- the iPhone and case fit easily in a pocket or purse and don't add extra bulk (not like you would imagine).  The silicone is made in such a way where it is not the sticky kind of silicone (the cheaper stuff that smells and has a gripping quality to it).  This has no odor and easily slips out of a pocket (I saw a comment on the other review so I thought I would answer it).- the port for the charger on the new Otterbox Defender can now accommodate non-OEM chargers with wider connectors (the older one could not).  This was a hassle with non-OEM car chargers.  This is no longer a problem.  FIXED.- One potential issue is although I like the patterned back (little etched diamonds), I imagine that these could be a harbinger of dust or dirt.  It's easily cleaned though (just wipe it with a cloth or on your shirt sleeve).  Time will have to tell on this design decision.I'm a fan of the Otterbox and bought one originally because of sheer clumsiness.  For an expensive device like an iPhone, it's worth the protection.  I was initially intimidated from the case thinking it was going to be far too clunky.  Not so.  Like the iPhone 4 the Otterbox Defender iPhone 4 case shares the same aesthetic lines.  If you have never owned a case like this before, installing the iPhone into it might take one look at directions.  If you've used them before, it's the same type of clamshell/snap and silicone slip-on design.It's a tough little case in a nice looking package.  I truly appreciate the precise engineering that goes into the creation of Otterbox products, this company does what they do very well!5 stars!",5.0,1279929600,"07 24, 2010","OtterBox Defender Case for iPhone 4 (Black, Retail Packaging, Fits AT&amp;T iPhone)",39.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZxKiCVTML._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 14148},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

I took it with me on my honeymoon in Mexico and dropped it a bunch of times and never had to worry about it. However there are some drawbacks to it. I have had to make some modifications to my otterbox. First of all the screen protector scratched several times and started to degrade my screen quality so I removed it by popping it out. Luckily I had a new replacement Zagg screen protector that I placed on the phone after I removed the Otterbox screen. So I'm using the Zagg with the otterbox screen protector removed and I noticed that the screen quality is much better now. However the new drawback is that a little dirt can now enter from around the screen but its not big problem because a little dirt always got in anyways. Another drawback is that the bottom back cover that has the missing cloth felt seems to scratch up against the bottom of my iphone 4. So I also added the Zagg cover to the back. It's a tight fit with the Zagg on the front and back and this tends to leave indentations on the Zagg in the areas that the Otterbox is pressing tight against it, but you can't see the indentation unless you take out the iphone. The whole point is to protect the phone so I don't mind messing up the Zagg in the process.The last modification I had to make really gets on my nerves. I started to notice the silicone was getting really loose on my phone. I didn't feel as solid as before. You could feel the plastic hard case move around a lot and the sides of the silicone would come off all the time. I tried to shrink the silicone by putting it in the freezer, this only worked for a few hours then it would expand again. So I rolled up several pieces of regular scotch tape and placed it on the outer back and sides of the plastic hard case to add some bulk to it. Now the silicon fits tighter again and I have extra padding in between the silicon and that plastic incase I drop it again.  I don't like the idea of knowing that I had to use tape to create bulk to the phone. Other than all of these improper modifications that I had to make, the Otterbox still protects my phone and I now have a clearer screen than before and my silicon fits much better than before.",3.0,1288310400,"10 29, 2010","OtterBox Defender Case for iPhone 4 (Black, Retail Packaging, Fits AT&amp;T iPhone)",39.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZxKiCVTML._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 14148},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

Perhaps they rushed this one into production.The textured back, while cool looking, does turn into somewhat of a dust trap, and you have to either take the case off and wash it off with water, or get a tooth brush (or something similar) to brush all the dust off. The flaps that cover the headphone jack, charger opening, and vibrate switch often come undone. I seem to remember the 3G covers being more like plugs that stayed in place. The defender for the iPhone 4 has these little flaps with a very small and often ineffective tongue & groove system to hold them in place.Overall I'm satisfied with the purchase and the case provides ample protection against casual drops. But as I said earlier, I just don't think it is as protective as the previous defender case was. My friends would often intentionally toss their 3G phones across the room to demonstrate the effectiveness of their Defender case. I'm not as confident in this one.",4.0,1284336000,"09 13, 2010","OtterBox Defender Case for iPhone 4 (Black, Retail Packaging, Fits AT&amp;T iPhone)",39.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZxKiCVTML._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 14148},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

The problem with most belt carriers is that the case will frequently slip off the belt, particularly after arising from a sitting position, sending the case and iphone ignominiously to the floor. The Defender holster has a lip at the bottom of the belt clip that has largely prevented such suicidal leaps in the month I have owned it.The case does bulk up the slim iphone4, but fits well and seems to provide ample protection. The controls and ports are readily accessible. The touch screen works well through the cover that is integral to the case. The phone fits securely in the holster, but can be quickly removed from it.There are some minor concerns. A little dust has somehow migrated through the openings into the case. There is a hole in the earphone flap, of dubious purpose, that doesn't line up with the earphone receptacle on the phone; even if it were aligned, the thick flap would prevent seating of most plugs. However, simply flipping up the flap provides excellent access to the socket. The flap covering the connector on the bottom of the phone is diffiult to close, and does not appear destined for a long life. The belt clip, of excellent design and function, does not appear particularly sturdy, and may also be foredoomed to a truncated existence. Thus the four star, rather than five star, rating seems appropriate.Overall I am very satisfied, to this point, with the Otterbox Defender for my iphone4.",4.0,1294444800,"01 8, 2011","OtterBox Defender Case for iPhone 4 (Black, Retail Packaging, Fits AT&amp;T iPhone)",39.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZxKiCVTML._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 14148},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

The phone is placed in the first two pieces front and back, which literally snap together.

That was the reason I waited months for its release and why it is still on my phone.I am disappointed that this one does not match up with the quality of its predecessors.  You can feel the phone slipping inside the plastic case.  The plastic is much thinner and lesser quality compared to the 3GS OB Defender.  I also do not believe that this case could withstand the abuse I have witnessed people putting the 3GS Defender through.Over the last several weeks, I have seen the silicon outer cover begin to buckle around the Home button from lifting the bottom to charge the phone.  The top flap for the head phone jack is also causing buckling at the top of the screen.PROS:1) Solid protection.  I threw it across my office without fear to demonstrate the protection to a coworker considering a case purchase for an iPhone 4.2) The holster is great.  Makes a nice stand for viewing movies in flight.CONS:1) Buckling of the silicon in multiple locations only seems to be getting worse with use.2) Bulky.  Does not fit in a pocket easily with this case on.  Not a huge deal for the protection but worth noting.3) Flaps for charging and headphone jack are difficult to put back in place and get a ""seal"".I got a killer deal on my Defender through Amazon.

I have had this case for a week and still can't determine what those features might be. After using Body Glove cases for years, their QC has declined and my only Otter Box (Defender for iPhone) was superb.What this case does well, it does really well but what it lacks is so sorely lacking that it makes one wonder what the designers were thinking. For example, the obvious point is protection. The two areas least needing the bulk of protection are the most attended to by this case.The back and the areas around the bottom front are protected by thick silicone with the back receiving both the best of the silicone and the hard shell. The areas most fragile in the Droid's design, the screen and speaker areas are virtually unprotected.While I received a case that the port covers fit perfectly on, the narrow lip around the screen proper puckers up 1/16th to almost 1/8th of an inch from contacting the surface. It's nice to have the ports covered but there is enough room for dirt, liquid or debris to enter from the screen area to negate any protection.The choice of the plastic shell areas of coverage are dubious as well. As mentioned, the back gets the lions share with half coverage of the bottom corners and the sides. The back does overlap the top but stops before getting near the fragile speaker and its accent trim area.I really wanted to like this case as my cell phone is my life-line living alone so protecting it is critical to me. The lack of coverage of the most vulnerable areas of the Droid makes this a ""why bother"" item. I have never returned an item to Amazon but with it boasting all the features one would expect in a 3 dollar case, I will eat the shipping and return this $26.50 (that includes shipping) item for another Body Glove.The Body Glove makes no pretense of being anything other than a hard shell but despite QC issues, it remains a valid case for it's 10 dollar price range while this unit isn't acceptable by any Otter Box standards I have ever seen.",2.0,1311379200,"07 23, 2011",OtterBox Motorola Droid X Commuter Series Case,39.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41aD%2BFoSbZL._SX342_.jpg,,OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B0047VB69C,AAAS37Z87F1UF,project_aye,"[0, 0]","Let me start off by saying I am outright happy with my purchase.  However, that isn't to say that the case is without its flaws.  But let's start with one thing at a time.  First, I want to dispel certain things.  When I first saw the picture, I thought that the case would make my phone unbearably bulky, and that simply isn't the case.  Yes, it will be thicker, but it still fits comfortably in my pocket.  If anything, the added heft of it makes it easier for me to hold in my hand comfortably (I find a naked Captivate to feel slippery and too small and slight). But let's go into the pros and cons:PROS-Added heft makes the phone easier to hold-The textured under-surface feels great in your hand-The silicone is good quality (when compared w/ cheap silicone) and seldom feels slippery.  Instead, it maintains a very consistent amount of grip.-The shield/plastic case part clips securely-Shield doubles as a stand-Looks and feels great in your hand-The case clips well to the shield/coverCONS-Angle of stand is awkward and doesn't facilitate use or viewing very well-Thickness of case and shield is quite large (but realistically, w/ the clip, you wouldn't be putting it in your pocket-Plastic cover over the camera gets lint stuck under it quite readily-Silicone material does gather ""gunk"" quite readily, but that's to be expected as the material has a degree of ""grip""-Bottom touch buttons are a little harder to press as the way the frame is cut tapers so as to obscure the buttons partially.  People with large hands may have a genuinely frustrating time accessing buttons.-After dropping my phone with it, the left side of the case repeatedly clicks when I grip it.  At first a minor annoyance, it has become rather noticeable and annoying.  It appears to be a result of the pieces no longer fitting together perfectly any more.-The buttons require a moderate deal of pressure to activate.  It's a slight difference, but definitely noticeable (unlike other otterbox products like the Xoom case).Though it seems that more cons were listed than pros, I don't want anyone to think that I regret getting this product.  It's a matter of being able to say specifically what is ""wrong"" with the product, but it does so much right, and so simply, there's not much to say.  It's a great cover/case, the absolute best of the 3 I've owned prior to finally deciding to splurge on it, and overall, the cons are small compared to the pros.",4.0,1311984000,"07 30, 2011",OtterBox Samsung Captivate Defender Case,39.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41kmQOHWOZL._SX342_.jpg,,OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B004AJ8PG8,A2KTRO275LJY1R,"A. J. Abadsafian ""Persian""","[1, 1]","As the iPhone 4 comes out for Verizon, many manufacturers are scrambling to make cases that will protect our precious electronic gems. However, there are very few cases currently on the market that are tailored towards Verizon's iPhone 4. This Otterbox case is not one of them.Thought the description claims its a universal case (""OtterBox At&T; and Verizon iPhone 4 Commuter case""), its just like the At&T; version specific model. I went to Best Buy to try on the Commuter series and was told that they only had the At&T; version. It had fit in the store, except the silence/sound button on the side of the phone was covered partially by the rubberized molding of the case. I debated whether or not I could live with this- as this was the only issue with the OtterBox case. Then I saw the listing on Amazon saying that it would fit for Verizon iPhones as well. SAME EXACT PRODUCT. There is no difference from this product you are buying, and the At&T; OtterBox case I tried at Best Buy! They both cover the silence/sound button on the side of my phone which can get annoying after a while.Now as for the case itself...I like OtterBox and I heard they have a real nack for making sturdy, reliable cases for apple products. Hearing positive review after positive review (and word-of-mouth) I decided to purchase the Commuter case.On the plus side:The case is strong. I dropped my iPhone from an elevation of 5 feet (burned my hand on a stove and dropped the iPhone with the other) and it landed on its corner as it hit the hard wood floor. I expected the screen to have a large crack in it. But true to its positive reviews- it had no damage to it at all. Impressive.The case offers two layers of protection; rubberized mold and a plastic encasing. And it has a protective felt liner around the camera hole so the case doesn't scratch the lens of the phone. Also very nice.The face of the iPhone screen is protected by raised edges of the rubber case. You can lay the phone face down and not scratch the screen because the raised edges keep it from making direct contact on the glass screen.The negatives:There is a user-submitted image that points to the top of this case (the plastic part) having a small small space between it and the rubber mold. Though this doesn't look awful (its hardly noticeable), it rubs against the ear, aggravating it. The plastic edge of the case kept pinching my ear every time i speak on the phone and up until now I thought it was the screen protector I put on. Hardly.Secondly, the case collects a lot of dust around the edges and picks up a lot of lint from jean pockets. This is a minor issue and not one that really bothers me.It is not as thin as say, Incipio's line of Verizon iPhone cases (which use the same design structure as OtterBox), but it protects the iPhone, looks amazingly stylish, and is the best case on the Verizon iPhone market as it stands. I highly recommend this product. Even with its minor flaws, it does not fail in: minimizing the added weight to the phone, offering the best protection for its size case, its reliability. A great quality case and decent enough price until something better comes out!I hope this helps.*** 6/07/2011Still using the case and I've got to say, I made it 4 stars from 3 because I dropped my phone countless times and EVERY SINGLE TIME it landed out of harm's way! Nothing was damaged and my baby was still flawless and functional. Very shocked at how such a case can protect so sophisticated a phone, but I have more respect for it now! I like that it has covers for audio port and charge port- this prevents dust and moisture from collecting!

With that said, I have often found Otterbox products to be the best of the best.

Unfortunately my excitement quickly subsided.  I hate to sound negative but this case leaves a lot to be desired.

It often protrudes from the case and just looks awkward.In conclusion I would state that though the case isn't the worse (and 2 stars may be harsh) due to the price and quality expected from Otterbox it came up well short of expectations.I will try to post pictures later showing this case next to a bare iPhone 4 and also next to the Defender case.",2.0,1283040000,"08 29, 2010",OtterBox Commuter Series Hybrid Case for AT&amp;T and Verizon iPhone 4 (Purple/White) (Doesn't support iPhone 4S),34.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413WDwYHPwL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 62936},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"
B004AJ8PG8,A1EPF7M167VL22,Dalton Grisham,"[0, 0]","It has been a lot of searching, and a lot of money...but I think I finally found it! This case (black) is the perfect fit for my Verizon iPhone 4. After much searching and purchasing (some not fitting to some breaking very easily), this case seems to be the best fit, most durable, and best looking of the cases I have purchased.First let me start off by saying I did NOT follow the directions to install this case...because for me at least that did not work at all. Instead, when installing this case; put the hard shell and rubber shell together (before putting it on the phone), then slip the phone into the shell. Yes it's a bit awkward to put in, but at least it fits. If you want...I can post a video or instruction on how to do this...just comment below.The case is very durable, you can tell by the build, and it has been tested. I dropped this case a few times, and unlike my in-case, it does not drop on first contact. The case feels strong, and the rubber flaps are also an added bonus. Although its nice that the case came with screen protectors, I do not see the need as the case feels sufficient enough (can't say that about my old case I have a scratch in the screen form drop).Another aspect I enjoy about this case is the fit. Many people complained about the fit...so I was VERY hesitant. However after the instructions I briefly mention, there are NO open spots, or loose fits. The bottom takes some pushing to get the flap in to cover the charge port, but nothing too strenuous. It is a much better fit than the case mate pop I previously owned. The phone also fits in my iHome (just takes a little moving around), and my car mount.Lastly, the cosmetic appeal of this case is what I would consider to be; strong, bold, and name brand. When people see otter-box they generally know its a great brand. The look is plain, with some features that make it stand out a bit. I was not crazy about the apple cut out in back...but it's a trade off well worth taking.In conclusion...buy this case...sure it's a risk, but better than the other wastes of money cases that I bought.

B004AJ8PG8,A1T2ZO4ARVSUGE,"D. Greenbaum ""DoctorDave""","[3, 3]","iPhone cases seem to come in two different varieties: fashionable lightweights which look nice but provide poor protection and larger cases that add protection along with bulk.  Personally I prefer function over form (Otterbox Defender!) but the Commuter is an excellent compromise that adds style and protection without a great deal of bulk.Unlike it's beefier sibling, the Commuter's rubber sleeve is is banded by a smooth plastic shell, which allows theCommuter to easily slide in and out of one's pocket. The case is actually two parts, a thin rubber piece which wraps over most of thephone, providing shock protection, and then the aforementioned plastic piece, which slides over the back of the phone vertically as a band, providing further protection. Finally, there is a screen protector, which must be manually applied and is prone to bubbling. All together, these provide three layers of protection.In daily use, the case provides fine protection against the usual hazards of iPhone ownership, such as pocket junk, random bangingagainst other objects, and sliding across tables, and it's dual layer protection is superior to the high fashion cases.  Although, I didn't actually test intentionally dropping the phone, based on the construction of the case, I am pretty confident it would survive a short fall onto a hard surface unless you got unlucky enough to have something impact the front glass.  I had enough close encounters with my iPhone 3GS and Commuter to trust Otterbox's design.What are the downsides of the Commuter? Well, just like the Model T, you can have the Commuter in any color you like, as long as it isblack. I was disappointed in the lack of any color options, but this may not be a big deal to many people and I'm sure Otterbox will develop more colors later on. Another negative was the slim flap which protects the dock connection; although a good idea intheory, the flap often comes loose and ends up just being annoying. Finally, the areas where the edges of the rubber of the case touchedthe phone (such as around the screen and the mute switch) seemed to become dust magnets, although to be fair, many rubber cases have the same issue.Overall, the Commuter is a great balance of protection in a lightweight design that easily slides in and out of your pocket.  For my spouse the protection the Commuter offers is ""just right"" -  more protection than the ""free cases"" Apple offered, with a minimal amount of bulk.  If the Otterbox iPhone 4 case was a car, the Commuter would be the luxury sedan while the Defender is a tank.  Not everyone wants to drive a tank to work.Pros:  A perfect balance of form and function and superior 3-layer protectionCons:  Lack of color choices, average manual screen protectionRating  4.5 out of 5.0",4.0,1288483200,"10 31, 2010",OtterBox Commuter Series Hybrid Case for AT&amp;T and Verizon iPhone 4 (Purple/White) (Doesn't support iPhone 4S),34.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413WDwYHPwL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 62936},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B004AJ8PG8,AJ29BI9RO7F40,Greg,"[3, 6]","I just got this case a few days ago, and I really like it. It doesn't make the phone too bulky, and the smooth plastic on most of it (as opposed to being mostly or all silicone) makes it so that it still slips into your pocket instead of catching on the fabric. Some other reviewers say the screen protector isn't up to par, but I strongly disagree with that. Every screen protector I've ever seen or used on other people's iPhone's make the screen feel either like cheap plastic or it makes the screen feel rubberized. With this screen protector, it still feels like smooth glass. I did go up to Best Buy and have them install the protector, which they did free of charge.

B004AJ8PG8,AIXTKOGCVXQUH,John Rawlins,"[139, 145]","Hi, I just got this case yesterday.  It's the third one I've tried with my iPhone 4.  Otterbox makes fine cases so I expected something nice and was not disappointed.  I also had the Commuter and Defender cases for my iPhone 3Gs.Here are some notes for you:- The case provides the best protection of the three I've tried.  The Apple bumper case is nice but the open back leaves a lot of glass exposed.  This one gets the job done while not being too bulky.- Compared to the iPhone 3Gs Commuter case this one exposes more of the hard plastic surface and less of the rubber.  The plastic is textured nicely so gripping is still secure.  In all fairness I think I do prefer the design of the 3G/3Gs version.- The phone will connect (Yeah!) to my Magellan car mount and B&W; speakers with this case.  It would not connect with the thicker Apple bumper case.  I'm also able to get other cables to connect to it that would not connect with the bumper case.  The opening for the thirty pin connector is larger on the Otterbox case.- Putting the screen protector on can be frustrating but I was mostly successful this time.  Dust must be avoided at all cost while applying it.  Hey Intel, can I use your clean room for a few minutes?It's a good compromise between protection and bulk.  If you had the 3G version you might be a little disappointed because the fit on this one doesn't seem quite as good.Update (9/2/2010):  The reviewer(s) that said the case can be uncomfortable on your ear while making calls was right.  If you make a lot of calls this could be rather annoying.  I'll post a picture or two of the offending sharp edge.  I filed the edge on mine with my Leatherman to smooth it out. That helped a lot.Regards,John",4.0,1283212800,"08 31, 2010",OtterBox Commuter Series Hybrid Case for AT&amp;T and Verizon iPhone 4 (Purple/White) (Doesn't support iPhone 4S),34.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413WDwYHPwL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 62936},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

I don't need a belt clip so I'm ok with this style.  I like that the phone is protected, but it doesn't look or feel like a brick. I can still operate all of the buttons and such in the case. The front isn't protected so I'm careful not to put it in my pocket with my keys. Also I find it a little hard to keep the camera lens in back clean, not that I want the camera lens covered...

B004AJ8PG8,A1414YWW0VUQCJ,"Matthew Morse ""Matthew""","[1, 1]","I'll start this review with saying that I really want to love this case, but there are a few issues about this case that I absolutely do not like. I'll start with the good...The case is very well made. It fits the phone pretty well and doesn't add a lot of bulk and weight. I love the textured plastic they use and the fact that their silicone inner layer doesn't grab the insides of my pockets and pick up lint, hair, etc. (the Incipio Silicrylic case is often compared to the OtterBox Commuter, but its silicone layer is very loose-fitting and picks up lint and particles from your pockets, etc.). I like that the buttons are covered and that the case has a lip that extends above the screen to protect against setting the phone down on surfaces (although I have a Zagg InvisiSHIELD on my iPhone so it wouldn't matter).The things I didn't like were that the case is a bit of a bear to get on the phone. The silicone goes on with ease, obviously because it's a stretchy rubber skin. However, the plastic takes some finagling. You have to sort of massage the silicone and plastic shel to get them to sit together seamlessly. Even then, it's not quite as snug as I'd like. Also, the port covers are annoying. This case is not waterproof, nor is it really water resistant so the port covers are a bit useless. The headphone port cover is a bit of a pain to get to go back in the slot (although not as tough as the one for my iPad, seen in another review). Also, the port on the bottom of the phone doesn't allow for larger accessories. I use a Griffin 10' charging cable and an iGo car adapter and neither one fit with this case. My final gripe is that they made a cutout for the Apple logo on the back, but there's no protection there. No clear plastic, no back glass protection film, nothing. They include a front screen protector, but nothing for the exposed logo on the back. The Commuter for iPad, while not my main case (see my review of that for why) has a plastic covering for the logo so it shows through, but remains protected. After just a few days of using this case, I pulled the phone out to switch to a different case and the back was filthy, especially around that hole. Not a good design choice by OtterBox at all. They so tightly covered all of the other ports and buttons, but just left the back wide open. Shame...While this is a good case and offers a lot of protection, it just wasn't for me.PROS:* Good fit (not great, but good)* Good level of protection* Good materials make this case look and feel great* Works great with my Zagg InvisiSHIELD screen protector (and others I'm sure)CONS:* Doesn't fit as snuggly as I'd like and getting the case on takes some finesse* Bottom port doesn't allow for third party chargers and accessories and docks are completely out of the question* Port covers are annoying and since this isn't a water proof/resistant case, they're a little unnecessary and just get in the way* Opening on back panel exposes Apple logo and lets in dirt and debris which is silly considering they went to all the trouble to close everything else up (a back glass protection film would be nice to have)* A little bit too bulky for my taste, but that's subjective so I'll leave that up to you :)",4.0,1302048000,"04 6, 2011",OtterBox Commuter Series Hybrid Case for AT&amp;T and Verizon iPhone 4 (Purple/White) (Doesn't support iPhone 4S),34.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413WDwYHPwL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 62936},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

BUY IT HERE AT AMAZON!This is the first phone case I've ever bought that didn't have some kind of issue with the quality. OtterBox must have great quality control. The harder white plastic fits into the soft black bumper material perfectly. No wierd gapping. I can access all the buttons with no issues.The only complaint I have is that the white plastic doesn't totally match the white on my iPhone. The iPhone is a teeny bit ivory compared to the almost bluish white of the Otter cover. However, with use, I'm sure the white of the cover will get a little dingy and match better.

B004AJ8PG8,ADGIGEKDJNY4A,P. Carboni,"[1, 1]","I've had this case for about 5 months now and I would not hesitate to get it again. It provides solid protection against bumps, scratches, and simple drops without all the added bulk that the Otterbox Defender brings. My wife, who is more accident prone than I am, has the defender model, so that's my point of comparison. A few pros & cons:PROS:1. It does slide pretty easily in and out of my pocket.2. Covers for the ports are very functional - much more so than the Defender.3. I believe volume buttons are actually easier to push with this case than without a case at all.4. It just works...it does what it is suppose to do without any real inconveniences.5. Comes with a front screen protector (but I didn't use it).6. Easy to take off to clean the phone.CONS:1. As has been pointed out in multiple reviews, I had to get a fingernail file and sand down the plastic cover so it wouldn't bother my ear. It only took a few minutes though, so this isn't really a huge problem for me.2. No rear glass protector is included, which I think is a problem since they leave the Apple logo exposed.3. Dust tends to collect in the speakers and in the noise canceling mic.4. Very difficult to fit in my alarm clock docking station, but it will fit which is more than I can say for my wife's Defender protected phone.5. Somewhat difficult to flip the vibrate/ring switch since it is now recessed in the opening.6. The exposed silicon corners sometimes keep it from sliding with ease in and out of my pocket, but usually this is not an issue.I did not use the included screen protector and instead ordered a front and rear skin from BodyGuardz, so i cannot comment on the quality of the included screen protector.",4.0,1302048000,"04 6, 2011",OtterBox Commuter Series Hybrid Case for AT&amp;T and Verizon iPhone 4 (Purple/White) (Doesn't support iPhone 4S),34.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413WDwYHPwL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 62936},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

The packaging was in superb condition when my Otterbox Commuter arrived.  The problem is with the seller, Ross Electronics.  This product did not come in retail packaging as advertised; it came bulk packaged, in a zip lock Baggie with an Avery label on it, and no instructions or warranty information.  Once I opened the Baggie, I came to suspect that this case had either sustained some real damage in a warehouse before being bagged, or it was just plain used.  The silicone sleeve was dusty, and severely damaged on the top left corner:  there was a ""chewed"" spot by the volume controls and a nasty tear by the headphone jack.  When I tried it on my phone, I saw that the hard plastic part was warped, so that it would not fit correctly on my phone.

The phone should easily withstand a drop from 6ft. or so, probably higher, without incurring any damage.  The case fits almost perfectly.  I say ""almost"" because as others have mentioned the cutout for the mute switch on the side is slightly off.

The Defender case can be rather bulky and hard to pull out of your pockets without taking everything else out at the same time, even the pocket itself!  The Commuter case feels solid and the rubber on the sides give you a secure grip when using your iPhone.  I've dropped it a few times on carpet and on hardwood floor accidentally while walking and my iPhone is fine.  This case is appropriate for folks like me who have to wear dress clothes everyday.  Its easily accessible to and from your pockets in virtually all dress clothes material and never pulls your pockets out.  However, i still use my Defender case when i go out on the weekends with family or jogging, outdoor activities, etc. because I use my iphone to take a lot of pictures.Defender case:Pros:a. Better Protection and more impact resistant than the Commuter and any other case in the market.b. The external rubber case is great for placing your iphone on your car dash or console and it will stay put!c. Rubber case makes it easy to take pictures as the iphone sticks to your hands!Cons:a. It's a little bulky for formal attire and even jeans. the rubber tends to stick on your pockets pulling everything out.b. There are no other cons!Commuter case:Pros:a. Not as bulky and case still feels pretty solid and protects iphone from drops.b. Doesn't cling to pocket sleeve.Cons:a. Not as sturdy as the Defender case.b. Not as easy to grip as the Defender for taking picturesc. Plastic part of the case just above the charging port is very thin and can break easily.  I have seen many complaints in the reviews about this part breaking!Both Cases have horrible screen protectors.  They reduce the retina display quality severely.  Resolution: Remove the Screen protector that comes with the Defender series case and don't install the screen protector that comes with the Commuter case.  If you use your iPhone a lot like me, it is hard to stick with only one case.  I recommend getting both of these cases and you will be set for all situations.

Screen shattered to the point it needed to be replaced. After the replacement cost we decided to go with an OtterBox. I was expecting protection, but was very pleasantly surprised at the overall thougtfulness and design quality.Firt it wasn't nearly as bulky as I thought it would be. Of course it makes it much thicker but the other dimensions are roughly left the same. Second it was made by people who use iPhones. The bottom can be opened up and it fits with every single iPhone speaker dock we have (we have 3). The cameras work great, no insignificant feat. The headphones are covered but open up when needed. A big plus for my wife is that the bottom power on button is fully covered. This area is easy to get dirt and debris in so that is a nice touch.And you get a permanent screen cover without having to worry about bubbles or replacements. And the touch has not been negatively effected at all. Last couple of points. GREAT gripiness. Really good. And not only grippy but also soft and comfortable. Underneath is the protective piece. Would it have saved our screen? Not entirely sure but most likely yes. We have a very non-protective case on it. All in all with the multidue of thoughtful features, very easy to highly recommend.

When I decided to get the iPhone 4 for Verizon, this was an easy choice for me.  It's ideal for unexpected drops, bumps, and (minor) spills.  With all of their products, you sacrifice sleek and sexy for durable and sensible.  It adds bulk to the device, and covers the attractive edging, but if you're seriously considering an Otterbox, you're likely more concerned about not having to replace the thing when you inevitably drop it in a parking lot somewhere.  Contrary to some earlier reviews, I believe it fits the Verizon iPhone 4 just fine.  I can access the mute button without a problem.  I agree that the alignment is slightly off, but it's hardly a chore to reach it (for me at least).  Touch screen is not effected negatively at all by the built in screen cover (nor the two slots for the camera lenses).  Smudging is inevitable, but easily remedied with a wipe from a clean cloth.  The silicon cover does grip against some pocket materials, so you may find your pocket inside out every now and again when you pull it out.  I am fully confident that my iPhone 4 is safe and sound from the many drops that I will give it over the course of the next 2+ years.  That being said, I did spring for a 2 year protection plan because if you submerge it, or have a major spill, even this case will not be enough to save it.",5.0,1302825600,"04 15, 2011",OtterBox Universal Defender Case for iPhone 4 (Black Silicone &amp; Black Plastic),35.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41fiyOqEVbL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8963},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

The Defender was my very first purchase for both my iPhone 4 and my wife's, and so far I haven't been disappointed.  I still like the product 8 months later and would recommend it.Pros:- Very good protection - I've banged mine around a bit by accident and its never shown any issues -- note that I've never purposely tried to drop or abuse it and wouldn't recommend trying that unless you have a spare- Great feel - the rubberized outer protection layer makes this very comfortable to hold and provides a nice grip - I never liked the feel of an iPhone out of the case as it is too small and too slick feeling -- I always felt like I was going to drop it- the clip-on holster is sturdy and is a nice addition for people that don't want to carry their phone in a pocket or purse and is very sturdy (its been the only clip-on case that has ever lasted for more than 3 months for me - well done!)- clip-on holster can also be used as a stand for both portrait and landscape viewing - this is a great feature!- comes with a built-in screen protector - nice that I didn't have to buy/install a screen protector and its very easy to clean and keep clean- easy to install - wasn't near as bad as my initial impression and have done it several times since to clean the inside- all buttons/openings/etc on the iPhone are accessible and the covers fit (and stay) very nicely, this is much better than on the other Defender series cases for iPod Touch and iPad- price on Amazon currently is amazing - I'd highly recommend this based on the value you get -- in fact, I'd suggest you get a couple if you are planning to keep your iPhone 4 for 9 months or longerCons:- the rubberized outer layer is starting to show signs of stretching after 8 months of use, especially around the see-through window on the back - also noticing this around the covering for the 32-pin connector- the case doesn't fit together completely - when you squeeze the front and back of the case, you notice some movement and you'll also see that dust begins to creep into the inside of the case and shows up under the screen protector, which is one reason that I open and clean it every few months - though I also wonder how many times this was designed to be opened (am I compounding the issue by doing this?)- clip-on holster is bulky, but doesn't have to be used- adds some weight to the iPhone, but the trade off is a good feel and sense of protection - well worth itRecommendations:- would be nice to see if there is a way to overcome the ""stretch"" factor for the rubberized outer covering - in fact, I just ordered another one from Amazon to replace the previous one- see if you can tighten up the specs a bit to prevent the dust ""creep"" that is happening with both of the iPhones that I have in this case currently - not a major issue, but a bit annoying to have to tear it apart and clean it every few monthsOverall, for the price currently being charged and the value derived, I would highly recommend this to anyone.  Now if price is not a concern, you might consider another alternative such as the Lifeproof case (which I haven't tried yet, but looks like it has most all of the same features and adds water/dust proof, but also lacks some of the accessories as of this writing).

B004M5KV3A,AVFJ327UXPXLF,"Jerry Helsing ""jlhelsing""","[0, 0]","I really like this case.  I mean, I really like it a lot.  However, nothing is perfect and this is no exception, although I have to admit, what my complaints are can not be easily fixed to make it perfect.So, lets get the bad stuff out of the way:1)  It is very bulky.  It must double the thickness of the phone.  Obviously, it needs this to protect properly, but it is cumbersome.2)  The silicone cover needs to be removed before the plastic case can be removed.  And then to put the silicone cover back on requires some time.3)  This does not allow for charging from a docking station  If charging is needed, you need a cable charger unless you want to take the case apart and then when done, put the whole thing back together.4)  I have not experienced this, but my wife has a problem with ""cheek dialing"" with this case if she holds it on her shoulder.  She only has this problem with this case.Okay, that's enough about the complaints.  The good is that it works well.  I have dropped, kicked, sat on and nearly drowned my phone with no ill effects.

B004M5KV3A,A1X1CEGHTHMBL1,jjceo,"[1, 1]","I have purchased 3 of these and recommended them to 5 other family members.  These cases are great and they protect your iPhone like no other case.  They come with a hard plastic case with a felt inner liner to protect your iPhone and it has a built in screen protector that resists finger prints and bubbles (You will have to clean it).  It then has a textured silicon rubber skin exterior that helps you grip the device and protect it from falls, yes they do happen!  The phone and case then snaps into the belt holster either face-in (max protection) or face-out for viewing.  The holster clips on your belt and will also rotate.  In addition you can lock the belt clip open and use it as a stand to set your phone on a table or airline tray to watch videos.  I liked the Zircon blue color and my wife got a pink one.I accidently dropped my iPhone onto a 2 inch square steel rod about 3  feet down and my heart stopped.  Not a scratch and it still worked perfectly.  Since the iPhone 4 is made of hardened glass on the front and back I am sure that it would have cracked, broken or chipped without the case.  Thank you Otterbox!Just a warning is that the case does make your phone bigger and it probably will not plug into your stand charger or player/speaker system.  Cable chargers work fine.  You don't get to see the beauty of your fantastic designed iPhone but you will keep it from being damaged from your human mistakes.By the way, Otterbox has the best customer service available.

B004M5KV3A,A10IKHRUSMKP46,"J. Kaye Oldner ""Judith""","[2, 2]","The OtterBox brand has been around for long enough to be well-established. If you're just now getting with the program, like me, OtterBox is a tough case for your iPhone. Getting one is simply an experience in itself. I've had experience with other cases and this doesn't come close to comparison.With the OtterBox, there's actually two cases. One is hard and comes with clear window for the touchscreen, which means there's no need for a screen protector. The second case is an outer soft cushion that's textured for better grip. It also protects the ports with flaps that sort of snap into place. Sounds weird since this is a soft texture, but that's what it feels like.Inside the box--actually printed on the inside, are assembling instructions that are easy to follow, but it's a no-brainer putting this together. Common sense will pretty much guide you through.After putting on the soft case, I noticed the hole of the earphone didn't line up. I thought this was a flaw until I visited their website. Here's what was posted:  ""Actually, the port cover is correct. The hole in the port cover is intended to leave open access for the noise-cancelling mic. To use headphones you need to open this port cover. This cover prevents dust and dirt from entering the device when the headphone jack is not in use.""If you've never used an OtterBox, YouTube has so many bizarre demonstrations of iPhone users dropping their devices off houses, apartment complexes and buildings. One person even drop-kicked their iPhone a couple of times and the OtterBox held up and also defended the phone. I have no intention of doing anything that extreme. I just wanted a heavy-duty cover with a good clip--which is included--so that I can listen to music during exercising. Since I live in a humid climate where it rains a lot, I also needed something to protect the iPhone.

Park,"[0, 0]","First of all i would like to say that i got this case because as of now there arent any otterbox cases meant for verizons iphone and i dont wanna wait for that to happen as it might take a while and it only takes a second for you to drop your 600$ investment. This case fit my verizon iphone perfectly and feels quite sturdy. HOWEVER!! This case does have a flaw..The problems with the case is that the silence(vibrate) switch on the upper left hand corner isnt aligned properly with the hole in the case meant for it making it difficult to put the phone on vibrate. If you had fat fingers it WILL prove extremely difficult if not impossible for you to put the phone on vibrate using just your bare hands. You probably wouldnt wanna use some random object to turn the switch on considering you might scratch your phone. And if you are as anal as me about damaging your personal property, it makes for a very big deal..Luckilly my fingers can just barely make it unless i happen to need to put it on vibrate that very same day i cut my fingernails.Everything else however works perfectly and is right where it needs to be such as the holes for earpiece, cameras, speakers and places where every other buttons need to be. .This problem can be seen in the customer provided pictures for the case on actual verizon iphones. If you are buying this case just for protection of your phone you will be very satisfied but if you intend on putting the phone on vibrate or silence frequently and have big fingers than this just isnt the case for you...Not a huge deal but definately worth considering..Totally worth the price compared to a legit 40 dollar VERIZON Iphone case directly from otterbox.",4.0,1301356800,"03 29, 2011",OtterBox Universal Defender Case for iPhone 4 (Black Silicone &amp; Black Plastic),35.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41fiyOqEVbL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8963},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B004M5KV3A,ARQPQ8LF5NTEZ,keysgirl,"[0, 0]","The website and I think even the amazon description says it does not fit the white iphone. SOme think this is b/c of rumors the white phone is thicker but it is actually potential interference with the proximity sensor. Regardless, I have an ATT white iphone 4 and have been using this case for a few weeks with no issues related to fit or the proximity sensor. Symptoms of problems with this relate to making phone calls and the screen wither not shutting off when placed to your ear or not re-awakening when you pull it away from your face- I have had this with my last phone and a different case so know what to look for and there is definitely no issue with that.Aside from that I have to agree with many of the other reviews about the quality of this case compared to the 3Gs Defender case.  I have had 3 iphones and 3 defender cases and although there are some improvements with this one (specifically the dock connector space will accomodate more sizes/shpaes of OEM connectors. The silicone covering is not as picket friendly as the last defender case and feels thinner and more prose to losing its shape or all out ripping. When you put it on it feels a little like you are molding clay to fit the plastic case- you have to smoosh it into every seam. the dock cover wanted to pop off too easily on the first one I got (not on amazon) but I returned it and the second one seems to fit a little better. I also feel there are more openings in this case leaving it vulnerable to wet environments. Otterbox does not claim it is water proof or even water resistant I don't think but they actually called the first one splash proof or something and then stepped back from that with the 2nd one and now this one feels even less so. I take an use it out on a boat and there were times I had a puddle of water sitting on the screen of the 3GS case - I never worried about it. I do not feel anywhere near as comfortable with this one. I think the silicone issue was an effort to make it less bulky and it is but I wish they offered the thicker one for the customers who really want that much protection.I also hate the hole at the top for  the facetime mic. Given that this feature is not used all that often would it be a big deal to have to remove a cover when you were using facetime? I understand that the camera can no longer be covered b/c of the flash but I would prefer a less holey case. I have to conclude that this is likely still the best case on the market and I am relieved it does fit the white iphone but it is dissapointing. They screwed up their commuter case too but I will leave that for another review!p.s. there are lots of white cases out there that cause a haze over photos when the flash is used and I am happy to say that is NOT an issue with this case so hats off for that at least!",3.0,1309651200,"07 3, 2011",OtterBox Universal Defender Case for iPhone 4 (Black Silicone &amp; Black Plastic),35.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41fiyOqEVbL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8963},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

Luckily for me the iPhone was still working just fine, but I got a little spooked by the experience.I decided I wanted a case with maximum protection and I've known for a while about the Defender series from Otterbox, so I gave it a shot.I've had the case on my iPhone 4 for a week now. Here are my observations:* The case offers excellent protection for you iPhone. Unlike most cases that only cover the back of your iPhone, the Defender covers the front and has a built-in screen protector. Suffice to say protection wise you are all but set with this case.* The built-in screen protector is a really nice touch. It does not ""oil-slick"" or create any ugly bumps. It also causes you not to lose any touch responsiveness. (So important!)* The case comes with a belt clip which is made of nice plastic. I'm not a cell-phone-belt-clip kinda guy, but if you are, you'll be happy here.* Putting on the case was pretty simple (there is a video on YouTube by Otterbox in case you need help). However taking off the case is another story entirely. You need to lift up and then pull apart a notch on the top of the hard shell to remove the case. I had to learn this via a user submitted YouTube video. Otterbox should have a ""how to remove your case"" video too.* The case adds weight and bulk to your iPhone. However it's much less than I expected.* The case is a dust magnet. The dust that gets on the silicone isn't a big deal in my opinion, however it will be unsightly on your screen protector (especially corners and edges) and on the two covered holes on the front of the case and the two open holes on the back (camera and flash). This isn't a huge deal however it does bother me to look at my case after only a week and see dust gathering in places where it didn't before I used the Defender.* The screen protector is great (as I said before) however be aware that all screen protectors take a way from the clarity of your glass screen. Essentially your screen goes from bright and clear sans protector to a bit grainy with it on. It doesn't really bother me however it is noticeable.* The volume and home button is super responsive with the case because Otterbox smartly included little bumps on the silicone case so when you press those buttons with the case on it works well.* The cut out hole on the back of the case is excellent for when you want to pull your iPhone out of your pocket (just put your thumb in that hole) or when you are holding the phone to your ear and you can nicely place your index finger on that spot.So is this my new everyday case? I've decided no. Instead I will just use it when the weather is bad, I'm off to the beach, or I'm going to be in a social setting where I am worried others might use my iPhone to snap photos, etc. I'm going to revert back to my old silicone case because I miss the clarity of using the screen without a screen protector plus it won't collect dust in those little spots as the Defender did. But I'm still glad I have the option to use the Defender when needed.The iPhone 4 is a slippery piece of hardware (hello all-glass back/front) and I highly recommend a case in general. That flat backing doesn't help when gripping the phone and placing it near your ear. The Defender is an excellent choice in that it truly protects your iPhone unlike other cases that offer much less peace of mind. However in the end you'll have to determine how much protection you think you'll need and if you are willing to live with additional bulk and weight added to your iPhone.",4.0,1316131200,"09 16, 2011",OtterBox Universal Defender Case for iPhone 4 (Black Silicone &amp; Black Plastic),35.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41fiyOqEVbL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8963},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

All of the flaps stay in place just fine, but you do have to press along the edge to get it in just right.  Camera works fine, sensors work fine, volume buttons work fine.

B004M5KV3A,A2FIC05DY3HT7J,"Philster ""Philster""","[2, 2]","I gave in to pressure and bought iPhones, and must admit I'm starting to like the thing...However, since the first iPhone came out over four years ago, I've seen the effects of dropping the phone.  I've seen the screens cracked and the back of the phones shattering, and did not want to deal with those issues, even with insurance.This case didn't seem like it would be very protective when it is in three parts, but when assembled around the phone, it creates a barrier that protects the phone better than any other case I've seen on the market.  I see people walking around with phones with no cases and others with only a rubber case wrapped around the phone, which would not protect the phone in a serious fall...  I've dropped my phone several times on parking lots, and from a three foot fall onto concrete or asphalt, I've had no damage after taking the case off the phone.  Incredibly, even the case doesn't show the wear from being dropped.This case goes on the phone in three parts, the first two being a plastic case that when assembled around the phone is extremely rigid, and has some padding inside the case.  The third part is the rubber shield, which fits around the plastic case, and acts as a bumper if the phone is dropped, as well as a non-slip surface when holding the phone or setting it down.These cases sell for $50 at most retail stores, but Amazon comes in at $20 - $30 for the case, which is not cheap, but will pay for itself in protecting the phone.

I just wanted to leave my experience for use with the 4s.  It protects and fits great.  I only have 2 small issues. One is that you have to lift the flap to access the earphone port.  My second issue is that I've also found that the touch screen is not as sensitive to touch.  Before I put my Otterbox on, I had a Zagg Invisishield on my screen.  With that on the screen, the Otterbox touch screen worked great and registered every little keystroke.  But it would press onto the inside of the Otter screen and cause a splotchy mark that limited my visual.  I had to remove my Zagg screen shield to get rid of the weird sheen and then I noticed the touch pad wasn't working so great.  I hope this helps anyone deciding on the Defender case.

B004M5KV3A,A3DPTTNXDA4CPL,Randy Parsons,"[0, 0]","Good:  Strong large case.  Seems to protect everything. Easier to hold the phone now with the rubbery grip and larger size.  Read the tips below and you will not have any problems.Bad:  Large size(bad for some, maybe necessary to protect the Iphone.  This case is primarily designed to protect and allow for drops).Needs modifying:Needed to use a little baby powder between the screen cover and iphone. (a tip I picked up on the web); this removes the air bubbles that get trapped between the phone and clear plastic cover.Removed the small clear plastic cover on the inside top of the case which covers the forward camera and sensors. This was easy to do.  The face sensor turns the screen off when you hold the phone to your ear. It is blocked by this plastic, allowing your face to hit keys, like the mute button, while you are on the phone.  The cover interferes with this, so it had to go. The depth of the case still protects the sensor just fine.  Your brightness sensor might also be affected by this case.The case is somewhat difficult to put together and take apart. Make sure to stretch the rubber and pull towards you to get it to grab the edges of the front of the screen.  The rubber can grip your pocket while taking it out. On the other hand, its harder for it to fall out of your pocket too.(The bare Iphone seems to be designed to slip away from anything, hands and pockets).Note: the tiny hole at the top is for the noise cancelling mic, not for the audio plug.  You need to open the flap to plug in the audio connecter.  This is as designed to keep dirt out of the hole. (I read this on the company's site)I really like this case. Once its together and modified and clean, you should not have to take it apart for a long time.  Follow the above advice, clean the screen well before installing the case and you will like it a lot.  Feels like I can drop this on concrete and not have any problems.This is not a slim case, nor is it elegant.

If you value your device this is the way to go.  This is my second purchase of such a case and that should speak volumes. My previous case lasted almost two years before I finally decided to replace it. Ultimately, the phone has outlasted the case.  I am one who constantly drops my phone due to the fact that I am constantly on the go and in and out of my vehicle all day long.The three piece design, which includes a screen protector provides constant protection of the face of the phone as well as the vulnerable corners of your device.  While the only draw-back might only be the rugged silicone which wraps around the two-piece plastic case design, it certainly provides protection and grip to the phone.  The draw-back being that it does not allow your phone to slide in and out of your pockets as easily as one would hope.The flaps that cover the phone's usable components such as the charging pins, on and off button, and earphone jack have a tendency to flip open at times, but they still offer a certain level of protection regardless.  While the phone offers a little more bulk to the device, I would much rather have the bulk than to have a damaged phone.When I wear this case out, I am certain that I will purchase another.",4.0,1322438400,"11 28, 2011",OtterBox Universal Defender Case for iPhone 4 (Black Silicone &amp; Black Plastic),35.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41fiyOqEVbL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8963},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

The plastic screen protector dulls the otherwise vibrant colors of the iPhone 4; luckily it is only held on with a bit of glue and it was easy to remove (just push it out when the case is dismantled).The other problem is that the outer silicon layer keeps coming loose. It sits properly until you try to pull it out of your pocket, at which point the silicon layer doesn't sit right anymore, and you have to re-set it. It's not a huge deal but it is a constant small annoyance.Also, one reason I bought this case was because it comes with a belt clip. However, the belt clip part is SO bulky, I never wear it. It makes walking around, sitting down and standing up, uncomfortable. Also, a belt clip should make my iPhone instantly accessible - that's why I want one - but this clip makes it very difficult to remove the iPhone with just one hand. It ends up being an awkward two-handed affair that, frankly, renders moot the benefits of a belt clip.Finally, this thing is VERY grippy, which is good for holding onto the phone but rather awful for getting it out your pocket. I have literally turned pockets inside out when attempting to remove the phone -- and when I finally do get it out, there is often a credit card stuck to the back because it is so grippy!Overall, it's fine at the reduced price that Amazon charges, and it definitely provides protection, but I think there are probably other cases out there that provide almost as much protection while not having the same problems as this one.",3.0,1321920000,"11 22, 2011",OtterBox Universal Defender Case for iPhone 4 (Black Silicone &amp; Black Plastic),35.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41fiyOqEVbL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8963},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B004UTVRQS,A2PRIQ2EA5GYML,William M. Gibson,"[0, 0]","I have 3 of these cases for myself and my 2 daughters.  I did alot of research, and this is the perfect compromise between protection, form factor and functionality.It is NOT a big, bulky, tank like case that offers absolute maximum protection, so if that is what you are looking for, this is not your case.  If you are looking for something that basically fits your Ipod like a glove, maintaining it's sleek form factor, while offering excellent (but not maximum) protection, this is your case.  All 3 of us have dropped our Ipods at one time or another, and these cases have performed well.  The Ipods, and the cases, were not damaged.If you have dockable music players, this case is almost mandatory.  The bottom 1/2 of the case slides off easily, allowing your Ipod to be docked.  Other cases, even good cases by Otterbox (i.e. the Defender series) do not have this functionality.  You have to remove the Ipod from the case to dock.  Easier said than done, especially if you dock your Ipod frequently.One caveat.  Don't bother with the screen protector.  It may work well if you put it on and never take the bottom half of the case off to dock your Ipod, but if you do, then the constant sliding of the lower part of the case against the screen protector will take its toll.  I say this from experience.  I really don't think the screen protector offers much in the way of added protection anyway, so I am not the least bit concerned about not having it on.Overall, I highly recommend this case.  I like it so much, that one of the reasons I am holding off on upgrading my Ipod to 5th generation, is because Otterbox has not made a Reflex case yet, and I don't see a suitable alternative from anyone else.  I'm not going to spend $300+ on a new Ipod and not have a decent case to put it in.",5.0,1357257600,"01 4, 2013",Otterbox Reflex Series Case for iPod touch 4G - Hot Pink/Black,49.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510yZVH%2BW5L._SY300_.jpg,,OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

It's a miracle that my Incredible 2 did not break after dropping it several times during the first few weeks with the flimsy rubber case I got from Verizon. After my last scare, I got on to Amazon to order this case. I had previously owned an original Motorola Droid and had an Otterbox Commuter case. I really didn't like that case too much, particularly the smooth hard plastic back (in fact the entire exterior of that case was smooth, hard plastic). On this case, the *interior* is hard plastic and the exterior is a soft rubber that has a sort of diamond-patterned tread on it. It feels *great* in the hand and completely gives me the feeling that if I drop it, it will survive. I also like how it has a plastic cover for the screen. I left my regular screen protector below it, but this plastic cover just gives one more layer of protection. To sum up, I'd recommend this case to anyone clumsy like me. At $30 on Amazon it's a great deal compared to the list price of $50.

That said, the holster was great, the protection was awesome and if I worked in Construction or some other rough-and-tumble trade, that would have been the perfect option.So I sent that back and ordered the Commuter Series.  I like it!  Only I am giving it 4 stars because I would have loved it if there were a holster or belt-clip with it.  For some reason, I hate putting my phone in my pocket or purse and prefer to have it somewhere that it is always accessible and this happens to be my belt or hooked on my pocket.  And, this way the phone does not collect dust and ""pocket fuzz"" (and the Commuter Series does tend to collect it quite well on the silicone cover). But, alas, the holster I purchased (also through Amazon) will not fit the phone with this case on it.That said, the case has a lot of plusses!!!  The bulk (from the Defender Series) is considerably less.  The sides around the display are not high and this makes everything accessible.  The protection is amazing.  I am not a phone dropper but I love to have a nice phone.  The OtterBox Commuter Series, in my opinion is classy and sleek and makes for a professional phone. I do kind of wish it came in other colors (such as royal blue) but I have not found that yet.The self-adhesive screen cover is great.  It comes with a OtterBox installation card (so you don't have to use your credit card - lol!) and when I put it on, following the installation instructions, it was simple and there are no bubbles.  It also comes with a little screen cleaning cloth which is cute.Yes, it does collect finger-prints but I think, in time, as my other self-adhesive screen covers did, this dies down after using it for a while, and believe-you-me, I'd rather have that than a scratched, messed-up screen. (My last screen protector saved me from a serious scratch when I was working on the construction of my house roof, the scratch only made it through the screen-protector and could have been BAD; all the way through the screen).  Also, I use my Friendly Swede styluses (also highly recommended) a lot so this cuts down on the finger prints.The price was great!  The price listed on the box was $34.00 and I believe I got this, with shipping, for around $10.00.

B0051PH9LC,A2H9G9T3YR30YF,Nom de Plum,"[15, 15]","Okay, to start, I work around and in the water, in the rain, snow, weather, etc.  I've had an Otterbox on my Blackberry 8350i, my now retired Centro, and now on my Samsung Charge.  I schlep around the Blackberry and the Charge together on the same belt in Otterbox cases.  So this is where I'm coming from.This case is large, as someone else has written.  And no duh on that.  The damned phone is huge, so the case will make it that much bigger.  Deal with it!The Otterbox case fits very well onto the Charge, and the quality of the plastic and neoprene castings is excellent.  The clear plastic screen protector is integral to the plastic front cover of the case and it has no negative impact upon the functionality of the Charge's touch screen.  The belt-clip holster for the case is of the snap-in variety, not a true holster like on the 8350i or Centro.  For the uninitiated, what this means is that there's a little tab that holds the Charge in the holster and this tab must be lightly depressed in order to extract the phone from the holster.  This tab is pretty prominent in the glamor shots of the case.  While I'm quite suspicious of this design, so far there's been no problem with the Charge popping out (although I've had the case only about 24-hours).  The belt clip on the holster allows for the holster to be rotated in 15-degree increments as is usual for the Otterbox Defender cases I'm familiar with.  There are covers for all the ports (HDMI, micro-USB, and headphone jack) and these are all well placed and seal well.  There is enough room to plug my rather sizable after-market micro-USB charge/data cable into the USB port which surprised me after reading someone else's review complaining of the need to take the Charge out of the case to charge the battery.  The volume and power buttons are all very well placed and responsive.  As compared with the cheap plastic case I had before, these buttons are all 500% more responsive and much easier to locate tactily because of the bump-outs in the neoprene.So, with all the above why did I only give this case 4-stars?  First off, I'm a hard grader.  Secondly, I'm not impressed at how well the case seals the Charge.  There is *NO* cover to the rear facing camera, the ear piece, or the rear speaker!  I didn't look really closely but there may also be no cover to the front-facing camera or the proximity sensor.  Having experienced the 8350i and Centro Otterbox cases with some type of white cover (water absorbing?) on the speakers and ear pieces of these phones I'm quite disappointed.  I envision being out in the rain and having one single rain drop hit the ear piece and fry the phone.  I consider this a big design flaw.  Thirdly (you are still counting, right) the neoprene over the four hard-buttons along the bottom of the phone is black (""no kidding"", right?)  But this neoprene has very little for the non Braille-readers to distinguish these four buttons from one another.  So where I used to be able to grab the Charge in the dark, find the power button on the side, and then proceed visually, now I still need to fumble around to hit the four hard buttons (Menu, Home, Back, and Search).  If the neoprene were *clear* or *translucent* then this wouldn't be a problem.  Also, I find that unlike the volume and power buttons on the sides, the four buttons along the bottom take a lot of force to activate.  I attribute this to the neoprene.  And fourthly the belt clip on the holster seems *less* beefy than on the Defender case for my other two phones.  In my experience the belt clip is the weak link on these Defender cases and I wouldn't have expected that the Charge's case would be *less* strong.  But, time will tell...Well, that's about it.  I'll try to update this review in about a month.  I hope it helps people decide what they will be doing.### UPDATE 10jul2012 ###The above review was from Aug2011, now it's about a year later.I still have the phone, I still have the case.  I think I'd probably give it 3.5 stars now.  About 8-months into having the case the clip for the holster broke on my belt (remember I said the belt clip was the weak link on these cases?)  Well, Otterbox honored the warranty and sent me a whole new case (cover and holster) when I submitted a claim.  This warranty resolution was easy and and part of the reason the case doesn't get fewer stars.Shortly before this, however, the phone fell out of the holster while I was near the water.  Long story short, the phone was submerged in about 6-inches of water for 5-minutes.  I'm pretty sure the Otterbox case on the phone helped a lot to keep out the water (the red tattle tale on the battery is barely turned) and the phone is still, knock wood, working.  But, to avoid this problem in the future, I now have the phone in a Nite Ize caseNite Ize Clip Case Cargo Magnet Tall - 1 Pack - Bulk Packaging - Black.  The Nite Ize case only makes the phone on my belt a hair bigger than the holster from Otterbox, and I've never had a problem with a Nite Ize clip or case.So, there you go; hybrid solution.

Also, not that it matters much, because I have the controls memorized, if you want the lights on your menu, home, back and search buttons to show, this covers that completely and you cannot see them in the dark.

I have problems trying to type P and Q and backspace with my huge fingers, but definitely will protect the screen if dropped.-Case takes some fiddling to get on/off, But after a few times of taking it off and putting it back on, It goes on easy and fast.-I have noticed a slight discoloration from the plastic on the screen. It is nothing major but after looking at the screen in and out of the case i can see a slight difference. it seems to take some of the brightness away.-Easily doubles the thickness of the phone, Which may be a bad thing to some people.Definitely a must have case if your out working all the time, where your phone can be dropped or bumped into constantly.

It also allowed some pretty nasty damage to the face of my phone, and while removing it just now I discovered that the stupid case cracked! While switching it, I saw a LOOONG crack down the back of the holster part. No matter how slowly/carefully I moved, the crack expanded and eventually the case split in half. I've had it less than a week! Good that I was removing it in order to switch to Otterbox anyway; bad that the store probably won't take it back now.Needless to say, I will never leave Otterbox again! While I'm galloping around the city, I need to ensure that my phone is safe. I'll just carry a power pack with me and forego the extended battery.

It's certainly worth spending approximately $30.00 now to avoid having to replace a potentially damaged phone in the future ($699.00 retail!) to say nothing of the fact that regularly using this case will certainly increase the trade-in/resale value of the phone kept therein when it's time to get a new phone.I also really like the built-in screen protector. There's no need to bother with often difficult to apply stand-alone screen protectors.I have noticed several complaints about the size of the case in reviews posted here, namely that it makes this already large phone even larger.Personally, I don't find the increased bulk of the phone (especially the thickness) while in the Otterbox to be very bothersome. The Droid Bionic is already a big phone from the get go and will remain so no matter what you do.If your employment/work situation allows you to wear cargo pants on a regular basis, I find that this is the best way to always readily have this phone at your side.

I've had the blue, red, black, white and lavender.The problem is that when you have a black car interior, black car seat covers and a black purse it is real easy to give yourself a coronary every time you can't find your Iphone - as I have. And I refuse to give up the Defender model since it is practically indestructable.This case is outstanding. The back has a lovely light brown to dark brown woodsy picture that has bright orange higlights around it. The front is bright orange surrounded by black. I cannot misplace it. And it isn't an obnoxious orange either. Unfortunately I am not a ""pink"" or ""yellow"" person, so those colors were not options. But I needed something bright, classy and Defender. Problem solved.I also like the fact that Otter Box upgraded the material for this case. It is no longer that stretchy, rubbery fabric that could not slide into my pants pocket without sticking, therefore making it impossible to just grab the phone when you needed it.  The case has a solid feel to it which is entirely in keeping with the point of owning a Defender.Okay so I had to make adjustments and buy some extender cables to connect my Iphone to various speakers and docking stations in my home.

It fits well, looks like it will do a nice amount of protection since it states it will provide shock absorbance, dust resistant (doubt that, all rubber cases attract dust) and scratch resistant, but I've had past experiences with otterbox cases for my past smartphones and all the cases I've owned did a great job. The only bad thing about this case is the installment of the case itself. The iPhone pops right into the rubber layer easily, but squeezing the phone into the hardshell case is a pain in the ass. It tells you on the directions to put the phone in the bottom first, then pushing it into the top. I've tried both ways (putting the phone in from the top and bottom) and both were really difficult to do. Once I put it in the bottom way, trying to push down on the phone so I could squeeze the top half of the phone into the top of the hard case was a pain in the ass as well. You have to literally bend the hard case over the top of the phone and try to get the lock button and headphone cover buttons into the holes without pushing the rubber part off the phone, which will happen. I've had to re-apply the case into the hard shell part numerous times, and I've finally gotten it right...I think. Another tiny problem that annoys me is the top right of the case of the phone doesn't seem ""snug"", it looks like the rubber part isn't fully inside the hard case. Overall, it's a great case and will do it's job but prepare for a hard time putting the hard shell case on the rubber part.",4.0,1350345600,"10 16, 2012",OtterBox Commuter Series Case for iPhone 4/4S  - Retail Packaging - Hot Pink/White,32.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41gaGcrpYfL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 585},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B005SUHRVC,A1F7YU6O5RU432,Angela Streiff,"[1, 1]","Most of the time my iPhone stays inside an Otterbox Defender case. However after trying out some other cases of other brands recently, that were all smaller more sleek cases, I decided to order a Otterbox Commuter case to try it out. It's significantly slimmer than the Defender, so I find it fits in my jeans pockets easier. Both the Defender and the Commuter use a 2 case design of one case fitted inside of another. The inner case of the Defender is hard plastic, with the outer case being soft rubber. The Commuter case is the opposite, having a soft case for the inside and a hard plastic case for the outside.Check to make certain when you order your case that you are getting it from Amazon themselves (might also say ""Fulfilled by Amazon""), if you want to be certain you are not buying a knock off fake. While the majority of 3rd party sellers here are probably selling the genuine thing, a number of recent negative experiences many have people have posted about in their reviews sounds as though one of the sellers was shipping out fakes. Real Otterbox cases are tough, and last a long time. They don't fall apart within days. If you're buying this and able to get it shipped to you using Amazon Prime Delivery or Amazon Super Saver Delivery, you are getting it from Amazon themselves and should receive the genuine case.I ordered the Hot Pink and White case, and I find it's a little lighter in color than the online photo shows. Online the case looks almost fuschia, but in hand it's a lighter shade. It comes with a screen protector you can apply to your iPhone touch screen, and it goes on quite well. All the buttons on my phone are easily accessed when it's in this case, and there are snug gaskets over the charging port and earphone port to help your phone resist being damaged should it come in contact with water. It's a cute case and I think I'll be ordering a second one in another color.

B005SUHRVC,A3LWC833HQIG7J,austin_Larry,"[0, 0]","I bought this for an iPhone 4 and it fits perfectly. I especially like the big cut out around the flash and camera. First case that does not distort flash pictures. The best feature is what seems like good protection (I don't drop phones to check out the protection) and very little bulk especially compared to the defender series. The mic flap works well. The flap over the power can be a bit annoying but loosens up with repeated use.What I did not like was the screen protector. Just bad. Bubbles galore and I have put on other screen protectors and none of them got near the amount of bubbles this one did. It could have been user error but I am pretty careful with getting screen protectors on. Also it doesnt feel that good to hold. Now that is a trade off as I am sure the Otter protection comes from the rigid plastic. But the plastic doesn't feel particularly good. The inner rubber case does feel good where you can grip that though.Bottomline is a good trade off for adding minimal size yet providing what seems to be good protection. It also looks nice. I would just have another brand of screen protector on hand.Update: From the department of irony. A friend wanted to see the case when we were out walking.

It fit well and protected equally well.  When I upgraded to the iPhone 4S, naturally I would get the Otterbox Commuter for my new phone.  It has been a huge disappointment.  The fit is awful.  The silicone keeps rolling off the iPhone frame and is peeling.  The plastic isn't the thick plastic I had on the 3GS but a much thinner plastic which has already cracked and broken off around the camera eye piece.

I love that it comes with a screen protector cause that way you don't have to buy it seperatly. The silicon layer is not really for protection, its just so the second layer doesn't ruin the phone. And then the polycarbonate is a strong layer that protects the phone very well. If you drop your phone, the screen will not crack because the case takes in all the impact. Unlike other very protective cases, this one isn't very wide which is great. It easily fits in my pocket. What I do not like though is the apple logo on the back of the phone is uncovered. It gets dirty and finger marks so I wish they covered it like in the defender series.

Everything about it has been just fine.The case is not too big, but one can definitely feel that it provides nice protection.  My only complaint is that I wish they did collegiate colors.I have grown somewhat clumsy in my dotage, and have dropped my iPhone 4S a couple of times.  Those drops have produced nary a scratch or crack in the glass.Well, about a month ago, the top lip of the hardshell developed a crack.  I have no idea why.  I kept the phone in my pants pocket, so that could explain the issue.  Then, after about 3 weeks, the top hardshell lip broke completely off.I made a warranty claim with Otterbox (via their website).  They sent me a couple of e-mails to confirm that I was an actual Otterbox owner, and then a few more e-mails.And then I received a brand new case in the mail today!Wow!  What customer service!!!Truth be told, this is about the third time Otterbox has treated me this way.

I was turned on to Otterbox last year for my Blackberry, and it worked like a charm.  After upgrading to an iPhone 4S, I did research online, checked many reviews, tried out cases in the store, and found the Otterbox Commuter to be the right one for me.It has a silicon inner case, with a hard plastic outer case.  I prefer the hard plastic outer, since its easier to get in and out of my pocket.  The rubber corners are a great trick for impact protection, although you won't find me doing drop tests off the roof of my car to the asphalt below.The clear plastic screen that came with the case was easy to apply and I can't even tell its on.My DW has been using the Otterbox Defender on her phone, which is fine for a purse person, but since my phone goes in my pants pocket, this slimmer version works for me.  From a fashion perspective, it seems to project the original shape and form of the iPhone, instead of masking it behind a much larger case.The ports on this phone, from which I primarily use just the charger, are easy to access and seem to get gunk like lint out of the connector.

B005SUHRVC,AYQKHM8O1G630,JJ,"[0, 0]","I love this case. It might not be the slimmest one around, nor the most glamorous looking but if you're a klutz, like me, it is WORTH IT! I am tall and therefore the height I drop it from is significant enough to do serious damage to the phone without a case or a flimsier case. I can attest to this because after almost two years of ownership, it has developed a small crack (the case, not the phone!) from all the dropping.I can fit it into my back pocket, it's not insanely huge and the silicone allows it to be grippier and prevent it from sliding all over smooth surfaces. It also increases the shock absorption and distribution when you drop it. A hard case can crack on impact and ruin your phone, a soft one might not be protection enough, this has both things.One thing that was kind of annoying, but something I anticipated after watching a review on youtube about this case, is that the silicone flap that over the charge port doesn't close all the way and the fact that the plastic portion might have a slightly imperfect fit over the silicone. You will get over this very quickly, it is not bothersome enough to interfere with anything. I'm pretty OCD about this stuff and I don't even notice it anymore.It is easy to take the phone in and out of the case and while for the most part your phone will be left with no marks, I DID end up having slight marks on the metal band around the phone where the volume and power buttons are. This is part of normal wear and tear, I'm not too concerned.I've dropped my phone off tables, couches, onto linoleum and cement and it's been just fine in this case.

When I first got this case I was really pleased with it. It fit very nicely and also looked nice. The first drop the plastic cracked at the top corner near the ear bud jack. It did protect the phone, but the case got loose on that top corner. Then I took it off to put a screen protector on and went to put it back on and you have to bend the plastic on the case a little to get it over the top rubber buttons covering the ear bud jack and on button. I did this and the whole upper third of the case snapped off. Now i put the case on successfully two or three other times before, but this time it snapped. And looking at it the plastic is very thin and cheap, probably why it cracked the first time I dropped it. It's a nice case that looks good, but the plastic is made way too cheaply.

B005SUHRVC,AWPODHOB4GFWL,"Martin A Hogan ""Marty From SF""","[1, 1]","There are many Otter box's on the market, but this is probably one of the more cost effective for durability and function. The first inner layer is a robust silicone material which is durable and absorbs impact force along with the outer hard plastic layer that fits tightly. Most of the buttons: power, volume, headset input and the 30-pin plug are covered with the silicone. The camera and flash are given a wider window for easier cleaning for dust and debris and for picture clarity.  One poor note - the headphone 3.5mm plug is covered with the hole on the wrong side.The feel of the otter box is a little less slippery than most and definitely less bulky. It's really just a series of thin, but tough skins over your phone. There is no doubt that you can drop this and feel protected. The hard plastic outer sheath does not completely cover your iPhone like the others. Instead it has cut-outs to give just as much protection without excessive cove rage. It's simply better designed than previous models. Check out the price on other models and you'll see that this is on the lower end, but it doesn't skimp on quality.It also comes with a separate plastic clear cover along with a cleaning cloth and an installation card for those bubbles.

It provides a nice level of protection while still fitting in a typical uniform shirt pocket.  I found the Defender case to be too thick and rubbery to permit one to easily insert and remove the iPhone from a shirt or pants pocket.There is a little design flaw with this case, hence the four star rating.  The plastic frame at the bottom of the case in front of the docking port is a little too thin.  After putting this in my pocket upside down for ten days, the plastic piece in front of the docking port split in half.  It is just too thin to be tugged on when removing the case (and iPhone) from a pocket.

B005SUHRVC,A3H7IN7FW22Q7Z,Mister B,"[0, 0]","I really dig this case.  I originally considered an Otterbox Defender, but after comparing Defender and Commuter cases in the store, it looks like the Defender is about 1/8 to 3/16&#34; bigger in every dimension, including thickness.  I wanted it protected, but I didn't want it in a bubble.  Also, my wife as a 3GS defender, and the rainbow effect on the screen was unattractive.So I instead went with the commuter and a Zagg invisibleSHIELD case-friendly screen protector.  Let's just talk about the Otterbox, though:The silicone portion is not the gummy/sticky kind.  It's got a bit of rigidity to it, fits the phone correctly, and covers the charge port and headphone jack that flip back for easy access.  The silent/ring switch is exposed.  Volume/power buttons are covered and there are tactile bumps on their place.  The cameras (front and back) and home button are all totally exposed, which you can see in the pictures.  Also, a cut-out for the Apple logo is (amusingly) on the back as well so you can tell it's not one of those evil Android devices I've read about (I kid).It would have been nice if the volume + and - buttons were labeled, but up is above down.  Not a huge deal.  I find the sleep/power button difficult to press.  There's a lot of &#34;give&#34; to that button that wasn't there previously.  I took the phone back out of the case to make sure I hadn't broken the button or something (I hadn't).  Again, you get used to it and it's not a huge deal.  You learn to apply more pressure and just press on one side of the button instead of the middle.The outer plastic part is slick.  Literally.  I picked the phone up for the first time and it immediately slipped out of my hands and landed on the carpeted floor.  Easy to slide in and out of your pocket, but I wish it had a soft-touch texture or something on the sides to make it more of a sure thing to hold.It's kind of like an inside-out Defender, as the soft silicone is on the inside and the hard plastic is on the outside.  The Defender, as noted above, is silicone on the outside.Still, despite all my complaints, I feel that my phone is protected and secure without feeling super-big and bulky.  It adds maybe 3mm in each dimension (height, width, depth).  If you need less thickness, I'd argue that you are not really protecting your phone.  If you want more thickness, the Defender is there for you.",5.0,1359158400,"01 26, 2013",OtterBox Commuter Series Case for iPhone 4/4S  - Retail Packaging - Hot Pink/White,32.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41gaGcrpYfL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 585},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

I found that during my sons little league games dust gets in these areas so I bought this case.While I like the look and feel of the case I find that the fit isn't great.  The polycarbonate shell does not fit correctly in the cutouts in the rubber.  This causes a problem for the cover for the charging port.  I have to try to bend the polycarbonate piece so that the cover will stay.  It works ok, but definitely doesn't look as good as it does on the video review I watched on otter box.I have a couple of the otterbox defenders for the iPhone 4.  While they fit well, they cause a haze in the flash and the rubber outer layer has stretched out and I always struggle to get the cover for the charging port to stay put.I like that the commuter is easy to get in and out of my pocket like the speck candyshell does and there isn't a lot of added bulk.  The defender is a struggle to get in and out of your poket.  You do loose the grip created by the rubber outer layer on the defender.  The outer layer on the commuter is pretty slick.

B005SUHRVC,A3S73VLN1KOGEY,Ms. Sean Crenwelge,"[51, 63]","I have had an iPhone for about 3 years now and have gone through so many cases. I've had the iFrogz Luxe Case, SwitchEasy CapsuleRebel M Menace Hybrid Case, and the Agent18 EcoShield Slider; my boyfriend also had the Otterbox Defender. Although each of these cases has perks, they all have drawbacks. I see many more pros with the Commuter Series from OtterBox than I have seen with any other iPhone case.For starters, the case is not bulky. When comparing it to the Defender, it wins hands down. The defender was awkward, bulky, and came with a holster clip that most girls won't use. Yes, this case would be handy if you were possibly in the construction business or if you really had a problem with dropping your phone, but for my needs, it didn't fit the bill. The Commuter case has a soft inside and a hard exterior, and they come in two different colors. This is both appealing and functional. The soft rubber casing allows for a no-slip grip and shock absorber and the hard shell keeps it from being too sticky. It is comfortable in the hand and provides the perfect balance of rubber to hard shell casing.I have dropped my phone a few times and the case has held up well, I can't see any wear on it. However, I have noticed that the soft shell (my color is yellow) does show discoloration. My hard shell is gray and you can see gray spots all throughout my yellow case. While this is not a big deal to me, it is just something I thought was worth mentioning. The Commuter Series in my opinion is superior to all other iPhone cases I have owned and, for $22, I think it's worthy of protecting the iPhone.",5.0,1326585600,"01 15, 2012",OtterBox Commuter Series Case for iPhone 4/4S  - Retail Packaging - Hot Pink/White,32.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41gaGcrpYfL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 585},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

The only downfall, which is kinda important, is the white softer portion is already discoloring (from absorbing the dirt from our hands). This is an awesome case, and I highly recommend an otterbox, it doesn't add much bulk, keeps the headphone and charging ports protected from dust, but keep the coloring in mind when ordering (mom got the purple/white one if it doesn't say that anywhere, I ordered the blue with a lighter blue softer shell, mine is showing discoloring too, but less noticeable because its not white).

B005SUHRVC,AGE0P3241ZW3E,Nancy,"[0, 0]","I got the Commuter Otterbox case the day before my new iPhone 4s came. I've been debating for a few days on whether to get the Defender or the Commuter and after doing some research, I have decided to get the Commuter. The Defender is nice and seems super durable, but honestly I do not drop my phone that often and I am usually good with my phones, except for the occasional accidents I drop it every once in awhile. Also, the Defender is too bulky for my taste. One reason I got the iPhone was for its sleekness and the Defender would have ruined that feature for me. Since I do not want to compromise the sleekness of the phone, but also want great protection and knowing I take good care of my phones, the Commuter seemed like a good compromise.I will admit, putting on the case took a bit of effort first. You definitely have to ""massage"" the phone in the case a little since you are trying to make it line up with all the buttons/switches with the silicone case and the hard plastic cover. I am a perfectionist so when I saw that it was not lining up correctly, I kept fidgeting with it or took the phone out and tried it all over again. The trick is to slide the bottom part in first and then press on the top part to snap it into place (just like the video on otterbox.com) Before I was doing the opposite so I felt kind of dumb that I did not just look at the video first (haha). I can reach all of the buttons and switches fine and the flaps for the usb/charger connector and the headphones stay in place when I tuck them in. I can see some people with big fingers having trouble trying to switch the silence on/off, so keep that in mind if it is a big deal for you.I am not really sure why some reviewers said their case is not lining up correctly with their phone or the phone just does not fit with the case. I am looking at my phone with the case on and it is all secure and tight. I do not have the screen protector that came with it on, but I am sure I will need to soon so I do not regret it later.Like I said before, if you're clumsy, just get the Defender and you will not have to worry about your phone at all. If you are usually mindful with your phone, get the Commuter. I have not dropped my phone on concrete or anything like that yet (fingers crossed!) but if I do end up letting it happen, I will update!UPDATE!Ok, so I've had this case for a little over a month and my iPhone is still sitting pretty in it. I just dropped my phone today on tile when it slipped out of my hands because I was fiddling around with my handbag. Oh my god was I happy that nothing happened to my phone or case! I still say this case is a great buy, I mean 20 bucks to protect a $200 phone is pretty nice! I'm never letting this phone out of its case when I'm out. If it wasn't for this case, my phone will be shattered!Only negatives about this case is it takes a bit to get the phone to fit in the case, but you get used to it after a few times. Also, the lock/unlock button and volume buttons are somewhat hard to press down easily since the silicone covers them, but you get used to that as well.Happy hunting for the right case everyone!",5.0,1332028800,"03 18, 2012",OtterBox Commuter Series Case for iPhone 4/4S  - Retail Packaging - Hot Pink/White,32.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41gaGcrpYfL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 585},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

I must have sat in such a way that it contorted the case and stressed the corner which is where the brittle plastic snapped. Prior to that I was disappointed that the rubber that goes around the screen is thin and flimsy and it would often come off or get stuck under the lip of the case. That issue got worse over time. On the plus side this case is easy to put together and has a nice firm feel to it.

Although the defender case provides great protection, it has flaws; so when it was time to replace it I decided to purchase this commuter series case.Although this case does not provide the same level of protection as the defender series case, I believe it is adequate for most, and excels in areas that the defender falls short.  This case is slimmer and better looking (in my opinion), it's not a lent magnet (the defender is), and the hard plastic exterior allows it to slid in and out of your pocket easily (I huge plus for me).The biggest draw back is that the buttons that are covered by the case sleep/power button and volume up/down are very difficult to press with this case on. My hope is that it will become easier as it is broken in.  Also the screen protector that was included with mine did not go on very well. It does appear to be a good quality screen protector and is easy to install, but the top portion (above the front facing camera) will not stick down properly, as if it does not have adhesive on that area. I don't think this is a design flaw, I think I just got a bad one.So overall I'm happy with the protection and the look of the case, but only time will tell if the buttons function better after break in.

It didn't come at a blazing speed but I didn't bother getting mad at that.-First impressions were that it was easy to install but was bulkier than advertised but not by too much. Just don't think it's going to retain a sleek look. Was pretty happy with it until I realized it won't fit in a dock at all and the headphones won't go in. Was still not going to freak out cause I figured it was the price to pay for protecting my awesome phone.-Fast forward a couple weeks. Found a few new annoyances. 1)The snap in protector for the charging slot won't stay in. 2) The lip on the side gets in the way in landscape mode when texting/gaming (kind of). 3) when I pulled off the case I realized that the silicone is letting in (and trapping) all kinds of dirt and grime. Now I pull it off every couple of days and soak the case in soapy water for a while. Also it just looks like a redneck or a child's case compared to how everyone else has their phone.- So to wrap it up finally.. Unless all you're after is paranoia protection and nothing else, show off your phone a little more and get a wrap and bumper or slim case. Apple is a much better designer than otterbox and it'll get just as dirty with or without it.

It provides me with sufficient protection for my iPhone without adding too much bulk.I had the OtterBox Defender Series case before this one, and while that case probably does offer a bit more protection, it adds a LOT of bulk. And, I also did not like the OtterBox Defender Series case's port covers. Specifically, the main port cover at the bottom of the case. It was always very difficult to get it to close properly, and I eventually just cut it off with a pair of scissors.Now, with that said, while I found this Commuter Series case to provide ample protection for me, IF you are someone who frequently drops their phone, you may still want to consider the Defender Series case, as again, it is clearly a much beefier case.For me, this OtterBox Commuter Series case is perfect.

B005SUHRVC,A1BQAODS9D6PSU,Zachary A. Rose,"[1, 1]","So first off, this is not a terrible case.  It has a nice form factor, appears very well made, and provides ample protection, including a small bumper which protrudes to protect the screen, which I consider essential and is missing from many other &#34;slim&#34; cases.  (Admittedly I never dropped my phone in the case so I can't vouch for it being as protective as it appears.)  Unfortunately I do have some quibbles which makes me unable to recommend this case for the $20 I paid for it.1) The case is actually two separate parts, a silicone inner section and a hard plastic shell.  This is a somewhat awkward system and I wonder about it's purpose as it doesn't appear that you could use either part separately, so why make them as separate pieces.  In any case, it makes putting your phone into the case MUCH more difficult.  It took me probably ten minutes to get my phone lodged in there properly, and I was worried all the while that something was going to rip.  If you dont change cases often this isn't a huge deal but it is bothersome.2) The hard plastic shell is oddly slippery.  I know this doesn't seem too bad, but considering how often I'm holding my phone I could easily imagine it being a sizable annoyance.3)  This is more of a recommendation, it looks terrible if you're using it with a white phone (If it's the black case.)  I thought it might look good but it was actually very unattractive to have the black case with my white ipod.

B005SUHSN4,A1QYE76M7E4ZK4,Tracy,"[0, 0]","Firstly, this is MUCH closer to a maroon than a 'plum' color. That's fine, but I was hoping for a case that was less bulky but still protective. This doesn't feel any less bulky than the Commuter series case that I already have. It is, as others have said, impossible to put the case on with a screen protector in place. Can't do it, no way, no how. The case is also not 'grippy' at ALL. Some people may not like that the phone can easily slide around on a hard surface. What's more, the buttons are hard to push, requiring quite a lot of pressure, when covered by the case. The opening for the sync cable at the bottom is quite deep, so anything short of the slim iPhone sync cord that came with the case won't fit. On the plus side, unlike many other 'slide on' cases that are made in this fashion, Otterbox has taken care to line the insides with a thin felt, to prevent scratching of the phone itself (as it is a VERY snug fit). If you dislike the silicone/rubbery casings on the Commuter series, and want a snug fitting case, this is probably the way to go, but it's not a significantly less bulky case compared to the commuter series. One very positive thing I noticed, however, is that the screen protectors that are included have been changed so that they do not impede the prox sensor on the white iPhone.",3.0,1326758400,"01 17, 2012",OtterBox Reflex Series Case for iPhone 4S,39.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41w%2BzSVhzXL._SX342_.jpg,,OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

I think Otterbox has the best protection out there and it does what it was designed to do: Protect your phone but the draw back (in addition to making the phone look generic smarthphone) is that it creates wavy rainbows throughout the screen (think that 70s show) that can be seen and will bug  you if you're like me and like your phone to have a solid color screen. It's a lot more visible when the phone is off or on and looked at from an angle.

However, being super thin, the Razr can wear some beefy protection and not feel like a brick in your hand.  The Commuter does it for me.  The interior silicone wrap serves as a bumper and shock absorber, while the hard case makes an already sturdy phone feel rock solid.  With the commuter case, the Razr becomes about as thick as a naked Droid X or Bionic.  I also find the phone stays in my pockets a little better with the case on--without, it is so thin and slippery, it can slide out of a pocket if you sit the wrong way .All the ports are covered but easily accessible by silicon flaps that tuck into the hard shell, except the SD/SIM card slot.  This to me is the one down side--you have to removve the case to access the SD card.  If this fixed, 5  stars easy. The power and volume rockers are completely covered, yet still easy to press.  The screen side has a silicon edge around it, making it impossible to lay the glass down on a flat surface.

The phone is truly amazing but definitely any phone inside a cover is never the same. The phone feels better in the pocket now. The cover doesnt add too much thickness to the phone, its still comparable to galaxy nexus without cover. There is no opening for the microSD and SIM card slot in the cover.

The volume rocker and switch off buttons are nice and easy to recognize with the cover on them.Protection - Looks like this cover will provide sufficient protection from minor falls. atleast u dont have to worry about it each time you put the phone on any surface or throw it in the bag. Initially, its a little hard to put on the cover and it doesnt come out easily too, making it feel more secure inside. After a couple of times, it will be easier to take out as you get used to it.Grip - I have not had any issues in gripping the phone, the back is slightly textured and definitely the cover never slips from the hand or the pocket.Screen Protector - Not that great.

B006JO232E,A1CPRP3VFJRS1R,M. Anderson,"[0, 1]","Otterbox makes the best cases for phones that I've ever found.  This case works for the Samsung Galaxy Nexus phone, which you can buy unlocked for GSM networks worldwide from Google for $349.00.  There is also a proprietary version from Verizon and Sprint, which I assume that this case will work with as well.The case consists of four parts.There are two hard plastic pieces that you snap around your phone.  One hard piece is for the front of your phone and the other is for the back of your phone.  The front piece includes an integrated clear plastic screen protector.After you snap those two pieces together around your phone, you then wrap the third piece, a soft rubber shell around the hard pieces.  The soft rubber piece acts to conceal the seams on the hard plastic pieces, to add additional impact protection, and to make it harder to drop the phone.The last piece is a hard plastic belt holder, which can also be used as a hard plastic cover for the front of the phone.  This piece is entirely optional.  You can use it, or just put it into the drawer.  The phone will snap into and out of this piece in either direction, so you can have the phone on your belt facing inwards (screen protected) or outwards (screen visible).  I prefer to keep the belt clip portion clipped onto my backpard, with the screen outward, so I can use the phone while it's clipped onto my bag.The whole case shows a high degree of design intelligence.  It provides the ultimate in protection for your phone, and has the bulk necessary to achieve that goal.If you want a great case that is less bulky, Otterbox also makes a version for this phone called the Commuter, which is thinner and offers no belt clip and no integrated screen protector.  However, it still offers a very high level of protection.",5.0,1346457600,"09 1, 2012",OtterBox Defender Series for Samsung Galaxy Nexus,49.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41K%2BC5aLn%2BL._SX342_.jpg,,OtterBox,"[['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"
B006JO232E,A2K5RRMPICZ606,Nathaniel Allen,"[99, 101]","UPDATES AT THE BOTTOM -- possible extended battery problem...Just want to start off this review with a disclaimer: Otterbox Defenders are known to be bulky compared to the ""skin"" style cases such as the popularDiztronic Flexible TPU Case. This review is written with that in mind -- I'm not knocking this case's size, because we're all aware of that going in.And in answer to another question that is sure to arise, YES, this case is compatible with theSamsung Galaxy Nexus 2100mAh Extended Battery & Cover. The extended battery comes with a replacement back for the phone that results in perhaps an extra millimeter of thickness, making the fit of the Otterbox Defender snug, but just so. It fits.If you're in love with the subtle curve of the Nexus' screen, a word of warning: this case makes it disappear. As you can see from the photos I've added, there is a slight curve evident when the phone is set, face down, on a flat surface. But the bulk of the case really makes the phone appear to be dead flat up front. The back, however, attempts to maintain a bit of the tapered curve, and even has nicely rounded edges that make this monster more comfortable and natural to hold.The case is actually four components, as follows:1. There's a hard plastic ""inner"" case that is actually two pieces, a front and a back that snap together around the phone. This hard plastic has cutouts appropriate for the display screen, front & rear cameras + flash, LED notification, speakers & mic, prox sensor, headphone & MHL (USB) port, plus the volume rocker and power button.2. Glued into the hard plastic case is a ""thicker-than-mylar, thinner-than-a-credit-card"" screen protector. That's right, it's a rigid plastic screen protector, and it can't be swapped out.3. The whole plastic shell is wrapped by a substantial silicone boot. The edges of the boot engage with a channel around the face of the plastic shell to ""lock it in"" and, for the most part, give it a very integrated look. The boot has two very pronounced solid block protrusions that carry button presses down to the power and volume switches on the phone. Cutouts are present for front and rear mics, camera & flash, rear speaker. Silicone flaps cover the MHL and 3.5mm audio jack, and these flaps are held securely closed by channels on the hard plastic shell. The back of the rubber is lightly textured for improved finger grip. The boot itself is soft and not overly sticky/grippy -- in fact, a little ""slippery."" So it doesn't give me too much of a problem in my pockets whereas some silicone cases tend to grip pocket material -- as in the actual cloth in my pants or jacket -- making inserting or retrieving my phone a nuisance, and collecting pocket lint in the process. The Otterbox boot *mostly* doesn't have a problem with that.4. Lastly, there's the holster, which is, in fact, optional. The phone snaps in securely, either facing out or facing in, and the spring loaded belt clip rotates a full 360 to allow the whole contraption to be worn in any orientation. To round things out, the holster doubles as a desktop stand and holds the phone in a not-quite vertical landscape orientation, for media consumption.One benefit of having a phone as thin as theGalaxy Nexusis that a relatively bulky case such as this can be fitted without causing the phone to resemble a paperback book. And without the holster, my rubberized Nexus still slides easily into pant, jean and coat pockets.But let's talk about some of the negatives:- The holster blocks the 3.5mm audio jack -- so no wired headphones if you're using it as a desktop stand.- The case covers the 3-pin connector on the side of the phone. But considering the phone with *any* case will never fit into a Samsung desktop dock or vehicle mount that might make use of those connectors, it's a bit of a moot point.- I've noticed the hard plastic frame around the screen obstructs the movement of icons and widgets to the next left screen on my Home page. It's just in the way by maybe a millimeter, causing me to have to ""re-grab"" the icon closer to its right edge to be able to force it on over to that next page. A minor annoyance that doesn't affect day-to-day use, except for when I'm rearranging icons & widgets.- The cutout surrounding the camera lens & flash is a finger magnet. I almost wish this came with a removable plug to provide protection in day-to-day use, because having a recessed, oily camera lens is not good for snapping pics.- The silicone cover is just every-so-slippery, and with the extra weight added to the phone (mine now weights 210 grams / 7.4 ounces with the case + extended battery), if I'm sitting around lazily ingesting a longer YouTube clip, the phone tends to want to droop a little out of my grip.- The mic port cutout in the boot is just every so slightly misaligned. This hasn't caused a muffled audio problem on the other end of my calls that anyone has pointed out, but the potential is there. It would be easy to correct with some precise work with a razor blade.- I don't want to knock the integrated screen saver too much, but it has these faults:(1) It collects lint and dust underneath (between the screen protector and the screen)(2) It has a slight, slight unevenness to it -- I can feel a ""wave"" as I run my fingertip across its length(3) It is not independently replaceable if I scratch or damage it, and there's no way I'm going to slap a stick-on screen protector over it!(4) It is a fingerprint magnet, especially in contrast to the bare Nexus screen, which incorporates a oil-resistant coating(5) There is a slight rainbow discoloration to it at certain viewing angles and/or brightnesses, AND it makes off-angle reading slightly fuzzyBut in day to day use, the Otterbox screen protector is very invisible to me. I'm impressed that this hunk of clear plastic sitting between me and my phone doesn't present itself as more of an obstruction.And that can be said for the Otterbox Defender case as a whole. Yeah, there's no getting around its bulk. But it has a level of finish that is betrayed by its size, and I trust it to keep my silicon, glass and plastic toy from getting too banged up -- because I know those few accidental drops my last phone survived are only going to be rougher on a phone with a screen this size.+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +Update September 2012:During the first few months of use of this case (and the Galaxy Nexus on the 4.0.1 ICS operating system), I began experiencing an increasing number of lockups where I had to remove the Otterbox case to perform a battery pull to reset the phone. This took a toll on the case, and eventually the tabs that hold the two halves together chipped off and no longer held.At the end of March, I contacted Otterbox, who collected some basic information, and sent me a replacement case.The replacement case seemed every bit identical to the original. Despite what I read online about Otterbox slightly modifying the case for something or other, the rep I worked with assured me that they hadn't -- and there was no evidence that anything was different, i.e. no changes to model or version numbers stamped on the case. Oh, and the screen protector on this one was perfectly flat -- gone was that ""wave"" I mentioned in my review.About this time, I updated my OS to 4.0.4 and the lockups stopped, so the phone has been more-or-less sealed in the case, with the exception of 3 times I've removed it to show the naked phone to somebody.This third time removing it, I was surprised to find all but one of the tabs broken. It appears that the only thing holding the case together was the exterior boot. I haven't abused the case, and can only suspect the pressure from the extended battery cover is contributing to these tabs breaking.",4.0,1324598400,"12 23, 2011",OtterBox Defender Series for Samsung Galaxy Nexus,49.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41K%2BC5aLn%2BL._SX342_.jpg,,OtterBox,"[['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B006ZOC6SE,A1IGCUY11IG8I2,Daeanaira,"[128, 129]","I bought this case for my brand new AT&T; iphone 4S (white). My BF has the Verizon version, and the case fits both. I was a little worried when I ordered it because one review said the headphone jack hole was in the wrong place and that it actually isn't for the 4S after all. That is not true.There is a hole at the top of the case - for the microphone. The headphone jack is appropriately covered with a flap to avoid introducing dust and debris into the hole when it is not in use. All of the other holes, buttons, flaps, etc line up as you would expect. The buttons can be pressed easily through the raised portions of the case and the flaps can be opened and closed without issue, once you learn where they all are. = )The description and picture don't really do the case justice. The blue plastic is a vibrant ocean blue (nearly teal), the purple is a dark purple, but not quite plum or eggplant. It looks great with my white iphone, but also looked great with my boyfriend's black one. Please note, however, that the opening about the back camera/flash has BLACK plastic and not blue. This may be to avoid reflective issues with the flash, and does not detract from the case in any way - even with a white iphone.The case is solidly constructed and pieced together in such a manner than none of the pieces could accidentally come apart without either major breakage or purposeful intent.The screen has a built in screen protector, which works well even with the second one I have underneath it (yes, I am paranoid and clumsy). The back hole exposing the apple logo also has a plastic protector. The only places the phone is even remotely exposed when all flaps are in place are: around the bottom speakers, the top microphone, the front speaker/sensor/camera area and the back camera/flash area. The exposed areas are as minimal as necessary and do not make me feel that the case would not fully protect the phone.The case is slightly grippy and does not slip easily, but does not appear to attract lint easily, either. The screen does not have an overly plasticy feel and wipes clean easily. Although the clear film could be scratched, it would not be done so with incredible ease.The case does add bulk to the phone. There is no getting around that. I do not find the bulk to be prohibitive, but I almost never carry my phone in my pocket. I'm not an engineer, builder or mathematician, but I would say it increases the size by about 25-30%. This is not a lot when you stick the phone in a bag or purse, but might make a difference if sticking it in a pocket. The phone also come with a black belt clip. The belt clip adds somewhat more bulk, but the phone can be placed inside with the screen pointed in or out, depending on if you value protection or convenience. The clip on the belt clip also rotates so that you can wear the phone vertically or horizontally, depending on your preference.Please note that some descriptions say the case is felt lined. That is not true. It has a pad inside that covers about 75% of the back plastic - most likely to help cushion the phone, stop the case from scratching the phone, and to help with heat distribution. But the case is not lined in any way on the inside.Last, but not least, there were some reviews (for other colors) that state one of two things are detractors: 1) That the case causes sound irregularities, such as lower volume or echoing OR 2) That the case interferes with the camera and/or flash. Well, I don't know what other people are doing, but I do not find either of those statements to be true. I tested both the earphone and speakerphone with and without the case and found no issues. I also took pics with both the front and rear camera before and after placing the case and found no issues there either.So far, I really like the case.

This case, being so tight and a slide on, is incompatible with the Zagg. It's impossible to get on with both the front and the back Zagg applied, and is very difficult to install with just the front installed.. plus it peels up the protector if you're not careful.The second deal breaker for me was the port opening on the bottom. I use an aftermarket 5' charger at work, and the charging port opening is too narrow for it to fit my cord. No bueno.Otherwise, cool looking case in the transparent clear, would probably look really cool in one of the colored transparents with a white iPhone. Quality seemed great. But everyone's wants and needs are different and this one just didn't work out for me. I'll be going back to my trusty Commuter series.",3.0,1349308800,"10 4, 2012",OtterBox Reflex Series Case for iPhone 4/4S - Retail Packaging - Clear,34.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41w4ngxHjWL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 16808},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

Typically, I buy the full body case that completely covers my iphone because I am hard on my electronics and prefer to purchase something that I know will protect my $400+ investment.This particular case assembles very easily, but I am skeptical of how easily it will stay together. It comes loose once in a while, and I wonder if it might come apart. The back side (where it snaps together) closes with a ""click"" sound, letting you know that it's secure. When it moves slightly, I get slightly concerned of it's ability to keep my cell phone safe.Only parts of this phone cover is rubberized (the black parts), the rest is hard plastic.

B007WT9KAI,A1MWTILB9DZSLZ,R. Gibson,"[0, 0]","I previously had an OtterBox Commuter case on my iPhone 4S. At first, I loved it as well...however, a year later, after a few drops and putting it in and pulling it out of my pocket a few thousand times, the hard shell started cracking and the silicone liner started getting pretty sloppy.This Reflex case I found to be slightly loose on my iPhone with only a screen protector. However, I found that after installing a scratch protector on the back of the phone, it shimmed up thick enough that this case now fits very snugly, and I feel much more confident with it. I was surprised that such a thin layer would make that much difference, but it really did.I really like how much smoother and solid the phone feels now. The Commuter case had nice ""grip,"" but the soft, grippy sections and many plastic edges made it challenging to get in and out of my pockets easily. The Reflex case on the other hand is nice and smooth, yet has just enough texturing to feel solid in my hand.I feel fairly confident that this case will hold up better than the Commuter did, and will serve me well for at least another year. I will update this review after I've used it for a while and see how it holds up and how much protection it offers.UPDATE:I have been using this case for about 4 months now, and am very happy with it. I did have to drill out the speaker jack opening a bit in order to get ALL headphone plugs to work. Not a big deal though. Also, I just dropped my phone on the asphalt from 6 feet in the air for the first time, and the only damage was a scratch on the case. No cracks or breaks, and the phone still works perfectly.

They protect my phone like no other; I trust them to keep my spendy device SAFE AND SOUND. I however have never paid over 35 dollars for an OB, but when I came upon this adorable case I had to splurge. Unfortunately I wasted my money, and here is why:The case was dirty in a matter of hours, of course due to the light color of the box. Naive I was, maybe, but you figure &#34;Otterbox&#34; + &#34;50 dollars&#34; would somehow prove anyone wrong.And the worst thing of all was that the white design began to chip off in a matter of a couple of days! Now, I could deal with the grime because cleaning the case is possible but the design chipping away ruined the case for me.(YES, it kept my phone safe the way an Otterbox should, but obviously I bought this item for more than just the quality of the protection; I also had wanted an adorable color/design to show off as well.)I used it for a week tops, and you know what? I would not even try to sell/give/or even borrow this case to anyone due to the fact that it looks like I had had it for months opposed to just a few days. Don't buy this case unless you happen to have 50 dollars laying around to basically light on fire.I would, however, take 35 of those 50 dollars and still buy an Otterbox.

Doesn't appear to show dirt that easily as I've had it for over a month.  Just wish it wasn't so bulky - I miss seeing the slim design of the iPhone itself.  But I also understand that since I want gravity protection, it's going to have to be a bulky case.

I know it seems silly and expensive, however if you treasure your Iphone's health as much as I do mine, there's nothing you won't do to protect it. And bar none, the Otterbox Defender case is the very best - hands down. Don't get me wrong, till now the Realtree was fine except that when the phone was face down in my black purse, black car seat cover or dark drawer, it could be a few seconds before I would locate it and my heart could resume beating. Not anymore.I have to say that the moment I put this new, gorgeous blue exterior case over my orange one it was like magic.  Not only will I have no trouble locating my phone anywhere, but when I do it is even more beautiful then before. The orange design on the back perfectly complements the orange case within.I only wish that Amazon could encourage Otterbox to sell the individual components so that consumers could mix and match colors without having to buy a whole unit (and get yet another holster for my junk drawer).As for the owners out there who are concerned with the slight difference in blue coloring - I have no idea what they're talking about.

My teenage daughter wore her case out for her iPhone 4S after over a year, and asked for a new one.  She found this one on Amazon and asked if she could get this designer one, instead of the normal Otterbox Defenders that I slap on my family's devices.  I agreed and purchased this about 4 months ago.The first thing I noticed is that this case started to show wear within the first month.  Her old one didn't show wear for nearly 6 months.  About 2 weeks ago, we were able to accidentally test the protection aspect of this particular case...and it failed miserably.  We have these huge beanbags in our house (made by Lovesac), and that is wear my daughter sits.  When an adult is on one of the beanbags, the highest point to the ground is maybe 3 feet.  She laid her phone on the edge of the beanbag and continued to watch the movie we were viewing.  I had a birds-eye view of the phone from my chair, and saw it slide off when she shifted in the beanbag.  Remember, I said slid off, not dropped.  It slid off the beanbag and landed on the side of the case on the tile floor from about 30&#34;-36&#34; off the ground.  I could tell by the sound of the impact that we probably had a problem.  When I picked the phone up, I could see the shattered screen.  I have dropped my phone in normal Otterbox Defender cases from that height and higher a number of times and never had an issue.  I can't understand why this mild drop resulted in a shattered screen.Oddly enough, just the other night my wife's iPhone 4S in a &#34;normal&#34; Otterbox Defender case took an identical tumble from the same spot, and there wasn't even a blemish on the phone....

B0085JRQFU,A1G5FHPI3IBMOU,,"[0, 0]","This OtterBox Commuter is really nice case offering a sleek 2 piece design and great protection for your GS3.  The screen protector that comes with the case has done well.  I had a plastic irrigation pipe to slide across my screen and did slightly scratch the screen protector which sucks, but that saved my phone's screen which is great.  Can easily replace the screen protector.  I must admit, I am happy with the case and it's protection characteristics, however, I can't give it 5 stars because my only complaint of the case is that it is too slippery in hand for my taste and I have large hands.  The phone can and will slip out of your hand easier to me than without a case.  Go figure.  My wife has a GS3 also and uses the OtterBox Defender which is bulkier than the Commuter, but the Defender case has significantly more grip in hand and feels more secure, but it is bulkier.  That is the trade off I suppose.  If OtterBox put the same grip on the sides of the Commuter, this case would be a +5 Star.  But as it stands, I can only give it a 4 Star.  I actually would give it a 3.5 stars if I could give 1/2 stars, so I rounded up instead of down.  The slippery and less secure feel is my complaint and for me it is enough to reduce star count for the case.

It is true that the rubber inside fits great for the S3 and the hard plastic snaps on nicely. But part of using your phone ALL day is constantly having to use your ""buttons"".I use my power button to bring my phone out of screen saver mode (screen turns black) and back into it. At this point I am now using my black button at the bottom of the screen for ""unlocking"" my phone (bringing out of screen save mode) and I still have to use the power button to go back into screen save mode (due to not having a choice beside just waiting for the phone to go into screen save by default, but that waste battery life). This button does require more than normal effort to press down on to work. Anyone saying otherwise has really powerful hands.  It is so bad, that I tried removing it a couple of times and putting it back on to make sure it wasn't just how I was putting it on.Now as person who brings this phone to work and uses Pandora alot, I find that I have to use my volume buttons A LOT. This is also very bad due to the fact that they to are just same and need a lot of pressure to work.  This is also multiplied due to the fact that I wear this phone inside a workout armband (which this case obviously doesn't help since it makes it way to big for the case (that is the case maker fault, not the otter box)). To press buttons while in the armband is just to frustrating. Make sure you set your volume and things BEFORE you put it into any type of workout band.The stars I've given is due to how well I think it will protect the phone (because I'm not going to act like I know it will protect it (and I'm not going to go throwing my phone down on the ground)), how well it fits, and it's functions. This is truly how people should be rating this. The funniest part to me is all the 5 stars that actually complain about the buttons.

Although the phone was covered under an accidental damage warranty (something I don't usually buy or need), I wouldn't be eligible for another replacement for a long time.  I needed to protect the replacement phone as best I could, so I picked up the OtterBox case.The case arrives in three pieces.  The first is a screen protector, which I chose not to install.  The second is a flexible rubber cover that goes over the phone.  The third is a hard plastic case that goes over the rubber case.  Once all this installed, the phone is about twice as thick as it was.  I'm not crazy about that, but I need the protection so I live with it.Once installed, the case covers up the various ports on the phone to keep dust out of them.  The port covers are part of the flexible rubber piece.  They open and close easily, and &#34;lock&#34; into place when closed.  Because the case covers up the buttons for power and volume control, you have to press a bit harder than normal to get the flexible rubber &#34;buttons&#34; to make contact with the real buttons underneath.  This is both good and bad.  It's good in that this makes it a lot harder to press the buttons by mistake.  It's bad in that it's simply a bit harder to press the buttons in general.  Again, part of the price you pay for protection.On balance, I am very happy with the case and the protection it offers.  There are, however, a couple of things I don't like about it.  First, the hard plastic case is a bit slippery to hold on to, even though it's got a &#34;rough&#34; finish to it.  I've found the phone slipping from my hands while holding it.  It would be nice if they rubberized the back of it.  Second, the case is hard to remove.  If you have a situation where the phone has locked up and needs to have the battery removed, you've got to struggle a bit with the hard plastic shell to get it off the inner rubber case. Then you remove that, then the back of the phone, and finally the battery.  That's a lot of work.  Fortunately, the GS3 is a very well-made, reliable phone that rarely needs this treatment.  If I was a frequent traveler who had to carry spare batteries with me to get through the day, I might think about replacing this with a case that is easier to put on and off the phone.

The fit of the hard case is so snug though that its very difficult to do that. When getting the phone into the case the phone must have powered on and off three times and it eventually ended up in &#34;safe mode&#34; (due to a combo of buttons being pressed simultaneously - which caused me to remove the case and pull the battery to get out of safe mode).I'm still having issues with the volume keys working sporadically, but the effort and the results of taking the case off to re-position the rubber sleeve is not worth it.

This one (OtterBox Commuter Case) appeared to be slim -- and it really is. I'm not gentle with my phone so this was mandatory for me. Just know that the case will protect your phone from scratches, but you're on your own when it comes to the screen. It comes with a plastic stick on shield that will protect the screen from scratches but don't think it will work magic if you were to accidentally smash your phone. Unless of course it lands face up. It's worth it .... I dropped my phone within the first week, but thanks to the otter it was fine.

B0085JRQFU,A1U22BSC4ZGABT,Chad,"[1, 1]","I got this case for my dad who wanted a protective case. Immediately the first thing that came to mind was Otterbox. After looking through a few cases, we decided on this one. Being a little more tech savvy, I went ahead and put it on for him. When I did, I noticed a few things. With the following being said, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants that extra layer (or two) of protection for their new S3, as there are more pros than cons in my opinion.PROS:1. Overall, it is a well made case that does offer two layers of protection, a gel inner layer and a hard outer layer. I figure that this will do its job very well, protecting against minor falls.2. For the amount of protection that this case provides, it is surprisingly thin. The phone itself is pretty large, but even with the case on it still fits comfortably in my pocket. Plus it looks and feels good in the hands.3. This one can go both ways. But I liked the fact that all the ports (micro USB & headphone jack) had a detachable covering on them. I feel that this adds to the protection aspect, as well as deters dirt or lint from coming in the phone.CONS:1. The gel skin is pretty thick. When you try to press the power button, or even the sound rocker, you're gonna need a bit more force. I found myself pressing more than I thought I'd need to just to get the phone to turn on and off.

B0085JRQFU,AWHL379EE14K7,C. Pilot,"[1, 1]","This is overall a nice case for the Samsung Galaxy S3.  This is my wife's phone, so it only had to satisfy her, but I'll add my own observations, too.The included screen protector was easy to install (I've never really had a problem installing screen protectors), and fits the phone well.  Since the edges of the screen are curved, the screen protector does not go all way to the frame edge (it would keep peeling up if it did), but the lip of the rubber case comes pretty close to covering that.The case itself was relatively easy to install.  I watched a YouTube video before attempting it, and before you attempt to install it yourself, I would advise doing the same because the video shows the easiest way to get it installed.Overall, the case works well and is designed nicely.  About the only ""Con"" I observed is that the volume and power buttons are rather difficult to push now.  For those wanting to know, the rubber part of the case is a true light purple color, but the hard shell part of the case is more pink than purple (""mauve""?).  My wife really wanted a true pink, but this will have to do since it's the closet thing OtterBox offers.*I* wouldn't like this case because of how difficult it is to press the buttons (which I why I rated it 4 stars).  However, my wife is the one that has to use it and she says she doesn't have a problem with it, so...it's clearly a personal thing.I was deciding between the Samsung Galaxy S3 and Galaxy Note 2 phones for myself, and now that I have decided on the Note 2, I will be going with a Seidio Surface Case & Holster combo instead of this OtterBox case.",4.0,1354060800,"11 28, 2012",OtterBox Commuter Series Case for Samsung Galaxy S III - Retail Packaging - White,19.94,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/311nnIr8LuL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 873},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"
B0085JRQFU,A2PFECTM8ESBSF,crimsongator,"[4, 6]","I have had two smartphones and numerous different cases.  For this phone, the Samsung Galaxy SIII, I have tried two cases.  This is the best I've ever had - period.When I went to order this case, it was on back order for several weeks and my phone was scheduled to arrive in just a few days.  I was also looking at the Diztronic case:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0089F49P0/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00The reviews for the Distronic case were good, and it was also pretty cheap, so I decided to buy it so I would have some protection right away while I waited on the Otterbox to arrive.  The only real problem with the Distronic case is that it just doesn't provide much protection from drops.  I was concerned about really protecting my phone, so I decided to order the Otterbox 77-21392 Commuter Case too.I was a little apprehensive about the Otterbox because it's not as cheap and also because I have seen people with those huge cage-looking Otterbox cases for their iPhones and I didn't want something that big and bulky (and ugly, in my opinion).  The Galaxy SIII is a large phone due to its big screen, but it is otherwise very thin and I didn't wan't to ruin that.In the end, I decided to try my first Otterbox, and I am thrilled!  It just came today.  First, I have the white SIII phone, and this case looks great on it - very sharp looking.  The gray and white contrast is stylish.  Second, I finally feel like my phone is protected from drops.  Also, it clearly adds some bulk to the phone but not nearly as much as the other style Otterbox cases do and I am fine with the new size of the cased phone.  The phone feels safer and more substantial (in a good way) without being too bulky in my pocket.  Finally, the case form-fits VERY well, and the cut outs and the covers for buttons, etc. are perfect.  It adds some stiffness to the power button and volume rocker as all cases of this type would, but it is not too stiff to make it a nuisance.The case is absolutely perfect - I am thrilled with the look, feel, size, and functionality of this case.

B0085JRQFU,A2YM85TO0H2JET,D. Emerson,"[0, 0]","Otterbox is known for its quality protection, even if it tends to be at the upper range in terms of price. I was a bit wary of putting more money into a case, but after buying several lower-end cases that were always a bit off in one way or another, I finally decided to make the investment.Very glad that I did.Pros:1) Two-layer protection does protect against most everything. I've dropped my phone several times, on asphalt, concrete, and the kitchen floor (I have a four-year old who tends to knock everything out of my hands), and there is no problem at all. Case doesn't move, screen hasn't been cracked, scratched or otherwise hurt.2) The protection is great, and it maintains the slim feel of the phone. It slides in my pockets easily, without catching or being overly bulky. A lot of slimmer cases don't protect well, and the cases that do protect well tend to not be slim. Very nice compromise between the two.3) I like the colors. I got the dark purple silicone lower layer with the lighter lilac outer, and it's a nice color combination. Fun without being unprofessional or garish.Cons:1) The back is VERY slippery. Almost as slippery as the actual phone back itself, and I've found it becoming a bit hard to hold on to at times. It's not a deal-breaker for me, because that slippery aspect is what also makes it easier to get in and out of my pocket.2) The buttons are a bit stiff, like other reviewers have mentioned, but honestly, the more I've used them, the more malleable they've become. And to be honest, I can't count how may times I've handed my phone to someone to take a picture or look at something, and they've accidentally turned it off, or turned down the volume. The stiff buttons may be hard to press, but ultimately, that's not been a ""bad"" thing for me.The screen protector that came with the phone is meh. I don't consider it a pro or con overall. There are better quality ones out there, for sure, that actually cover the screen edge to edge, but it does the job.The cover itself is also not the easiest to get on, since the plastic is very stiff and doesn't go over the rubber easily. The tabs for the headphone jack and power cable also don't go through that easily when installing the case and get stuck beneath it, but overall, it's not that bad. A bit more effort and maneuvering, but honestly, once it's in place, it's very secure and firm. So the installation is meh, but the reward is pretty good.Overall, I love the case, and totally wouldn't trade it for any other.

B0085JRQFU,AKGRY8IQXX6AD,driveswift,"[0, 0]","Really liked the Commuter series better than the Defender because of its size - the Defender isn't pocket friendly for women but will fit in a suit pocket.The Commuter series has the snap on outer case with rubber underneath exposed on the corners so it absorbs shock in the places most likely to cause cracks when dropped. I gave my Commuter case to my sister after she cracked her screen and she loves it. No issues with camera or microphone holes, both are cut to fit pretty precisely. One caveat is that it is a little hard to push the buttons at first, but it gets softer once worn in and hasn't posed any problems. Also, since the back is hard plastic it can be fairly slippery, and can't be placed on a tilted surface without sliding, even on my lap on the train. That is the main advantage of the Defender case which I replaced it with.I got the Defender case for myself thinking it would be much better, but because the soft rubbery layer is on the outside it is prone to stretching. It is still a great case and I haven't broken my phone (though I've dropped it literally dozens of times - on rocks, on the train platform, on carpet, on bathroom tile) which is a pleasant change for me.The customer service is also great - when the outer case did stretch it was within the year warranty so I just uploaded a picture with my name and address pointing to the defect and Otterbox sent a new one. I presume they would do the same for the Commuter Series.

B0085JRQFU,AN81JUYW2SL24,Gearhead Mania,"[0, 0]","The Commuter is comprised of 2 pieces: A silicone rubber that envelopes the Samsung Galaxy S3, and a plastic outer shell that provides some additional protection. The 2 biggest problems I have are that the buttons are overly ""stiff"" and the plastic shell is too slippery.The Prefix has more tactile buttons (similar to the Defender) but the Prefix's outer shell is a harder rubber that is less grippy than the Defender but nowhere as slippery as the Commuter. Unfortunately, the Prefix has inconsistent build quality. One fit overly tight and another fit overly loose. I gave up on the Prefix shortly thereafter.I had been using my Defender for just about a year and loved it, except I cracked 4 holsters that were all replaced under warranty within that year. I wouldn't have an issue just having new holsters replaced under warranty, except each time they cracked was during some kind of important event or at the most inopportune time. Once was at a company bowling event. Another was when I was camping in the middle of nowhere, another time was at a shopping mall parking lot.The Commuter is noticeably thinner and lighter than the Defender. The plastic shell is slippery and hard, so it tends to slide around on surfaces and tends to knock around on a dashboard or cupholder. The silicone rubber flaps for the earphone and USB ports feel cheap and they are held in place by the plastic shell.The buttons feel stiff because Otterbox did not extend the rubber material underneath the buttons. Looking at the Prefix and Defender rubber buttons, they are thicker and contact the phone buttons sooner thus they are more tactile. The Commuter requires more force to push down because they were made too thin.Overall: 4/5 stars. It would be 5/5 stars if the plastic shell wasn't so slippery and if the buttons were made properly so they wouldn't feel so stiff.",4.0,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",OtterBox Commuter Series Case for Samsung Galaxy S III - Retail Packaging - White,19.94,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/311nnIr8LuL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 873},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B0085JRQFU,AI4H1QU8H214H,"J. Bellin ""analog_j""","[1, 1]","I was comparing the Incipio 2-piece case with the OtterBox Commuter case, both of similar design.  Frankly, the OtterBox fits the Samsung Galaxy S III more snugly, which is a good and bad thing.  It is very difficult to take off.  The Incipio slides on and off more easily, but I could see a possibility that in taking it out of a snug pocket, both of the pieces, which fit together, could come off.  I always put it in a jacket pocket, which fits loosely, so I don't anticipate the problem.Both cases use a polycarbonate exoskeleton over a silicone inner.  Both silicone inners create a lip on the front, so if you do drop the phone on the front, the lip will protect it.  The exoskeleton on the OtterBox is a slightly more rigid and thicker, so perhaps it might be a bit more protective.  Furthermore, the OtterBox has tabs which fit over the headphone and charge ports, making it more protective against the elements.The killer to the OtterBox deal for me, though, is the button material that is used over the volume rocker.  The volume rocker on the Galaxy, itself, is soft and quite easy to use -- almost too easily touch.  The material that goes over the rocker on the OtterBox is terribly stiff.  Both the salesperson in the Verizon store as well as me had to turn the phone on its side and really push down hard on the top or bottom of the OtterBox button in order to get the volume rocker switch to respond.  Neither of us had good luck using a one-handed approach to the phone in that regard.Contrast that, not only to the Incipio, but to OtterBox's own Defender case, which has a button which is MUCH more pliable, making it far easier to manipulate the volume rocker underneath.  If I needed a really a hearty, super-protective case (If my phone were to be in physically perilous situations a lot), I'd definitely consider the Defender.  But the Defender case adds considerable bulk - both weight-wise and size-wise.  If you think you bought an elegant phone with nicely curved lines, fogeddaboutit.Which brings me back to the Incipio.  Perhaps it doesn't cross the 't's and dot the 'i's the way the Commuter case does, but it otherwise gives the normal user a substantial amount of protection -- quite adequate really.  I have already dropped the phone twice in two weeks, including once on its face on my ceramic-tiled bathroom floor.

No problem sliding in and out of your pocket. Really I mean this is is nice! Except for one flaw and for me it's a big one.  The buttons or lack thereof. Pressing the power button is just plain out unpleasant. Way to hard to press. It feels as if there are no buttons and you're just pushing against the side of the case hard enough until it makes contact with the button on the phone. Some people will act as though it's not really a huge deal. And maybe it's not for them maybe they like hulking out on their phone. Or maybe they just don't want to admit it in order to justify their purchase. Instead of pressing the lock button you can press the home key to bring up the lock screen to avoid one of the thumb bending presses but unfortunately you have to press the lock button when you want to lock it and put it away. The big problem there is you really don't know when you have pressed the button which leads to the screen popping up a lot of times asking if you want to power the device down. I have heard the buttons soften over time. Hopefully that is true but it's going hard for me to use the case long enough to find out.

You need a soft shock-absorbing bumper, but by itself a gel skin picks up lint. Encasing the gel inside a smooth plastic case is the perfect solution, making it easy to slip into a pocket. You also get strong build quality and incredible customer service.But the Otterbox Commuter has problems: the flaps wear off, there's no kickstand, and similar cases are half the price.Unlike some cheap competitors, this case has protective flaps covering the USB and headphone ports, which adds some spill resistance, one would hope. But over time, those flaps wear out and rip off. Which leads me to the biggest positive: Otterbox has incredible customer service.I placed a warranty claim for torn port covers on the website. I got an email requesting three photos, which I sent. Two weeks later, a brand new case showed up at the door, completely free. Thud.The bad news: there's no kickstand.The Otterbox Commuter protects against drops, but it ""causes"" half of those drops, if you will. With the case installed, the edges of the phone are smooth. It needs a rubberized bumper around the edges, so I can prop it up on a table to watch video. As it is, if I try to prop up the phone to watch video, it very easily slides on its back. And off the table. I had to buy a wire book stand just for my phone. Of course, it's not like the phone would do any better without a case, but when there are so many cheap kickstand cases out there, the Otterbox Commuter just offers less functionality.Also, the stiff rubber makes the buttons very hard to press down. That's a nitpick, but it might matter to you.And the price. Normally this case goes for $25 and up, $35 list.

There is a very reasonable explanation for some saying their buttons are almost impossible to use while others say there is nothing at all to mention on that ""issue"".I first noticed on my 2 S3's that the Power Button on one is almost flush with the silver rim that goes around the middle of the case. The other protrudes about the same as the volume rocker. The ""almost flush"" unit power button is difficult to activate but works okay when the commuter is installed on it.The unit with the protruding power button is quite easy to use with the same Commuter case on it. Google ""Galaxy S3 loose power button"" and you'll see what I refer to. Also, next time you''re at your carrier, look at the display units and compare power button protrusions or lack there of.In short I am relatively sure both those that are having an impossible time activation some buttons are as correct as those saying they have no issue. Samsung has sold and has or is producing 10 million units and I suspect there is a different manufacturer for some of the same parts.This doesn't help those with an impossible to use Otterbox but does explain why some have that issue and others do not. Samsung isn't noted for their build quality (usually). Case makers can't offer varying degrees of contact points on the silicone case button so the only suggestion is get a different case.Solved my problem and again, PLEASE don't take my word for it.

It should also be noted that, unlike many phone covers, the charging and earphone ports on this case have plenty of space for bigger after-market chargers/headphones - a huge positive feature that you only appreciate after dealing with cases that don't.

So I purchased one here on Amazon (direct from Amazon).Previous reviews are spot on when they say there is a flaw.  First, Otterbox changed the rubber being used.  Its more like a car tire rubber than it used to be.  Next, the little nub on the underside of the skin (used to press the power button) is just too short.  Lastly, the power button has a very slight angle to it.  I confirmed this on multiple cases, they all have this slight angle which makes it even harder to hit the sweet spot to activate the device.I thought maybe I had a flawed case so I went to a local shop and checked out their otterboxes.  Same results.I spent days with the case off trying to wear in the rubber to no avail.

B0085JRQFU,A7CRBQLU69YLZ,"mrdoon ""mrdoon""","[1, 1]","Update: I've had the Otterbox Commuter Case for a while now and I just wanted to give a brief update.  As much as I like the Commuter case, the slipperiness prompted me to try out a couple of other casess - just in case I found something that served my needs better.  I purchased the Seidio Active Case and the Incipio Silicrylic Hard Shell case.  Both had decent reviews and were often compared (from the protection they provide) to the Otterbox.  I owned a Seidio Active case in the past and was excited about having the built-in kickstand but I just couldn't get over the powdery feel of the silicone shell or the amount of lint it picked up so I returned it.  I liked the Incipio case quite a bit - it felt good in my hands, looked good, and was much easier to hang onto than the Otterbox Commuter Case.  With all of this said, I don't feel that either of these cases can even come close to providing the same level of protection as the Otterbox.  I've decided to keep the Incipio case to use on those days when I want a little less bulk but the Otterbox remains my day to day case.When I purchased my GS3, I bought the slim little case/holster combo from Verizon.  It didn't add too much bulk and I liked the kickstand that's built into the case. (I never used the holster.)  Fast forward a few months and, while I was trying to put the phone in my shirt pocket, I missed and the phone dropped onto the sidewalk (screen side down) from a height of about 5 1/2 feet.  Not surprisingly, the end result was a shattered screen.  Fortunately, I was able to get a replacement and decided that I should get a case that provided a higher level of protection.  I ultimately decided on the OtterBox Commuter case.My first impressions are of a well-made, sturdy case.  It was reasonably easy to put on (I did have to wiggle the volume and power buttons around a bit) and definitely feels more substantial.  The cut-outs/buttons line up perfectly but, as other reviewers have said, the power button does require more pressure to push than it should.  My only significant complaint, and I don't know if this is a deal breaker, is that the hard plastic shell is incredibly slippery.  While this might make it easier to get in/out of your pocket, it also makes it more likely that you will accidentally drop your phone. (Good thing you have this great case!)  If it weren't for the slippery, outer shell, I'd have given this case 5 stars as it is intended for an extra level of protection and I think it will provide this.",4.0,1353542400,"11 22, 2012",OtterBox Commuter Series Case for Samsung Galaxy S III - Retail Packaging - White,19.94,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/311nnIr8LuL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 873},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

Win some, lose some, as usual.  To get it on, I have to put the soft, inside layer on, then fit the hard case over it.  This is fairly easy, but it sometimes does press the power and volume buttons in the process.  Taking the case off it quite easy, as the two parts come off together.  The only real issue that I deducted a star for was the ease of using the push buttons with case on, or rather lack thereof.  The power and volume buttons on the sides are quite difficult to press with the case on - a problem I have only experienced with Otterbox cases.

B0085JRQFU,A1P29UOCE9ZW76,RyanM,"[0, 0]","From my point of view, the case is great! The white on gray go hand in hand together. Haven't had a drop yet but the hard rubber feels like it can absorb a good impact, and the polycarbonate hard shell fits tightly around the rubber and allows for extended protection. The inside corners of the rubber (which are the corners sticking out of the shell) are kind of hollowed out and have two lines that actually hold the phone in place. My guess is that this offers better absorption for impact. The rubber doesn't catch lint or dirt from my pockets. Pretty easy to put in and pull out of my pocket. Not too bulky either.I wouldn't consider these next bits of info as bad or negative reviews, but as a heads up so you know what you're getting into.The polycarbonate is quite slippery and the backside doesn't stay put on a desk type of surface. Turning it upside down, the rubber lip grips the surface allowing it to stay put.I've actually put rubber tips on the the 4 corners of the backside so it doesn't slip anymore.The rubber tips also elevates it which is good because without the added on tips, placing the phone on its back completely covers the speaker. Sound is drowned pretty much. So with it being elevated by the rubber tips I added for surface grip, it also serves me to hear the audio quite well.Grip wise, I could see this slipping out of my hand at some point. Again, the polycarbonate shell is slippery for me as I don't have moist, clammy hands. Rubber inlays would have been nice on the left and right side of the shell, rather than just the power and volume buttons sticking out. Not a big deal overall as I use both my hands for my phone anyway.Buttons are easy to push for me. Yes, you definitely have to apply more pressure as opposed to the case not being on and pushing the button itself. But as for me, I can push the button with the case on, without hassle. I can even feel and hear the click.I realize that I may have more ""bad"" (remember just a heads up) than good to say but I think you should look past it if you can. For me, case or no case I'm always cautious with my phones so that may be why. As long as the case is reputable, sturdy, and covers the phone with good protection, I'm happy with it.I'm just giving you input on the ""bad"" for you future buyers but this case is rock solid for me. I'd buy this case again in a heartbeat it anything ever happened to it. Though if something did happen to the case abuse wise, then I'm pretty sure I'd have to get a new phone lol.",5.0,1372636800,"07 1, 2013",OtterBox Commuter Series Case for Samsung Galaxy S III - Retail Packaging - White,19.94,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/311nnIr8LuL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 873},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

The power button (& also the volume rocker), as with BOTH of my commuters is TILTED back ever so slightly (the surface of the button does not lie flush & flat with the  side of the case) so that you can press the button as the phone lies in your hand - this is intentional. When you get used to it, it is NOT a problem. Just push with the direction of the button. Also, when I put the hard case on, I slip the power button in it's place first, for proper alignment.The commuter offers protection without all the bulk of the defender. It feels very solid and comfortable in my hand (& I am a small woman @ 5'1""). The buttons being just below the outtermost edge adds to the usability of the phone while in the commuter.

First off, I love the design of this one for the Galaxy S3.  It looks great and as well designed.  I feel like I could drop the phone from the roof and it would still be okay.  As compared to the iPhone version I have noticed some improvements.  On the GS3 version there is a hard plastic clip type area where the belt clip attaches to the case.  This is a big improvement.  The iPhone model had the silicone in the same area, and after taking the phone out over time the silcone would break from the stress.  The case was still functional, but it looked bad.  The screen protector is clear and bright and doesn't cause any problems with functionality.  I like that it is integrated into the top of the case rather than attached to the screen itself.  The buttons are covered so they are a little harder to press, but it is not an issue what so ever.So why is it almost perfect?  When in the holster it rattles a little.  It is attached solidly in the holster, so I'm not worried about it falling out.  You can hear it rattle just a little.  I probably wouldn't even notice it in an environment with any kind of background sounds. But, knowing how the iPhone version was it's a little annoying.  I imagine this was the trade off with attaching it to the hard plastic clip versus the silicone area.  If that is the case then I understand.  I still might try and add a small piece of foam or something to the holster to hold the phone a little more snug.I would definitely recommend this case.  There are others out there, but I have complete confidence in the quality and level of protection this case gives me.",5.0,1345334400,"08 19, 2012",OtterBox Defender Series Case for Samsung Galaxy S III - Retail Packaging - Purple,39.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mRy%2BBpuEL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2013},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

Their screen protector still distorts a HD screen though and that is why this product will not receive 5 stars.

I will admit this case will protect your phone, but the complaints about the screen shield are all accurate. I removed the screen shield (& all the glue that's on the case after you remove the protector) & installed ""Tech Armor HD Clear Screen Protectors"". Those work well enough to prevent your screen from getting scratched up.The complaints about the rubber (silicone) outer skin getting loose are also accurate & mine is only a week old now. The complaints about the power & volume buttons are false. Maybe if you put the rubber outer shell on backwards, but the built in buttons on the outer skin work very well. In fact my Samsung Galaxy S3 is also a week old & before I put the Otter Box on it (during phone set up), the power button fell off. I reinstalled it myself & the Otter Box will keep it from falling out again.

I dropped the phone twice with the case on it and had no damage to the phone.  One of the drops was directly on the face, no problem.  Otterbox has made a great case here.  My chief complaint though is that it just made my phone a little too big.  The Galaxy S3 is big on its own and when in this case, made for some comic relief for friends wanting to know if they could ""Come to my place to watch the Superbowl"" on my phone.  For me the feel was just too big.  I like a thinner profile and a flatter one as well.  the Defender is kind of bulbous for lack of a better term.  It protects the phone very well but is too big for me.I eventually purchased a different case and now have the Otterbox in a drawer.",3.0,1357603200,"01 8, 2013",OtterBox Defender Series Case for Samsung Galaxy S III - Retail Packaging - Purple,39.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mRy%2BBpuEL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2013},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

I have dropped my phone on hard flooring and concrete probably about 5-8 times over the course of time from 3-6ft distances and in every instance this case has protected it properly. It holds the phone well and is sticky enough to not slip out of hand, but smooth enough to slide decently easy in and out of my pocket. That being said, the opening around the home button is a dirt collector. Also after about 6 months, the silicone shell started stretching out and not setting on the plastic casing like it should. It started at the bottom then worked its way around to where now it doesn't stay on the plastic casing at all. the only thing that holds it is the small plug that keeps the headphone port covered when not in use. Without that, the silicone just falls off. The silicone is also starting to just peel apart as well. all the small skinny sections are coming off. it's also a matter of time before the headphone port cover falls off the silicone because its getting a crack in it where it bends. My biggest gripe however are the small plastic clips that hold the front casing to the back are all broken except one. i have multiple batteries for my phone and the case requires disassembly to change them. Even being careful and easy, the little clips are so frail that they broke anyway. They broke one by one until all but the top one remains in good shape. The last time my phone dropped the case just blows into pieces hurtling my phone out in the open. Thankfully, it didn't bust or scratch the phone. Because of this I purchased a replacement case (Ballistic Hardcore, figured I'd give that one a shot).

It fits perfectly, is easy to install and remove, and it makes that thin slippery S3 easy to hold on to. I can operate the phone with one hand with the otterbox on it, where before when the phone was naked, I'd hold it in 2 hands out of fear of my million dollar phone launching out of my fingers and kissing the floor. It hasn't gotten in the way of any of the soft keys or anything for that matter. It feels very solid to hold, and it slips in and out of my pockets without problem. The case is grippy but not sticky. I leave it on my leather seats in the car and no longer have to worry about it sliding off in a corner. All in all I love this case and it was just what I needed. If I had to find something about it that bothers me, i would have to say the screen protector. The inside of it is not coated, so it's easily marred or scratched if not careful. The outside isn't as buttery smooth as just a normal stick on screen protector, but I think it's wearing in a little and getting smoother. The plastic screen protector is extra protection so I will happily deal with the tiny gripes I have about it.This is a solid, comfortable case. Having it on my phone has added to my enjoyment of the S3, and gives me the piece of mind that if I do drop the phone, chances are it won't be a problem. The thirty three bucks I paid for it is better than retail at fifty or more, but I have to say as much as I like the case, I'd have felt better paying maybe twenty five bucks for it.

B0085JRQGE,A189OEG9EBUJ1Q,"T. Hamill ""Electronics Fiend""","[0, 0]","I've gone through many cases in my lifetime with various models of phones but I've never owned an OtterBox case for any phone.  I recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy S3 and bought a decent shell holster case for it.  It's not as thick, durable or protective as the OtterBox is and that shown through as the holster clip broke on me after about a month of use.  In comes the OtterBox Defender phone case.  I wanted something that had a durable holster (check), would protect my phone because I do have a tendency to drop it from time to time (check), did not interfere with the functionality of the phone (check) and didn't make my phone look too gaudy (semi-check).  Now if you're wondering, this does add a CONSIDERABLE amount of bulk to your phone.  If you're looking for a case to compliment the sleekness of your Galaxy S3...you should probably look somewhere else.  If you are, however, looking for something to protect the heck out of your phone like I was...this is most definitely the case for you.  Everything about this case screams protection.  I'm still trying to get used to the added bulk and the feeling of this beast sitting on my belt during everyday activities so I can't really speak as to how comfortable it is quite yet.  I can say though that I'm not the least bit worried about anything happening to my phone while using this case and I guess that probably says a lot depending on what you're looking for.  One last thing, the built-in screen protector..many have complained about it taking away from the beauty of the screen or whatever, I've read online where people just pop it out and use the protector they already and I'd have to agree with this method if indeed I do decide to keep this case.  It's not even about the way the screen looks to me with it on, personally it looks fine to me.  The screen is still responsive enough to do anything I'd want to do on my phone and I even still have my regular screen protector on my actual screen but the provided built-in screen just feels too plasticy to me...which isn't a big deal just doesn't appeal to me.  All in all, I'd say this is a fairly good case and I'll have to give myself some time to adjust to it but I would definitely recommend it if you're used to OtterBox and have a good idea of what to expect upon receiving products from them.",4.0,1354665600,"12 5, 2012",OtterBox Defender Series Case for Samsung Galaxy S III - Retail Packaging - Purple,39.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mRy%2BBpuEL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2013},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"
B0085JRQGE,AGR1V15L6FLMA,The Goat,"[0, 0]","I have one of these for my S2 Skyrocket and it works very well. At one point my clip broke and OtterBox sent me two replacement holsters for free without question. For that they are top notch so far in my book. The only fault that I found, but from their perspective I can understand is their screen protector. Since it is not adhered to screen and has a small air gap, dust and debris find their way in. At first I was annoyed and then I did the best thing I could have--- I removed the OtterBox screen protector. Since I already have a direct applique screen protector that has already sacrificed itself twice for me and saved the screen, the dirt was annoying so I simply popped it out. Now it is the perfect case for me and after having it for nearly a year I still like it as much as when I got it.Other than that, the only other drawback that I have been able to notice is when I use my Square credit card reader. Since it is a protective case and has some heft to it--- the headphone jack that the Square uses does not want to plug in all of the way. In this case, I do not blame OtterBox as they made a great case that works, but rather Square should have given it another 2-3mm of reach and all would have been perfect. Without the case, my Square reader fits just fine, but otherwise it is in the way. I am waiting to try a short extension so that I can plug the card reader into it and then use it.

The colors are striking and there are some good style choices.All the holes are exactly right and the covers for the headphone jack and micro usb are excellent.  I have 2 of these already in other colors--  One is purple and the other is aqua blue (blue-green, really).  The aqua color is probably the nicest, most subtle style.I ordered this ""atomic"" (or ""punked"" on the otterbox site) style thinking it would be a nice, striking blue against the lime green, but what I got was closer to dark gray or even just a shade or 2 lighter than black.  It was pretty disappointing.My only other complaint is that the specific case I received has some minor imperfections, like the outer shell not quite reaching all the way up to the inner shell protrusion around the camera lens, but it's very slight, and I doubt anyone beside me would actually spot it.The case doesn't add much weight, but it does add some much needed heft, so it feels a little more ""solid"" and safe in your hand.  This outer shell isn't quite as tacky as past defender cases, so it isn't really a lint magnet or anything, and it doesn't bulk it up as much as most other cases.

The first time I started using the Defender's when I switched to an Android phone I began calling it ""the Tank"".  It doubles the size of the device it's going on.  I use this case strictly for when I am working and offers the needed protection in my profession.  I use the case with the belt clip which is sturdy and just as protective as the case itself.  I had the Droid RAZR Maxx prior to the GS3.  A big difference I've noticed with this case is the outer rubber material which isn't as nearly as grippy as the that of the RAZR's.  I view this as a big plus since it isn't a lint magnet and it is much easier to slide in and out of pockets.  I'm not sure if the black on black version of this case is of the same material.  I've dropped, kicked and landed on this case more than a number of times and my phones have always remained in tact.  Otterbox's warranty has always treated me right as well.  Whenever I had experienced a failure of their case, whether it was my fault or a defect, the issue was always corrected quickly!  The only reason I dock the product a star is due to the non-removable screen protector.  Once it gets scuffed up, the only course of action is to tear it off the frame.

I found myself pressing so hard on the buttons with this case on that my fingers would cramp.

It only took about 3 days to arrive with the free shipping so that was pretty fast. When I first got it the first thing I did was pop out the screen protector and put an SGP anti glare one on and it was pretty much perfect. The ports are easy to access even if you don't have big fingernails. The buttons are responsive which is a plus. It has good drop protection which is why most people are looking to buy this. The apple is cut out so people know that you have an iPhone and it may bother you but personally it doesn't bother me. The camera cut out is big and it won't cause any problems with the flash. This color would look better on a white phone because it pretty much matches the iPhone 5's color.

When I received it(very fast by the way), I was equally impressed by the actual product in my hands.  I'm not too worried about it not being waterproof(non-submersible) as I am very careful with all the cellphones I've ever owned anyway.  But, I'm sure it will protect the phone in the rain as long as you don't let it get soaked.  As far as impact protection, this case will definitely provide enough protection as long as you don't intentionally slam it into the pavement.  The holster is really handy for clipping it to your vehicle's sun visor or fastening to your belt or back pack strap.  One of my favorite features is the built in screen protector - it really doesn't interfere with the touch sensitivity of the phone.  I've purchased other OtterBox products and have never been disappointed.

I ordered it on Thursday and it came the following Monday. If you own an I phone 5 then protect your investment with 1 of these. The belt clip has changed since the iPhone 4 but it is an improvement. Those who say it is not the same are wrong. I compared mine to the 1 my son bought for 50 bucks at Verizon and they are identical. It is the same box, the same quality, and identical to in every way to the 1 he paid 30 bucks more for. If you can't wait 4 days then go ahead and waste your money. Needless to say I had an Otterbox on my iPhone 4 and when I traded it in Verizon they gave me the maximum allowance because it was protected so well that it looks like new. I don't know who is writing that these are not genuine products because they are. Buy 1 and you will be glad you did. As far as I know these are the best protection for an iPhone 5 that is available at this time. Fred Tafter I had the OtterBox for several months I managed to scratch up the cover to where I needed a new protection screen. I called OtterBox to purchase one and they informed me that they were guaranteed for life. I told them it was not a product problem but something caused by me and I just wanted to buy a new screen and they would not hear of it, all they asked for was a picture of the damaged one be posted on their warranties website and they immediately sent me a brand new OtterBox.

B0090YGJ4I,A3Q2HYYMLJ9P10,A Prime Reviewer,"[0, 0]","I thought this case would be a 'can't miss' quality product.Otterbox has apparently developed a reputation for producing a quality product which provides the ultimate in protection. While I have no doubt that this case offers as much protection as any product at this price point, it fails in three very important criteria.1. Esthetics.I purchased the plain black case, which looks reasonably nice in the photos in the item description. Unfortunately, the actual case itself is just plain ugly. Forget about ever seeing the iphone 5's sleek lines. Those are replaced and covered by an enormous case defined by random, large bulbous rubber knobs which serve no purpose whatsoever aside from making the case look hideous.2. FunctionalityThe size of the case and the amount of material used are completely excessive for the case's intended use: protecting the phone in normal, everyday use. As a result, the phone's functionality is severely compromised. First, typing is absolutely laborious. Instead if being able to lay your hands flat, or allowing the outside of your hand to tilt downward a bit as one types, both hands (and therefore one's arms and shoulders) are all forced to tilt unnaturally in an upward direction. This is because the lip of the case is so huge, you have to raise the outside of your hands upwards to clear the case's raised edges.Also, the screen protector, as others have noted, doesn't quite touch the screen, like standard protectors which adhere to the screen. The tolerances are so poor for this item that you must press down on the screen protector to actually use the screen itself. This obviously creates lag and slop with any motion. Furthermore, screen brightness is compromised as a result of the screen protector. Sure, you could pop the protector out, but you should be able to use the product as is; it's unfortunate that an important feature of the case has to be removed in order to use the screen with any reasonable degree of sensitivity and accuracy.Third, the port cover is a simple rubber plug which presses upward against your power cable whenever it's plugged into the phone. A hinge would have added a moving part and hence increased the risk of breakage, but with a simple flap, there is a chance of the port being loosened over time as the port cover presses upward against the cable.I could go on and on but these are the most serious functional deficiencies I've been able to note so far.BulkEven when you're not using the phone, the case makes it's presence known. Your phone will be quite heavy with this case when you stow it in a pocket. The case is actually too thick to put into a jeans pocket comfortably if you wear slim jeans, and of course it's enormous size is impractical regardless whenever you sit unless you happen to be wearing oversized, mc hammer style pants. I've been keeping the phone with case in a coat pocket. The coat sags unceremoniously on the side where the phone is stored.One note on build quality: the secondary, outer portion of the case is made of a hard rubber compound. Ugly, but effective in protecting the phone from drops. I am less than pleased however, with the choice of hard plastic for the inner case which cocoons the phone itself. The inside of the case should have been rubberized, or covered with felt to protect the phone's casing. Also there are lots of sharp edges everywhere on the outside of this case. Very unsightly. Not what I expected from a major brand.ConclusionYes, this case offers excellent protection. Unfortunately, you can't enjoy using the phone itself as it was meant to be used as a result of the excessive bulk, size and design of the case. The choice of materials, clunky build quality, and very poor esthetics are major demerits.The iphone has been around for a while, so I am really surprised that a well known and respected brand like otterbox can make such stupid decisions in their design and still sell so many cases.Let's face it, there's no point in buying a case if it is both ugly to look at as well as serving as a major hindrance to the easy/ease of use of the phone itself.I can't wait for my new case to arrive. I feel like I made a mistake by purchasing the otterbox.

B0090YGJ4I,A30EUHEZEC6QOZ,Arelunde,"[0, 0]","I've purchased no less than five Otterbox Defenders for my iPhone 5 - reason: to get a color selection that can can be mix/match customized. Even though this review is under the heading ""black case"", it's not limited to that version.One of my five must have been a super-early version of the OD because the outer skin was a stretchy silicone - loose fit, tacky and a lint collector. I didn't like it at all.  Also, this earlier version allowed the iPhone to slip slightly within the case - the non-skid rubber inside the hard plastic back was slick and not as thick as the later versions. I pushed out the screen protector to use my own, which may have allowed the slipping but I'm not sure on that. I got rid of this one.Each of the remaining four have been outstanding in every way. The all have the newer rubber-base, sleek outer cover with just enough texture to provide a solid grip. Honestly, I haven't had most of the issues detailed in many of the reviews here. I have used it with the built-in screen protector (with and without another screen protector underneath) and without the built-in screen protector (just the one I had on before I got the OD). I never had the rainbow effect, but I DID make really sure the iPhone screen AND the inside of the OD screen protector were perfectly clean.I prefer my own screen protector because the built-in one (especially when it's over another screen protector) doesn't have the quick response. It works, but not as responsive as my own. Also, I did pick up a slight separation between the built-in protector and the screen when there was not another protector underneath. It was very minor, and I likely wouldn't have noticed it if I hadn't read others' comments on this. It wasn't a deal breaker.The fit has been snug and consistent. The Apple logo is centered in the little window on the back. The edges around the screen don't get in the way of using the screen at all, nor does the raised area over the home button.  A bonus I've found is the power port cover eliminates the tendency of my iPhone 5 mic to have feedback or echoes for some callers. That power port cover does NOT interfere with how I sound to callers - they can't tell if they are on speaker or if I'm holding it. I do keep the mic relatively nearby when on speaker, though.I've read in the forums that there are a lot of knock-off ODs out there and I'm wondering if some of the issues mentioned in these reviews might stem from these versions. I understand it's really hard to tell the difference without a close scrutiny. I strongly recommend the (real) Otterbox Defender for iPhone 5. It certainly beefs up the iPhone 5 by adding significant weight and size, but the overall result is positive. I actually like the additional bulk. For some reason, it just feels good to hold, not to mention the main reason for using it - the high level of protection.",5.0,1359158400,"01 26, 2013",OtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5 (Discontinued by Manufacturer) ( Not for iPhone 5C) Retail Packaging Bolt - Grey,24.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31VQqq63lWL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2387},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

This is markedly improved from the Defender series for the iPhone 4. Possibly because the iPhone 5 is thinner it allowed Otterbox more options for design. But I like that the rim around the screen is raised on all sides with a nice slope on the top and bottom. The front and back camera holes are excellent, flash photos come out great. The speaker cutouts are great and you get very secure protection for the volume mute slide and the power connector.I also like the Defender series because it is very 'gripy' and makes the phone pleasing to hold. If you are OK with the added size, especially in width and extra weight, this is an excellent choice. Everyone has different wants and desires.

B0090YGJ4I,A2DONKOXI3JU6A,Ben Moore,"[0, 0]","Long time Otterbox Defender user here for my tablets and phones.  Are they bulky, yep.  Are they sturdy, heck yes.  Will they protect your device if it falls down a flight of stairs or onto concrete etc... ABSOLUTELY!Obviously, one should expect trade off's when you are trying to protect a sleek and minimalist design like an iPhone.  When you wrap it up in armor, it's going to have to cover all that up to ensure it survives whatever it is that you and your life are going to throw at it.  I purchased this for my wife who just upgraded to an iPhone 5s.  She is on the go all the time and we have two children who love to help themselves to our devices when they can.  I know that wrapping this up in the cocoon that is an Otterbox Defender it's going to survive a long long time.Now, this is the iPhone 5 version of the Otterbox Defender and I purchased this model on purpose.  Personally, I don't care to use TouchID and having the case wrap up over the bottom of the phone with a silicone cover over the button is a much better value than a gimmicky fingerprint reader in my opinion.  For phone security, I will continue to use a secure (more than 4 digit) pin.  If TouchID is a feature that you can't live without, do NOT buy this case.  You will be disappointed.The cut-out in the back for the camera and flash is large enough to accommodate the new double flash which is an upgrade over the iPhone 5.  The front cut-out, volume + -, mute, lightning connector, and audio out jack are all carried over from the 5, so they line up just fine as well.The overall fit of the Defender is perfect.  The phone sits snugly in the stiff plastic core which snaps together prior to the application of the rubberized sleeve which adds impact protection around the back and sides of your device.  Having come from Samsung Galaxy S3's, I like the overall fit of the iPhone case vs what I experienced with my Galaxy (also in a Defender case).  Speaking of perfection, dealing with Otterbox, on the very few times I have needed to, has always been a pleasure.  Customer service is attentive and seems to be US based.  I had issues with the silicone stretching and no longer maintaining a strong fit.  A phone call, 2 pictures and an email reply were all that it took to get a replacement sent out (at their expense) to get me back on track.  This kind of service (and fantastic real world protection) are what keep me coming back to Otterbox to protect my devices whenever I upgrade.The biggest detraction from this (and any Defender case) in my opinion is the built in screen protection.  I have a problem with any screen protection mounted to a case because it's simply impossible to keep dust, lint, pocket fuzz, moisture, etc from getting between the phone and the protector.  Once you get anything in there you have to take the whole thing apart, clean everything thoroughly and then put it back together.  Depending on how you carry your phone, this could be required multiple times a day and who has time for that??  The solution, I find, is to use a third party screen protection (Zagg or other) which is applied directly to the phone (or tablet) itself.  Once you have this protection in place, the built in screen protection isn't needed and can be removed.  Once this is completed, put the phone in the case and button it all up and viola'!  Complete phone protection and a screen that won't fall prey to dust and debris build up!**Summary**I've used Otterbox Defender's on Blackberry, Android, iPhone and iPad's and have never been disappointed with the product or the service that I have received.  This is why I continue to seek them out for myself and my family when new devices come into our household.  If I am going to buy it in the first place, I want to make sure it stands a good chance of SURVIVING an active household with KIDS. :)**UPDATE 12/26/13**I ordered as second Defender for my 5s to have as a backup.  My current primary case is the uNu DX which is a fantastic, battery backup case which provides a complete charge via the enclosed battery pack.  There have been some users that report issues with those cases after a few months.  As a power user who depends on my phone, should something happen to my current case, I need a backup to transition to while waiting for an RMA replacement.  I know the Otterbox defender won't let me down, and if you shop the sales here at Amazon you can grab one for a song.",5.0,1386028800,"12 3, 2013",OtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5 (Discontinued by Manufacturer) ( Not for iPhone 5C) Retail Packaging Bolt - Grey,24.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31VQqq63lWL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2387},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

I have 2 young kids and am an avid camper so protecting my devices from sticky hands, dust and drops is more important than sleek looks.PROS-  The case offers good impact protection.-  The case seemed big at first but now seems normal after a week.-  Fits in the back pocket of my jeans - real jeans, not skinny ones.-  The case protrudes enough on front and back that it should protect your device if liquid were to be spilled around it.CONS- The screen protector kept sticking to the screen producing what others are calling a watermark effect.  It is horribly annoying.  I followed online suggestions to use Windex and newspaper to clean the phone and screen protector and it fixed the issue.  That said, the news paper/Windex did scratch-up the screen protector.  Lame.- I stuck the phone into the included belt clip and it started to tear the rubber casing on the phone.  Won't be using the clip anymore!- If you have really short finger nails than you may have trouble opening the flap to the phone silence button on the side. I have to use my keys.  The covers on the bottom are easier to flip open because of the speaker/mic holes.I think Otterbox could have done a better job on this case.  It's not bad if you absolutely need the protection but I recommend getting something else if you don't need your case to be bomb proof.I hope this review is useful to you.UPDATE 1/28/2013Otterbox is so nice to deal with.  They have sent me a new case and claim that they have resolved the ""watermark issue"" by applying a new material to their screen protector.  They also said that if you have an existing case to NOT use Windex or newspaper to get rid of the watermarking and to use baby powder instead.  They said to gently apply to screen of iPhone and to inside of screen protector - gently wipe away so you can't see anymore and then install the case. Also, the case really is very resistant to drops.UPDATE 1/31/2013Otterbox sent me a new case and the design has been slightly modified to prevent the water mark issue.  The good news is that there is no more water marks.  The bad news is that the built in screen protector no longer lays on the iPhone so there is a small air pocket between them.  It feels horrible.  Each time you press down on the screen you connect with the protector and then your finger must continue pushing down until it makes contact with the iPhone.

B0090YGJ4I,AS4CM6IQHKUC6,Cougar Alex,"[0, 0]","I just recently got the iPhone 5 back in November and was without a case for about a month. I had a flimsy one but I knew I needed something more protective. I was interested in the Otterbox because I previously had one for my iPhone 4 and absolutely loved it because it offered so much protection. For Christmas I was fortunate enough to get one as a present from my family and I immediately put it on my phone. Although there are other protective phone cases, I wanted the Otterbox because of my past experience with the product and reviews from friends and family. I'm more than happy with my experience so far.There are a couple different Otterbox designs you can choose from. There is the Commuter series and the Defender series all that have many color schemes to choose from. All I've ever bought is the Defender series as this one offers the most protection. I have the pink and white one.  This case has two different layers that offer the best protection. The first layer you put on the phone is the hard shell. The hard shell completely covers the majority of the phone except the buttons and ports. There is a built in screen protector which is nice. The next layer is a silicone stretchy layer. This layer goes over the hard shell and covers all buttons and ports.The buttons are easy to push with the silicone covering.When the time comes to charge the phone it is fairly easy to unplug the lightning port for the charging cable. The same goes for the headphone jack. There is also a covering for the volume jack. As I have said before, all these silicone coverings are very easy to remove. I haven't had any problems with the case so far. The phone is very thin so putting on the Otterbox definitely makes it bulkier, but I've been able to get use to it. I'm also very clumsy and will drop my phone on accident once in a while. There has been no harm done to my phone. I can't even imagine what I would do if I didn't have the Otterbox.If you are any kind of business worker and like to have your phone by your side the case comes with a holster that attaches to your pants or wherever. The phone easily connects and is easily removed. With the iPhone 4, I was easily able to put the phone in my back pocket with the Otterbox on, but I've realized with the iPhone 5, it's much harder to fit in my pockets so I use my purse when needed.The Otterbox is pricier than most other phone cases ranging from fifty to sixty dollars, but the money is worth the quality of the cases. They last for a long time and as I've mentioned before, they seriously protect the phone from most damage you could do. I'm very clumsy with my belongings and just having the Otterbox on my phone has made a huge difference. I never once had a scratch or crack on my iPhone 4 and have yet to scratch or crack my iPhone 5. I can't even imagine the damage I would have on my phone if I didn't have the Otterbox. Overall, the Otterbox Defender series for the iPhone 5 is a great case if you're looking for the best value and protection for your phone.",4.0,1359936000,"02 4, 2013",OtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5 (Discontinued by Manufacturer) ( Not for iPhone 5C) Retail Packaging Bolt - Grey,24.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31VQqq63lWL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2387},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

I spent HOURS trying tot get rid of it. it was not dust or fingerprints. i do not know what the issue was. but it was terrible to look at. I emailed them, and they forwarded me to a video, made by some random youtube user, that suggested I put baby powder in between the case and the phone! i did this, and i just had a crappy case, with baby powder in it! Why would they sell such a product, knowing most people would need to buy baby powder to make the watermark go away. The watermark did go away, but the case was filled with baby powder!  Who would buy an expensive case, just to put baby powder in it! Also, their second suggestion was to rip out the screen protector, and buy an adhesive one! If the feature is advertised to work, and it does not, then that feature (the built in screen protector) should not be sold in the case yet.

I was extremely disappointed with this case, the hard plastic of the commuter case began to crack and break off in pieces after only a month of use (see pictures and review on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/OtterBox-Commuter-Series-iPhone-Frustration-Free/dp/B00974L0F4/ref=cm_cmu_pg__header). Our kids tend to be a quite hard on our phones, especially the toddler! But all the previous cases from otterbox have held up so well, I have an old iPhone 4S commuter case that is over 2 years old and still in great shape. So I decided to upgrade to the Defender case to see if it would perform properly. I also waited almost 6 months to write this review. The Defender case has held up as expected, and is still working great. After multiple drops, and harsh treatment the case still looks like new, and no damage to phone or screen.

B0090YGJ4I,A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8,"Diana De Avila ""MS Gkygrl""","[8, 11]","I have been using the Otterbox Defender for all of my Apple devices (including iPad) since the iPhone 3G.  The Otterbox Defender for iPhone 5 is, in my opinion, the best yet.  Every iteration brings slightly better engineering and understanding of the product design and the materials needed, and cutouts for port accessibility.There is a distinguishable difference between the Defender for iPhone 4/4S and that of the 5 and this can be easily seen in some design changes:1) The outer silicone is slightly stiffer but seems more durable than other iterations.  It slides on the plastic grooves and port openings easily like a glove and the port openings and closing flaps stay put and snug the device well.  Kudos.2) The plastic inner cover is much easier to snap on and off - it uses 6 snaps with well-marked arrows.  It takes a lot less struggle to get the phone in and out of the case for cleaning or what not.3) The screen cover fits perfectly.  With all Otterbox products you DO sacrifice some display quality (in this case Retina) for the option of protection.  If you need Otterbox Defender protection, this is just one of the cost / benefits.  I experience the same issue with my iPad Defender and realize this is just a byproduct of the screen protection.  There are no screen bubbles to report ... perfect fit as with the iPhone 4 Defender.  There are also openings in the front to allow for the Facetime and regular camera to be exposed without the covers that were on the front of the prior versions of Defender.  There may be mixed reviews on this one (pros and cons of dust build-up) but I like it and will just ensure I clean my phone more.  The dust build-up in the smaller crevices on prior versions of the Defender were not that welcome and were difficult to clean.4) The updated holster design is welcomed!  It is much less bulky but somehow adds more durability to the clip.  The turning mechanism on the clip is much smoother and seems more durable.  I knew several colleagues who dealt with broken clips and I think that this will be less a problem with the iPhone 5 Otterbox Defender holster clip.  The design of the holster is also more open on the sides and this makes handling a bit easier while providing less bulk.One of the main things that I was concerned about with was the smoother outer silicone cover was the slippery-factor and the fingerprint-factor.  Surprisingly, I have not dropped the phone once and fingerprints or smudges are a lot less impervious than I expected.I will certainly continue to put the Otterbox Defender for iPhone 5 through it's paces as I usually do.  I think the material and design changes make for a great product.Nice product!",5.0,1348963200,"09 30, 2012",OtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5 (Discontinued by Manufacturer) ( Not for iPhone 5C) Retail Packaging Bolt - Grey,24.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31VQqq63lWL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2387},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

Then I got a 4S and had an Otterbox Defender on it. I was used to it, and it kept the iPhone mint until time to sell it.Fast forward to this week, when I got this one for my new iPhone 5, and I must say they have made a much better quality case than before. It's a much snugger fit than before, and is actually a bit difficult to open the case. This does mean slightly better protection... or at least it would, were there not such a huge opening for the camera/flash combo, as well as the iSight camera and speaker. This seems to be a big deal for many, but not so much for me. I always had an issue cleaning dust and lint out of those openings on my old case, and now that's a thing of the past. My first Otterbox also seemed to make the feature where the screen deactivates when held up to your ear not work, no problems at all with this one, and no noticeable drop in signal quality either.The texture of this case does not feel as ""rubberized"" as the silicon case on the previous model. At first I wasn't sure I liked this, due to the non-slip factor of it, but I've come to enjoy it. The flaps the cover the charging port and microphone feel much sturdier than before, and I don't have to worry about them coming open accidentally.As always, a great case, from a great company. A bit overpriced, but hey, Applecare protection costs you what this case does, and if you have to use it, another $50 on top of that. Buy one of these, and just don't worry about it.

B0090YGJ4I,AR9I9VV1UM0AX,FAR,"[0, 0]","I have been using Otterbox products since the iPhone 3 and my experience has been generally good! I remember the original Defender product for the 3 (Yes, I am that old!). It was bulky, heavy, and somewhat of a nuisance but it protected and it was made for teens and adults alike! Not only does Otterbox make a quality, tried, and tested product, they are a fun company, and stand behind their products. After a couple of drops here and there, the cases may crack but your phone will be fully functional! Otterbox will replace the item under their limited lifetime warranty without hesitation!Back to the Defender...The Defender for iPhone 5 is different, for starters the silicone wrap feels thicker. Secondly, the case is less bulky yet offers the same level of protection. It is not going to be super thin and may not look shexy but it will protect your phone! It was easy to configure and the built-in screen protector did not have air bubbles or watermarks like the original Defender cases. Finally, it comes with a belt holster which adds I believe another dimension of protection if used. You can opt not to use the belt holster for less bulk. Without getting into too much detail, the ports are protected from dust/damage by tabs on the silicone wrap. This is a plus, esp because I have been the dock connector on phones get damaged far too easily. It is a solid feeling case and the color choices are splendid! When you have a phone like the 5, you want piece (peace) of mind that your phone will remain fully functional after traumatic impact. Someday phones will have airbags or perhaps they will be thin as air?...in any case!!Cases are based on personal preference. I find for the iPhone 4/4S the Otterbox Commuter is also an excellent choice. There are thousands of choices, it is mind boggling.

B0090YGJ4I,A2W0GY64CJSV5D,FreeSpirit,"[707, 768]","I got my iPhone 5 today (through carrier sources) though it's yet to be activated and the first thing I did naturally was put the Otterbox Defender case on it. I had the Defender for my 3GS and it protected my phone all these years. Didn't have the iPhone 4/4S so I can't compare it to that. Quick impressions so far:PROTECTION - Protection wise, the iPhone 5 Defender is at par with the 3GS.  Industrial grade protection with complete coverage. Same concept and overall design, though the silicone feels slightly thicker and more solid in the 5. The silicone has a matte finish compared to the smooth finish in the 3GS, which hopefully should help avoid dust and lint - this was the only drawback with the 3GS case, it needed cleaning frequently.BUTTONS/PORTS - Power and volume buttons are covered with silicone shaped like the buttons themselves. No problem pressing either of these buttons with the silicone. The headphone jack, charging port, and silent button have silicone plugs that can be pulled out to expose the jacks. (TIP - to open the plugs, insert nail and push the top silicone part higher to get behind the plug to pull it out. Hope this makes sense. The headphone plug is tiny and it can take some time getting used to opening it). The charging port plug, when opened, keeps snapping back into the case, which means it has to be held open with one hand to insert the charger. Insignificant issue, and I'm hoping that with use, this piece will loosen up a bit so that it stays open if needed. Opening at the back for the Apple logo is covered with a transparent plastic film. The front camera/speaker, the back camera/flash, and the two speakers at the bottom are left open and are the only exposed parts of the phone.SCREEN COVERAGE - Clear plastic film on the screen integrated into the case, the touchscreen experience is as good with the film as it is without the case. The transparent film creates a tiny layer of air or moisture between itself and the screen, which can create watermarks on the screen. This was an issue with the 3GS as well. (TIP - I had read several forums for my 3GS that recommended applying baby powder before installing this case, but I personally didn't find that to be a lasting solution. Applying an Anti-Glare film to the phone's screen before installing the case was the best solution. I am still waiting for my Anti-Glare film to come in, but I installed a spare I had for my 3GS just to see if that solved the issue with the 5, and it did).HOLSTER - The silicone is kept intact with two plastic tabs on the side. This really helps keep the silicone in shape and prevents it from stretching or loosening over time. These tabs also work as the locking mechanism for the holster. The case can be inserted facing in or out in the holster, a fine improvement by Otterbox. Most such holsters I have seen only allow face-in orientation (3GS allowed only face-in which I found annoying when going for a run). This holster has a fully rotating belt clip so that it can be attached vertically or horizontally on the belt. No chance of the case falling out, nice secure fit. The holster is much better and ergonomically designed than the 3GS version. It is easier to access the phone with this design.Here are a few details that I would have liked to see improved/addressed:- Front and back camera openings - the two openings are huge! The front camera/speaker/light sensor opening is one big opening. For the 3GS version (3GS only has speaker on the front, no camera) and from what I have seen for the 4S, the cases had a precision opening which provided better overall coverage. For the back, the opening is approximately 30-40% bigger than it should be for the camera and flash. It would have been nice to have more precise openings on both places for even better protection.- Headphone jack plug - this perhaps has more to do with the placement of the headphone jack itself, but the case opening is really small and it's not very smooth to open the silicone plug. For the 3GS, the silicone plug went around the headphone jack to the back, which made opening it a breeze. They could have used the same design for the 5 as well. With the current design, it takes time opening the headphone plug. It's entirely possible it is just something that takes getting used to, or that the silicone will loosen over time making it easier to open.- The iPhone 5 is a super sleek, light, and slick looking device. Putting the Defender case makes it bulky (more than doubles the thickness). Now this is a pro in that it offers super-protection which I cannot live without. The downside is that it takes away the aesthetic beauty of the iPhone.I bought this in black when that was the only color available. Now it seems there are a lot more choices. Wish I had waited for the Glacier (just a personal preference)!Other than these minor issues, I am overall very happy with this case and I hope to use it for several years to come, just I did with my 3GS Defender. Yes, it's slightly expensive, but it's also peace of mind.UPDATE 10-12-12The watermark issue seems to be persistent with this case and nothing seems to permanently help in this regard. The anti-glare film bridges the gap somewhat but only for a few days. The screen in the case lifts right back up after a few days and creates the watermark issue all over again making it difficult to use the screen. I am sending this back to get a different case. Yes, I want to protect my iPhone which is why I was willing to put up with the bulk of this case, but I can't give up functionality.",3.0,1348099200,"09 20, 2012",OtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5 (Discontinued by Manufacturer) ( Not for iPhone 5C) Retail Packaging Bolt - Grey,24.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31VQqq63lWL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2387},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B0090YGJ4I,A17771LTRWSKQ5,Helen S. Lam,"[1, 1]","This is my first Otterbox.  Wow, my svelte iPhone 5 is turned into a chunky tank that is at least twice as thick!  This case offers great protection with the clam box and then a hefty rubber outer armor.  The material is of high quality and looks durable enough to last for quite some time.PROS - 1)The hefty box offers great protection, far better than the typical silicone cases. 2)Most buttons are sealed to prevent dust or dirt. 3)The built-in screen-protector is a great feature.  I heard of others complaining about the watermark issue with the built-in protector so I added another screen-protector on the screen before putting the iPhone5 under the built-in screen-protector.  This seemed to have done the trick.  I don't have any watermark at all with the dual screen-protectors.  4) The product is made of high quality and durable materials.CONS - 1)A PAIN TO OPEN THE CLAM BOX!  I had such a hard time opening the clam box to insert my iPhone.  It was easy to open one side of the clam box but it was a struggle to pry open the other side.  The side-hinge kept closing by itself. It took me 15 minutes to ease it open by inserting my finger nail into the gaps to slowly pry it open.  It finally worked but it was so frustrating!  I hope that I won't need to open the clam box too often.  2) It is ironic that Otterbox puts a clear film on the apple logo while no such film is available for either the front or rear facing cameras.  What would you care more, a scratched apple logo or a scratched camera lens?  I don't understand why there is such a flaw in the design!  3) There is a very minute gap between the built-in screen protector and the actual screen.  As such, you need to put a bit more force on the built-in screen-protector to obtain the same results.I will keep this Otterbox as it offers the best protection for my iPhone.  This would be an amazing case if the clam box were easier to open and the two camera openings were actually sealed.One last thought...  With so many Otterbox counterfeits, I bought mine from Amazon as the seller (it's probably a few bucks more) and I definitely got a genuine case.  I wonder how many negative reviews were due to counterfeits from other sellers.  My clam box was a perfect fix, there is no fit issue as mentioned in some reviews.  I wonder whether the issue was caused by counterfeits?",4.0,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",OtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5 (Discontinued by Manufacturer) ( Not for iPhone 5C) Retail Packaging Bolt - Grey,24.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31VQqq63lWL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2387},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B0090YGJ4I,A2R3QGGH8AY1CH,IlyaF,"[0, 0]","The Otterbox Defender undoubtedly offers the most protection for your phone. It covers nearly every aspect of the iPhone with a thick layer of plastic and rubber. I bought this case for my iPhone 5s because I didn't find myself using the touch ID all too often. I picked this case up during a sale for $14.99 on Amazon.The biggest flaw in this case is the included screen protector. It's essentially a thick piece of plastic glued to the inside of the case. When the phone is inside the case, the screen protector does not lay completely adhered to the screen. Because of this, the screen requires extra pressure for a touch to register. It's incredibly annoying and quite audible if you're trying to text quickly. I ended up pulling the screen protector off which solves that problem but creates a new one. If you pull the protector out, you get a small gap that goes all around the screen making it really easy to trap dirt which only causes more damage.Another problem is the thickness combined with the grippy rubber material. The phone looks large in the pocket and the material makes it difficult to remove from the pocket. I know this is nitpicking but unless you have a job that absolutely requires such a case, I can't really recommend this product.

I love that it has a built-in screen protector and is made of a well-cushioned (I suppose silicone) material that protects the phone.  I've dropped it a few time with no damage.  I hate trying to apply individual stick-on screen protectors.  I never seem to be able to get all of the bubbles out.  The material is non-skid, so it won't easily slip off your dashboard or chair arm.  When I'm holding it, I feel like I have a good, comfortable grip.  Yes, it does add noticeable weight to the phone, but that doesn't bother me.While it's not water-PROOF, it does give you quite a bit of protection against rain or spills. Occasionally, you may get a bit of dust between the phone screen and the protector, but it's easy to remove it, wipe it off and put it back together.  When doing this, you should take care not to pull on the rubberized protector so much that you stretch it out of shape.  I learned that with the first case.

The rubber part of the old Otterbox got very floppy and loose, which I couldn't stand, and I hated the clip.  When I got the iPhone 5, I was going to wait for the Griffin to come out, but I really needed high protection so I bought the Otterbox.  I love it.  Yes, it is bulky - but I want maximum protection, so I really don't care about that.  It fits great, and the outer rubber part is much more firm and doesn't look like it will become loose over time.  The clip is a big improvement too - you can have the phone facing in our out, which is great.  And the case stays securely in the clip, so I never fear that it will fall out.  The only thing I don't like is the kickstand feature of the clip.  Because the top and bottom is unbalanced, you can only kickstand it in portrait view, and when you do use it - it puts the phone at a 90 degree angle so you can't really put it on the table next to you it's very awkward.

The Tech21 Impact provides very nearly the same level of protection from bumps and drops as the Otterbox, but at a fraction of the size and less cost.

The hard plastic shell has six points of click clousure rather then the three before. The rubber silicone skin seems tougher and firmer. The packaging is modern plastic rather than cardboard recyclable. Just on first handling it's much nicer than the previous gen, not diminishing the 4 series. I've dropped my iPhone and not a scratch or damage. It just protects it like nobodies business.I'll add more when I get my iPhone 5 and can fully test. This is so far, very impressive.Edit: I uploaded some pictures and also did a YouTube video unboxing, search ""iPhone 5 Otterbox Defender""Amazon removed my link.Edit: I added more photos. 9/18/12Edit: 9/22/12My iPhone 5 arrived yesterday. I assembled the Defender around it. It fits like a glove. The screen is crystal clear and touch is as responsive as on the glass itself. The underlying image is beautiful and clear, no distortion to my eyes. Based on the crazy lightness of the iPhone 5 the Defended 5 is fairly light to hold. I heard the 5 was lighter but when I compared it to my 4, WOW.Grip is good, I feel some ""sharpness"" on some grips that I never noticed on the 4. Nothing bad, just different. Two things I do notice are the bottom flaps. I have a headphone set with a medium large jack. It barely fits, it actually forces the Defender apart just a bit when I click it in. I'm also concerned that Apple's Lightning to Old Dock Connector adapter will either not fit or be VERY tight. I don't have one so I'll let the first reviewer who buys one comment. Just concerned.I also notice when wearing it on my belt it is easier to get to my pocket than the 4 was. It is trimmer by a good bit.

The fit is excellent, and the silicone case fits perfectly around the shell.  The new silicone looks like it will hold its shape longer, but only time will tell.  My concern is with the holster, which seems snugger.  They have redesigned the holster, and you have to get the phone into two lower tabs, push the phone into the tabs before locking it into place with the top latch, or else the latch pinches on the silicone liner just by the center groove, and I can see this being the point where the silicone gets cut down the road.....(hence the minus 1 star).

B0090YGJ4I,AGVYD8F7E5TLI,L. Hinrichsen,"[0, 0]","I had an older version of the Defender case for my iPhone 4 and bought a new one for my new iPhone 5.  I noticed two differences, although I'm sure there are many more that I just don't notice because they don't affect me.Plastic over rear-facing camera:  The old case had protective clear plastic covering the rear-facing (towards me) camera area, it was a small window, collected dirt, and was difficult to clean.  I used the rear-facing camera a lot because I used the phone to Skype quite frequently.  After a year or so that plastic got cloudy from so much dirt and cleaning, so I'd remove the case when I Skyped, then of course wouldn't get it put back on, etc.  The new case doesn't have plastic covering the rear-facing camera area, and the window is much larger, and therefore easier to clean.  I like it a lot better.Silicone outer cover is different:  The old case had a softer, more pliable, and &#34;gummier&#34; silicone case.  The camera wouldn't slide into my purse or pocket as easily, and collected dirt.  But the little flaps were very easy to open and close.  The new case has a harder outside layer, it is not at all sticky.  But the flaps (for the cable and for the volume off switch) are stiff and not as easy to open and close.  My son had one with similar plastic, and the flap covering the cable port cracked and broke off after a while.My last case held up really well for the two years I used it, but the clear plastic covering the face of it did get some scuffs and scratches.  I have a friend who uses the plastic screen protector film ON TOP OF the clear plastic of the Otter Box, and he said it works great.  I'm going to do that with this new one.",5.0,1374278400,"07 20, 2013",OtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5 (Discontinued by Manufacturer) ( Not for iPhone 5C) Retail Packaging Bolt - Grey,24.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31VQqq63lWL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2387},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

So far, these Iphone 5's have survived 5ft drops and bounces off counters. They show no signs of damage because of how the case is built. The case may seem larger than most, but this phone has the best shot of surviving a drop on the street where there are jagged raised points on the surface because the phone is set back in the case. The runner is very durable. It absorbs a lot of shock and should last you a long time. I purchased 2 of these cases for $45 on Amazon, way cheaper than the $50 for one case Bestbuy offers. We don't really use the holdsters, but the case itself is overall better. The defender series comes with a built in screen protector so you never have to buy an annoying one where you need to push the bubbles out. This one you put on and your done. Easiest screen protector ever. And I find the responsiveness of the phone is better with this screen protector on it.My only con with the Iphone 5 Otterbox Defender case is that the charging port is difficult to open.

Karazim,"[0, 0]","Original Review: Before I got this case I was using theAmazonBasics Protective TPU Case with Screen Protector for  iPhone 5 (Frost)which was nice and sleek but quickly became discolored and did not provide much protection.  Since I spent quite a bit on my phone I thought it best to protect it a little bit better.  I purchased two of these cases, the blue for my husband and the blush for myself, and so far we are both very pleased with them.Pros:*Great protection against drops.*Easy access to buttons.  Easy to push buttons.*Makes phone easier to hold on to.*Comes with built-in screen protector, no more annoying stick-ons!*Reasonably priced.Cons:*The blush is very bright pink.  It looked lighter in the picture online, and the hard plastic part looked white online.  It's actually gray.  The blue case was pretty true to color.*Our audio cables for the car did not work with the OtterBox.  They were too thick to fit the inner case.  We ended up purchasing two of theseMediabridge 3.5mm Male To 3.5mm Male Stereo Audio Cable - 8 Feet - Step Down Design accommodates iPhone, iTouch, SmartPhone and MP3 casescables to accommodate.  Now we can use with our MP3 input jacks in the car.*These cases do make the phone bulky.*The rubber part does attract a bit of purse and pocket lint, but it's not terrible and it comes off easily.After using these for a day we have decided they are keepers.Update 4-18-13The case fit loose from the start (the outside rubber part) which I did not notice at first.  My husband's case is nice and tight.  This got so annoying after awhile that I took the case off and got a different brand.

Having had an Otterbox for my 4 as well, I knew pretty much what I was getting into.Pros:- It was available when I got the phone.- I like the color selections (I have the Hunter Green, and it is Olive/ Hunter Green)- New rubber material is harder, sturdier feeling and it feels thinner than previous plastic, less squishy- Much less ""grippy"" for going in your pocket.- Combined with the phone's slimmer size, this case actually will fit in your pocket and come out easily- All the major stuff is covered save the speakers- Buttons are all accessible and headphone jack (with iPhone buds at least) accessible.- Feels toughCons:- Less grippy, do not leave on dashboard.- This new material has me worried.  Where the old cases eventually just disintegrated, I feel like the tab for the sync cable will break off long before the case  is out of commission.  It's already showing stress lines after a week.- Screen pop - this should only last a few days, screen will eventually get more flexible and lay down.- Grease spot screen - this also happened the first 5 days or so, but has now fixed it's self, just give it time- The hard black inner case is a nightmare to take off.  Do it over a couch or a pillow or something, your phone could pop out.  I have pretty nimble fingers and it was really hard to get it out, much worse than the old one.- The rigidity of the rubber makes peeling the hard case out pretty difficult too, you'll feel like you're breaking it, but you aren't.  Same with putting it back on, you have to be forceful with it.- As always, you lose all the design ascetics of the phone. But you also don't ding it all up in a month.Once the other companies catch up, I'll shelve the Otter unless I'm going on a trip or hiking or something.  Day to-day, for me, it's a bit much and I'm pretty careful with my phones so I'm not crazy worried.Also, I would get some sort of plastic screen protector for your phone first.

I eventually got a LifeProof case and really did like that one. When I bought the iPhone 5, the only rugged case Apple had was this case, so I bought it. First impressions...  it sure is big and kinda bulky. But does the job for protection. What I don't like about this case is that when you want to move your apps around, say to another page.. it's next to impossible with my finger to get the app to the next page, especially when going to the left. I actually had to move the case around a little bit to get a better angle on it so that the swipe would work. With the case off, I have no problem with this at all. I'm also not too big on how they designed the bottom of it and the angle of it. It just seems to sit too high right where the apps are when you put your finger there. Other than these, it seems pretty decent, but i'll still be getting the lipeproof case when it comes out for the iPhone 5. Hopefully they'll keep the same design as the 4/4S and just make it to form fit like the prior one..UPDATE 10/19/12:  I couldn't take it anymore. I was ready to rip this darn thing off my phone. I felt like I was carrying around a brick compared to what I was used to on the 4S, I hated how bulky it was, how haevy it felt with a thinner, lighter phone in it, and a pain to try to text and move apps around. So... I bought a Splash case with the screen protector and really like that one. Here is what I went with: http://www.amazon.com/Splash-Cruiser-Polycarbonate-Slider-iPhone/dp/B005SE9IIS/ref=cm_cr-mr-titleHopefully now that the iPhone 5 is out, Otterbox will do some fine tuning on their design and make it more user friendly. I was really disappointed on this one. Hopefully Otterbox reads these reviews and gets some ideas from the consumers thoughts on this. I dropped the Otterbox rating from 3 stars down to 2.

I really like the changes that Otterbox has made in the way the rubber engages the plastic inner liner with little to no gaps out of box. After a month of use I can say that the performance has been better than Defender cases I had on 4/4S cases. The port covers can be a challenge to open but you will quickly develop a method that works for you. The silence button is difficult to operate but that is a tradeoff with the port cover staying in place at all times. Two things I would change if given the chance are I would like to see a larger opening for the camera that would accommodate after-market lenses. The other change would be to either make the dock port larger to fit Apple 30-Pin adapter or offer a dock adapter from Otterbox that interfaces their case.,5.0,1365292800,"04 7, 2013",OtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5 (Discontinued by Manufacturer) ( Not for iPhone 5C) Retail Packaging Bolt - Grey,24.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31VQqq63lWL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2387},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"
B0090YGJ4I,A2JISE2I6HE4Y5,Peak Gazer,"[0, 0]","I used a Defender for my iphone 4 and it was terrific. The Defender for my Iphone 5 has been problematic. The fit between the silicone case and the holster was extremely tight, and the phone had to be forced into the holster. After grooves were eroded into the silicone case by the retainer clip, mounting and dismounting became a little easier. Unfortunately the retainer clip breaks after one to three months of use; I believe I have used four or five new retainer clips in the 14 months I have used this case. Each broke at the same part of the clip  The case, even when new, did not fit the phone well and frequent removal and cleaning was required. Eventually the silicone portion of the case stretched out and now bulges 3 to 4 millimeters away from the phone contours at the corners, giving the appearance of sagging breasts at the corners, and is loose in general on the phone. The flap over the ear phone socket has torn off. I have given up on the belt clip and carry the phone in my pocket (quite bulky) because I am clumsy and the case still provides excellent impact protection.Otterbox has tried to be helpful, sent me the new holsters free. They are aware of the problems with this case, but to my knowledge have not improved it. Now they offer to send me a new clip holder and a new silicone protector free if I send in pictures of the loose silicone rim. I'm debating whether it's worth it or not for two months of function before the clip breaks without me being aware of it and possibly causes me to lose the phone. I am investigating other phone cases with belt clips and/or loops, but will be watching to see if Otterbox improves the design and materials in the Defender in the future. I'm an Otterbox fan, and love the protection the Defender provides my phone, but would be hesitant to buy the current model.

The durable case will hold up to just about anything.Aesthetics: this thing is pretty awesome looking. Like if you had a transformer come to earth and replicate itself into an iPhone w/ defender case.  Pretty rugged but also comes in pinks and other colors for those ladies that wish it. Be sure to realize the case is THICK. You will lose the 'sleek' look of the iPhone 5 in this beast.Usability: I am able to use all ports and buttons with ease. Appears to be no problem w/ the dimensions nor design.  Comes w/ a handy holster if you are into that or you can still slide it into a pocket (man sized in my case, some women may want a more slender casing)Packaging: what a pain in the bottom to figure out how to open an otterbox!  You have to dig your finger nails up under the top of the casing where the rubber material meets the hard plastic in order to 'pull' the cover off and then move down the plastic casing while still pulling the rubber casing off.  Once this is done, you are easily able to figure out the rest.  Be sure to wipe your phone off and spray it with a can of air to get all the dust off and finger prints off.

I knew what I was receiving when purchasing, so I was confident it would protect the my new $299.99 purchase. I was especially in a hurry to get a case after the whole 'scuffgate' ordeal.I've noticed a few improvements.I think the material used to cover 'ports' is of a slightly, just slightly more stronger material. I managed to rip off my 4's defender port immediately, so far so good on this.The ports covers plug in much easier, I know in my previous two defender cases, I had to fight to get the port covers to go back into place, and even then they would not stay. In this new IPhone 5 case, it works great.They removed the ability for the holster to 'rachet' or move. It's in a fixed 90 degree position now. (I found this was a positive myself, I hated going to retrieve my phone and it would be in an odd position.)NegativesI don't have fingernails, and I find it hard to open any of the port covers at any time. I usually have to peel back the silicone casing near the port cover I'm trying to open to get a grip, or use a pen. Extra secure, or over secure?The only other slight change is that the opening on the front camera/microphone and the back camera/flash is kind of big. It could discourage a lot of people. I personally feel that it'd be pretty hard to drop the phone leave those portions exposed during a drop (maybe a corner!) It does leave some spacing for your fingerprints on the face/back of the phone, as well as.. possibly maybe dust or crumbs to slip under the film for the touch screen as there is no film on these two openings.Overall, I feel confident that my phone is protected in my Otterbox defender case, and although the price is a bit steep, I feel that it is worth protecting my investment.

B0090YGJ4I,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,Roger J. Buffington,"[0, 0]","My son recommended this OtterBox Defender for my new iPhone 5.  He certainly knows more about these things than I do, and this time his recommendation was right on the money.  This is a very high quality case for the iPhone 5.  The fit is impeccable -- it literally fits the iPhone 5 like a glove.  Basically this case is a hard plastic case surrounded by a rubberized outer housing that affords an excellent grip and which should cushion the iPhone 5 from the inevitable drops and jostling to which we all subject our iPhones. The lip around the screen is very well-recessed which should protect the screen protector from getting scratched if you set the iPhone down face-down, as we all sometimes do.  The case looks very professional.This case also comes with a built in screen protector.  My iPhone 5 already had a standard peel-on screen protector that I have chosen not to remove, but even with two layers of protection the touchscreen on the iPhone 5 works perfectly.  The rubberized surface for the on/off switch and the control button on the iPhone 5 work perfectly as well.  There are cut-outs for the front and rear camera lenses so no problem there.There is a rubberized fitting that fits over the lightning connector that is well-designed and which protects the connector.  Personally I probably would have been happy if the OtterBox simply left the connector unprotected, but in practice this arrangement works out well.About the only negative for this case is the inevitable fact that it adds a certain amount of bulk to the iPhone 5 as the price you pay for first-rate protection.  That is fine with me but if you are one of those folks who really insists upon having the slimmest iPhone possible this case may not be for you.  This case is definitely for me as I value the protection and like the appearance and utility of this case.The flip side of the extra bulk that this case imparts to the iPhone is that I like the heft of the phone when talking on it.  And while the OtterBox makes the phone larger, it adds very little weight, so that the iPhone 5 even in this case is a pretty lightweight accessory.  Nice.The Amazon price is a bargain.

The outer casing is a material that provides a great level of grip, but does not attract lint and dust like the older ones did.  The fit is incredibly snug.  I bout a cheaper case taht claimed to be the same as the Otterbox, and I hated it because it did not fit as tightly and attracted lint.  The case adds a little size and weight to the phone, but with the iPhone 5 I think that is a good thing.  The phone itself is so light that I am afraid of dropping it.  These cases will make your phone virtually indestructible, which is the whole point of course.  The only draw back to the Defender is that there is a tendency for an &#34;oil slick&#34; looking spot to develop between the phone screen and the clear protector.  This has been documented all over the internet.  The official explanation is that it is caused by static electricity.  I have read a lot of info that baby powder will keep it from appearing, but that has not worked for me.  I also read about rubbing a dryer sheet on the glass--this just smeared and looked terrible.  The Otterbox Commuter gives side and back protection, but not as much to the front.  This might be a good alternative for you if you can't handle the oily spot.  One would think that Otterbox could come up with something to combat or prevent this.

B0090YGJ4I,A3JECYF1VD4DGT,ShannonTampa,"[0, 0]","I bought this in February 2013 for my husband's iPhone 5. Because of the added protection, he did not mind that it was bulky or the gap between the screen and the clear face plate. He was initially very satisfied by the improved design and finish over the previous model. Within 6 months however, the clear screen was so scratched, fogged, and damaged that it was hard to see through. He only used screen cleaner or rubbing alcohol to clean the case and phone. Within 8 months, the outer silicone case has stretched out of shape enough to gap all of the way around and only fits snugly over the home button. By a year later, two of the silicone tabs that fit over openings like the charging port and mute button have torn completely off. He uses his phone a lot and carries it daily but he is not rough with it. The most wear likely comes from put the phone in and out of his pockets. In comparison, I have been using the Speck Smartflex View (moderate protection case with built in kickstand) continually since December 2013. My case is still in good shape. I don't mean to imply that the Speck case can provide as good of protection in all circumstances as the Otterbox but it has held up well and has seen a lot more handling than my husband's case.

Espinoza ""critic""","[1, 1]","I just bought this iphone 5 otterbox defender series case in bolt color the other day directly from otter box.com and I am in love with it. I owned the blue iphone 4 otterbox defender case and was extremely happy with it, but this newer version for the iphone 5 is even better. The rubber that covers the inner plastic shell is a lot harder, meaning it doesnt wiggle around. It is a little bit tougher to pull off and put on, but it gives that extra protection that I'm looking for. its also made a little different than the rubber outing compared to the iphone 4 defender case, making it easy to put into your pant pockets as well as making it easy to pull out. the one downside i can think of is that the front camera and receiver are exposed, as well as the back camera, flash and mic. in the previous defender case series, these were covered by a see through window. so if you've used your previous iphone 4 otterbox defender case in some light right, you would of been ok, but this new version has those areas exposed. But with the iphone 5, you dont need to look at ur iphone to respond to texts or to post to twitter/facebook, you have siri to do that for you, even to write emails.another big improvement is the clipcase that houses the defender casing. Its built a lot better to hold your otter box in place while its clipped to your waist line. I didnt used the previous one because it just didnt feel like it would hold my iphone 4 in place in the belt clip.All in all, this is a huge step up in quality, with that one minor issue, but its definitely worth a purchase.

B0090YGJ4I,A2QA25UQBWMKS6,"Steven P. Gatdula ""Steven G""","[0, 0]","The iPhone 5 Otterbox Defender case is much better than its predecessors.Pros:1) The external rubber layer has some plastic element to it so that it is easy to slide in/remove from your pocket without collecting any lint/dust.2) the external rubber layer is super snug around the inner plastic layer case.3) the entire case does not add bulk to the iPhone like its predecessors did.  Its amazingly much thinner and stronger than the previous Defender cases.4)  The front and rear cameras are wide open so that the case will not interfere with flash or cause any unwanted vignette.Con:1)  It is extremely hard to open and the port covers for all ports (mute button port, charging port, and ear phones port).2) It is difficult to access the mute button.  The case has a tiny opening to access the mute button & makes it difficult for a person like me with big fingers to mute my phone.2) The built-in screen protector reduces the image quality of the retina display.  (This can be resolved easily by removing the Otterbox screen protector itself. It sounds crazy, but you will love your iPhone and Defender case much more.  The native iPhone screen is already extremely anti-scratch resistant, finger smudge resistant with a tempered glass.  Ive never had problems or scratches on my screen. The built in screen protector for the Defender case may be redundant and not worth losing the image quality on your screen.)I definitely recommend this case to any iPhone user.  If you want a thinner case and not have the difficulty of 'breaking into Fort Knox' to access your ports, I would suggest looking at Speck Cases.

I have gone through 2 other otterbox defenders for the iPhone 5 and was a bit hesitant to even bother trading the 2nd one in for a 3rd one via warranty replacement.The first one I received quickly failed on the top left/right plastic insert the actual phone sits in. It would not clasp together anymore and I had to send it in. Also the built in screen protector became detached from the housing and let a lot of dust in. First OB gone.The second one I received the holster clip that the actual case clipped into made the silicon housing tear a bit. Also with both when I would plug the phone in to charge it seemed like there was a little play inside the case and you could actually shake the case and hear the iPhone sliding around inside of it.Third time...ITS THE CHARM. On this one the screen protector has stayed in place and even is sitting flush with the screen, so no little poof or getting used to having to hit the screen a bit harder when texting. Also there is no play inside the case and it even feels a lot more sturdy. The plastic housing snaps in place perfect and and even makes a snapping sound that sets my mind at ease. The one thing I noticed as well as on the other cases they said made in china somewhere on them and this one inside the case, and even on the clip says USA. Does the China versus USA assembly have something to do with the difference? I would say so in this case.Definitely recommend this case to anyone. It is leaps and bounds better than the case for the 4 and much slimmer.

The case for her iPod is still going strong after around a year's use, but this case started showing problems within the first month.

I have dropped my phone several times with absolutely no effect on the phone or the case.  Easy to assemble.  Like all Otterbox Defender cases, it seems high quality.  It does add bulk to the slim IPhone, but I knew that before I bought it.  I'm ok with the form factor.  All buttons are covered by the case, but I found the effect on the clickability of the buttons to be miniscule.  Also, the outer screen protector built into the case has only a minor (almost unnoticeable)  effect on the sensitivity of the touch screen.  Overall, well designed.I do have 2 complaints thought.  First, somehow moisture or condensation gets between the outer screen protector and the actual IPhone screen itself.  The result, at least for me, is that I get strange rainbow effects on the screen or the screen protector (can't tell which, and it doesn't matter, the effect is the same).  It's more of an annoyance than a major flaw, as the effects are relatively minor, and sometimes not even noticeable, depending on what is on the screen at the time, how the light is hitting the screen, etc.  Still, I do notice them from time to time, and they are slightly distracting. Second complaint is that the screen protector gets pretty dirty pretty easily pretty quickly. I am constantly having to clean the screen, more so than when the phone is not in the case.  Not sure why this is the case, but it just is.Am I keeping the case?  Yes.  Would I buy a different case if I had it to do over again?  Probably not, although it would be close.  For me, solid protection is the main reason I bought the case in the first place, and as noted above, I give this case a 5 for protection.

B0090YGJ4I,A3DZ7UB4R8JW6B,Zack,"[0, 0]","I bought this case for the iphone 5 because I want the best protecting possible for my phone for a few reasons. Firstly because buying a good case is a lot cheaper than potentially haveing to replace the phone, I can be rough on my phones and it makes me feel more confident holding my phone while doing demanding activities because I am not as worried about dropping my phone or getting it scratched. This particular otterbox offers the highest level of protection the company offers. I like the fact that it does not add a ton of ""bulkyness,"" to the device while still being pretty protective.There are disapointing aspects though. Firstly the case was not made as well as it could have been. There was some access rubber that had not been properly removed during production. The case seems to become weaker and does not fit together as it did the first time if you take it on and off your phone a few times. Also, the part of the phone that would touch the phone in the front above and around the screen is just solid plastic. It would be nice to have a rubber coating there to increase shock absorbsion and make sure the sureface of the phone is not scratched. Otterbox definitly has a superior product and they know that due to the high demand. For what it is, it is extremly overpriced but considering supply and demand it seems to be working out for the company. It just sucks knowing that I paid a lot more for a product than it is actually worth to get the ""otterbox."" I had a case on my droid x2 made by Incipio that was a full silicone case and then it had a second stage that was hard plastic that fit around the rubber. It was almost identicle to an otterbox, I found it on amazon for $12 I think and it lasted 2 years and is still in great shape and I have dropped my phone quite a bit; no scratches or anything on the phone.

It seems as though it was made in a rush due to the iPhone 5's coming out so suddenly because the dark purple rubber does not fit the phone and doesn't mold to it very well at all. It's stretched out and almost doesn't stay on the upper sides of the phone.The flap that covers the headphone jack and the lightening cable port are so poorly designed. They barely stay shut when I first put it on so I assume the more I use those flaps the more loose they'll become and eventually wont close at all. The sleep/wake button is difficult to press but not as hard as the last case that I tried by another brand and returned to Amazon. This is so frustrating to me because obviously that's a button that is pressed very often and they makes it VERY annoying. The volume buttons however are not terrible. They're alright to press through the case - slightly hard. Overall a DECENT case. The color and protection is on point, unfortunately the design and molding to the phone are very disappointing. I have yet to find a case that I love and that offers great protection. I don't think this case is bulky by any means. If you're looking for protection, it's a good thickness.

Although this case does bulk up the phone a bit it still maintains a more streamline style when you consider the protection. I love that the hard case is on the outside because that plastic means I can pull it easily from pocket or purse. Of course that also means it is more slippery in the hand as well.

The commuter case is nice because it is not as big as the defender series, but it still offers 2 layers of protection.  It still makes the phone easy to fit in a pocket but protects it in case you drop it.  The covers over the ports are nice as well as it gives the phone a little defense against moisture and the all evil pocket lent.  The only complaint is that it leaves the camera wide open, but most cases do anyway.Take advantage of all the different color options as well... iPhones seem to be the only line of phones they offer this variety in... probably because the phone is so universal.All in all, a great recommendation for any owner of this phone.",5.0,1383004800,"10 29, 2013",OtterBox [Commuter Series] Apple iPhone 5 &amp; iPhone 5S Case - Retail Packaging Protective Case for iPhone - Blue/Lime Green,34.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417iA9JRmTL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 7624},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B00974L0EA,A3Q2HYYMLJ9P10,A Prime Reviewer,"[0, 0]","This is my second otterbox case, the first being a defender. I found that there were serious problems with that particular case.The commuter offers good protection, but the smaller size makes it easier to carry around and the decreased thickness of the case makes texting far easier.My main concern is with build quality. The case simply looks and feels cheap. The inner rubber case simply does not hold it's shape. Even when placed inside the plastic shell, the rubber case still does not form straight lines along the edges. The rubber does not grip the sides of the case, it simply sits alongside the case, flopping around and moving easily.Another annoying aspect of the design is that the top power button is extremely difficult to activate with the rubber case attached. If you use this button regularly, this case design will frustrate you.The bottom line is that the use of cheap plastic and floppy rubber is anathema to the beautiful aluminum and glass design of the iphone itself. This case can be had for under $20 on amazon, but truth be told, you're getting a product with about a dollar or so of manufacturing materials.The case should protect the phone from drops, but it looks and feels cheap.",3.0,1358726400,"01 21, 2013",OtterBox [Commuter Series] Apple iPhone 5 &amp; iPhone 5S Case - Retail Packaging Protective Case for iPhone - Blue/Lime Green,34.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417iA9JRmTL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 7624},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B00974L0EA,AE12AEJFCOGGY,"David Montgomery ""Book Critic""","[0, 0]","I tried out 3 cases for the iPhone 5: the Speck PixelSkin HD, the OtterBox Commuter and the Otterbox Defender. I thought each of them was well designed and useful, but they serve different purposes.The Speck PixelSkin was my wife's favorite. It's very slim and unobtrusive, highlighting the sleek design of the new iPhone. However, I didn't think it offered very much protection. I was afraid that it wouldn't protect against the inevitable drops. If you're just looking for a minor amount of protection and a little extra grip, this is a great case.The Otterbox Defender is at the opposite end of the spectrum. You could probably throw your phone out the window if it's in one of these and it would be okay. But that protection comes with a cost -- it added way too much bulk for me. This case is big and thick, and probably more than most people need.I ended up going with the one in the middle: the OtterBox Commuter.

B00974L0EA,AAYB56GHHGB6R,D. Fox,"[0, 0]","I love the otterbox cases, they seem to add the most protection for the minimum added bulk. I use them on my Samsung Galaxy S3 and Iphone 4. This case still adds the protection I want, but the case fit just doesn't seem as good as previous ones. the cover for the charge port never stays closed (even when new), and on the sides it just never feels like the plastic outer clip has fully ""snapped"" into place around the silicone inner case. I have never used there screen protectors, I prefer the Tech Armor HD.One added benefit I have found for this case, is if you are willing to file down the radius corners of a 30-pin lightning adapter it will then fit in between the two speaker openings on the bottom of this case, no need to remove the case everytime you need to use a 30-pin connector instead of the lightning. This is perfect for us since we use the iphone with a USASpec Honda adapter to listen and view song info in our car.UPDATE 10/8/13: This case has not held up as well as our previous 4S case or my Galaxy S3 case, both of those lasted multiple falls and some harsh toddler treatment. this one began to break off pieces. first the bottom section cracked on one side, and eventually came off. than just a week ago it dropped and the whole top section broke off. I am not sure if this item came from a more brittle batch of polycarb. It still has protected the phone during these falls, but with pieces coming off, I am not sure how much longer it will continue to protect the phone.

One of the features I like the best about it is the rising up around the front of the phone so if you drop it on it's face nothing will happen to the screen. This case in my opinion is one of the best cases to get if you want a case that isn't to heavy or bulky, is easy to take on and off, isn't to expensive, and provides overall decent protection.I do have two things I dislike about this case though. The first is my color choice, just a warning don't pick white! I thought it wouldn't matter because the case seems to clean easily and for a while it didn't but around the back there are these little ridges that sink in and they catch dirt that is really hard to clean out of the case itself (doesn't affect the phone) that's my personal problem nothing against the case. The bigger problem though is the hole in the back displaying the Apple Logo. This DOES NOT have a covering, it is just an open hole that exposes that part of the iPhone to everything, they should have covered it up like in the Defender Series.Overall though this is a great product that is a good choice if you can't find the &#34;perfect&#34; case; a good placeholder case until that one right case is found.",4.0,1372723200,"07 2, 2013",OtterBox [Commuter Series] Apple iPhone 5 &amp; iPhone 5S Case - Retail Packaging Protective Case for iPhone - Blue/Lime Green,34.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417iA9JRmTL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 7624},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

While it does bulk up the slim lines of the iPhone 5, I don't care about that. I care about the protection, and was willing to give up slim for safety.I like it better than the Defender series because it's lighter and the screen protector is separate. I have a problem with watermarks on the Defender on my 4S, and wanted to avoid that with this case.  However, I didn't care for the screen protector that came with it, and replaced it with the Tech Armor Apple New iPhone 5 High Definition (HD) Clear Screen Protector with Lifetime Replacement Warranty (3-Pack) [AT&T;, Verizon. Sprint, International and Unlocked iPhone 5 Models], which is a more ""invisible"" protector and does a great job.If you are looking to maintain the slim lines of your iPhone 5, this is not the case for you.  If you only care about protecting your phone but still have a little pizzazz, then try the Otterbox.  Best bang for the buck that you'll get to protect your $$$ iPhone.Oh yeah - one more thing.

They sent me the exact same one and I continued to use it from January 2012 until yesterday (beginning Jan 2013). I will not lower my opinion of Otterbox for my first case being a lemon, as my whole family uses the Otterbox products and that is the only factory defect we have had, which, to me, makes it an understandable, random bad egg not a consistent pattern of defect.Pros-The case did an incredible job of protecting my phone. I am a klutz, and I dropped my phone...a lot... and my phone was safe and sound.-The pink plastic case is much more attractive than some other case colors I have seen, and this style Otterbox comes with better color combos than the Defender.-For the amount of protection given, it did not add much bulk. I'm not one of those people who wants protection for my phone and then complains it's no longer as skinny as the iPhone is on its own. That's ridiculous. It was a reasonable compromise on bulk for protection. Still slips into my pocket (and I'm a woman).-The camera works perfectly with the case onCons-The white becomes FILTHY very quickly. I clean my case frequently, and am a hygienic person, but no matter what I did the white became a very gross gray. I would NOT suggest this color combo when purchasing this item. The pink case itself is wonderful (LOVE the color), but the white becomes unattractive VERY quickly, and I could not ever get it to clean up back to white. It was especially embarrassing to have it look so dirty during business meetings, etc.I just switched from this case, as I dropped it so many times my case has fragmented and cracked to an unusable point -- but my phone didn't get damaged during any of those falls and it took a year of me (and my pets) knocking it to the floor (and constantly having to take it out of the case to put it in my music player dock) for it finally cry uncle. I don't think that's the fault of Otterbox, I think that means Otterbox did its job. A year of protecting my phone from me! I have now purchased and am using the Defender, since I apparently am in need of full blown body armor on my phone.",4.0,1357603200,"01 8, 2013",OtterBox [Commuter Series] Apple iPhone 5 &amp; iPhone 5S Case - Retail Packaging Protective Case for iPhone - Blue/Lime Green,34.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417iA9JRmTL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 7624},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

The fit and quality just isn't the same.... sorry to say.  This is the first time I've gone with the Communter Series, having always used the Otterbox Defender Series cases for my iPhone 3, then iPhone 3Gs, then my iPhone 4s.Problem #1: The screen protector was a pain to put on, and I've used these kinds of screen protectors on other devices before.  I think it was just a hair too big, so when you put the silicon liner on the phone, it would lift the one edge of the screen protector, creating a bubble.  Moved the screen protector over a smidge, and the other side began to lift.  In the end, I just dumped the screen protector in frustration.Problem #2: The silicon liner is NOT a perfect fit.  The edges don't come up around the front glass quite right, so the edges are always curled or not straight.... When you put the hard shell on, it protects the phone quite nicely.... not as well as the Defender series case, but then, this one is not meant to be as thick a case.  So the really annoying part is the two flaps at the bottom of the case, that cover the headphone jack and the charging port, are not long enough to cover the whole port, and so you cannot close them.

They had a little give to them which I expected from a great product.

After a couple of months using this, they are not loose and still fit into the grooves. I read some reviews that complained about this but I haven't come across this problem.*The case is durable and does not add bulkiness. I dropped the phone on a hard surface (not a long distance or on purpose) and it was fine. No chips to the case and it stayed white shockingly. In fact, the case is still white which is an added plus.*The shipping was fast and came way before the promised date.*The cut out hole for the camera is great and there is no blurriness in the photos or reflections from the side.*There is a cutout for the apple logo so you can still show off the shiny chrome colored apple.*It looks pleasing to the eyeReally if you want an honest seller with a great case this is the way to go.

B00974L0EA,A2BYFGD27QAIOG,Lee,"[0, 0]","Personally I've always had good vibes with the Otterbox commuter series.  I had one on my Ipod, which held up great, and I had one on my Galaxy S3 that was massively great protection without all the bulk.  So I felt fairly good about my purchase of the Otterbox commuter case for my new Iphone 5S.  I purchased the color Punk, which comes with a hard outer shell in a light neon green color, and a soft rubberized inner lining that is dark blue in color. I immediately put my case on as soon as my phone came in, and it was a breeze putting it on.  All the ports are covered, such as the power button, volume keys, and the bottom audio jack as well as the lightning connector.  The only thing visible is the screen, the speaker, the little button above the volume keys, the camera, and there is a hole in the back so the Apple logo can appear through.  This also came with a screen protector, but I chose to purchase a separate one simply because the one that came with the Otterbox had large cutouts so some of the screen was unprotected around the earpiece/sensor, and home button.  Just as a little lagniappe the screen protector I bought had a back protector too, so I made sure to put this on so the logo area doesn't scratch up (brand was Spigen).  I see people had issues with pressing the power button, and mine is a little hard to press, but it isn't bad at all.  My Otterbox commuter case for my Ipod was way hard to press down, but over time it loosened up, and I'm guessing this will too.  The volume keys are very easy to press, and offer no resistance whatsoever.  The area housing the screen does have a small lip to it so you can put your phone screen first on a table, and the lip raises the device so the screen won't touch it.  All in all this is a nice light case, but I will say the protection does leave something to be desired.  The commuter case I got for my Galaxy was pretty darn impressive with hard plastic over the silicone lining that covered even the sides, whereas this case for the Iphone has more rubber than hard casing.  I'm afraid if it does drop from a sizable distance that it will definitely break my phone. Not something you want with an expensive device.  So currently I have the case on my phone to prevent it from scratches, and it does look great, but I think I'll try to find something else that has a little more drop worthy protection.",3.0,1381190400,"10 8, 2013",OtterBox [Commuter Series] Apple iPhone 5 &amp; iPhone 5S Case - Retail Packaging Protective Case for iPhone - Blue/Lime Green,34.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417iA9JRmTL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 7624},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

The first case I had didnt fit too well (silicone layer didnt match up with the plastic shell and was jagged in certain areas) so I opted for a replacement. Amazon told me to keep the one that didnt fit all that well and they will send me a replacement right away. They overnighted me a new case but I noticed that one had the same issues, and was actually worse than the first one. I decided to cut my losses and I gave the cases away. Otterbox needs some better quality control, however, Amazons customer service is awesome!!Quality control issues aside, there were some things I liked and didn't like about the case. The case's plastic shell feels like a plastic cooler type of plastic so it is very slippery. Match the slipperiness with the fact the sleep/wake button takes some force to press, and you end up with a device that may just slip out of your hands every time you go to lock/unlock or turn the device off. The volume buttons and silent switch were easily accessible.  This case does add tons of bulk to the device, but not so much that it is unmanageable. The bulk of the case didnt actually bother me at all. I did like the protection it offered and the significant sized lip on the front of the case providing a great lay on the table design.Overall, if the hard shell matched up nicely with the silicone layer and the case wasn't so slippery, this would have been my new favorite case. With the combo of the case being slippery and the sleep/power button being harder to press, it was a disaster waiting to happen, and it wasn't going to happen to my phone.

B00974L0EA,A3NA3TWQJV8AKP,scmillion,"[0, 1]","Let me first open by saying that I DID NOT purchase this product through Amazon, but through the Otterbox website as the preorder was not yet available on Amazon at the time ordering. That being said, here is my take on the case. When first opening the box and looking at the case, it looks and feels like it is well constructed and uses high grade materials. However, it is somewhat bulkier than I expected it to be. After putting the case on the phone (I did not apply the screen protector as I will be using a wet application type) these were my initial observations:-The inner silicon layer (before adding the hard shell) is a tight fit and the buttons appear line up just right as well as the port covers on the bottom.-The lip around the edge is of the screen is extremely pronounced. Not enough to hinder usage, but enough to make you wonder why they didn't take it down at least a tad. It does look like it will come over the edge far enough not to obstruct a screen protector if one is applied.-The hard plastic cover fits very snug over the silicon layer and lines up just right with the buttons and port flaps.-Volume buttons are just firm enough and have a very nice ""click"" feel to them, but the power is button takes noticeably more exertion to press.-There is very slight bulge at the corners on the silicon layer when hard case is on, not enough to detour the overall protection though.-Port flaps stay tucked into the plastic case.-Just dropping the phone about a foot or two above my table gives the impression this phone is EXTREMELY protected.I have now had the case on for over a week with regular usage and these are a few things I would add:-The power button is much easier to press now, I assume this is due the silicon softening up a bit.-The port flaps are still staying tucked in nicely, but I am thinking once I purchase the adapter, these flaps will be a bit hinder-some.-The slight bulge of the silicon layer at the corners, oddly enough, seems a little less now.-While there is still a good seal between the screen and the lip of the case, a LOT of dust and lint gathers around the lip, though it's hard to blame Otterbox for this.I think it would have been to Otterbox's benefit to consider using a TPU inner layer as opposed to silicon, it stays much cleaner, though I realize this would make the port flaps harder to work with. Having now seen someone with the iPhone 5  Defender case, I understand how progression-wise the Commuter is the ""sleeker"" version, because it definitely is less bulky. However, my main reason for only giving this case four stars is because I feel the size of the lip could have been reduced which would have thus resulted in a slimmer case just as equally protective.",4.0,1349222400,"10 3, 2012",OtterBox [Commuter Series] Apple iPhone 5 &amp; iPhone 5S Case - Retail Packaging Protective Case for iPhone - Blue/Lime Green,34.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417iA9JRmTL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 7624},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B00974L1SA,AQFY93BAZUL2I,Jeffrey Ferguson,"[0, 0]","After having a Reflex on my iPhone 4 for over a year, the only logical decision for my iPhone 5 was to continue using one. Thankfully, OtterBox has delivered another great product. In form and function both, the Reflex is everything you could possibly want in an iPhone protective case. (Having dropped my iPhone 4 on concrete a few times in its case, there were no scratches or blemishes when I traded it in for my 5, which allowed for an amazing buy-back amount from the carrier.)The fit is extremely tight, and I have not experienced any of the slipping or case-unexpectedly-coming-apart as other reviewers have. OtterBox has improved the design over the previous model, and the silicone border over the front allows for easy on/off without destroying the screen protector like the 4/4S did.The headphone jack outlet could be a little wider to accommodate some larger headphone jacks (my L-shaped connector worked just fine), but I can't take points off when I have no problem accessing the jack or the Lightning outlet with OEM material.As with other reviewers, I originally found the volume buttons and sleep button to be difficult to depress, but if you work those and break them in a little before installation, they should be easier to use once on your iPhone. The depth of the case at the ringer/silent toggle is deep, but not too deep or prohibitive to switch modes if you have any length of fingernail.Overall, it's as close to perfect as a case can be, and I'll continue to use and recommend OtterBox for future protective case needs.**UPDATE**This case stayed together for about six months, until the bottom bottom portion cracked at the headphone jack. As it kept bothering me, I finally cut off the entire bottom front guard until I got on here and purchased a Spigen Tough Armor.

For me finding the perfect phone case is difficult, while I want to have a reasonable amount of protection for my phone I don't want to add bulk to it because whats the point of buying a sleek new phone if you just wrap it in a bulky case.I have bought an Otterbox Commuter for my last 2 phones.  On my Evo it lasted a while but that was a bulky phone already.  On my iphone 5 I ditched it after a few days because the lip around the screen was too tall and made typing harder.  I ended up getting a basic Belkin case which didn't offer much protection but it was better than nothing.  I have found that I like the slider type cases because they are hard shelled but don't add too much bulk.  The Belkin case also didn't allow docking the phone in my alarm clock with the lightning adapter.This is the best of those type of cases by far because it has a little bit of rubber around the phone for a little added shock protection and its stylish.  I also was thinking to dock it I would just have to remove the bottom half of the case but as it turns out it docks with the lightning adapter perfectly without removing anything!The only downside I have found with this case is that I bought the Vapor edition which has a semi transparent back.  Like the picture it has the Otterbox logo and a box looking thing which one would thing is to tell you where to push to disengage the two pieces but in fact you push the other side so I can't figure out what its purpose is.  But in addition it has a bunch of other markings like 4 patent logos, made in china, and [...].

B00974L1SA,AQ3GHT17PGSBL,Will Klinger,"[0, 0]","I've been using this case for about two weeks, and really enjoy the relative slimness and sturdiness of the case. I wanted something that was not too bulky and could easily be removed for docking. This case meets both of those needs perfectly. There are, however, a couple of drawbacks that some users may be able to overlook; others perhaps not:-While the case easily slides on and off of the phone, the two halves often separate during normal usage. That's not to say that the case would pop off if dropped, but rather when taking it in and out of my pocket it will separate a bit and I have to push the halves back together. There is no &#34;click&#34; when the halves are joined around the phone.-Some users her have complained about how the volume and home buttons are hard to press through the case. This is true for the volume buttons; the home button is not hard to press as long as the top half of the case is firmly against the top half of the phone. This relates back to my first point where the case can sometimes become dislodged during normal usage.-To address another point regarding the area around the lightning port and speakers: this part of the plastic does seem a bit thin and I could see how it would break easily if dropped directly on this location or if it catches on something.-Lastly, a note about the screen protector. There is a little tab glued to the protector that allows you to hold it while you apply. Amazingly, this tab is attached to the protector using that annoying glue that does not peel right off (think of a price sticker that leaves the white backing when you try to peel it off). I was floored by this, but with some goo-gone I was able to get the reside off.Bottom line, I feel comfortable that this case would protect my phone against a drop, but consider another product if you prefer firm and tight cases that don't budge during normal usage. I also think that all things considered, it is a bit overpriced.

B009JQZDJO,A2ZFY7F6DN9H0Y,"Gary L. Hall ""Gary""","[51, 57]","I explicitly waited for this case to become available and I am very sorry. If your primary concern is to protect from drop damage then the case is spectacular, as would be expected from Otterbox. But in all other areas I expect better for this price.My main problem is that the wraparound edge on the screen side is too deep and instrusive. Some overall bulk was expected but I can't help feeling that this is just an innefficient design flaw. I have a hard time using the touchscreen around the edges. I almost need a stylus now. It also seems unnecessarily bulky on the front, adding a 3mm lip all the way around the screen. That alone increases the total depth of the phone by 33%. Add another 3-4mm on the back (the case tapers slightly from top to bottom on the back) and the phone has almost doubled in size. And this is the commuter version. I shudder to think about how massive the Defender series might be.Another advertised feature is the dust protection. This is half true. The headphone jack has a cover flap and the side buttons are covered but there is no protection at all for the USB or HDMI slots. I really don't understand why not. I thought, ""Maybe it was intentional so you could use the motorola car dock?"". Nope, it doesn't fit in the dock anyway.The case also comes with a screen scratch protector... but it is not specific to the RAZR MAXX HD. In fact, it really only cover the touchscreen area but leaves small gaps on the sides and large gaps at the top and bottom. The screen protector does not have any overlap with the case itself. The spaces inbetween have become dust magnets within a day. The plastic used also seemingly magnifies and highlights fingerprints making them much more noticeable requiring me to clean the screen almost obsessively. Why, after spending upwards of $40 do I need to then re-shop for a screen protector that covers the entire glass surface?The cutouts for speaker, camera, and microphone are spot on. Other than the size, the asthetics are also well done.The decision to return this thing was solidified when after installing the case, someone asked me, ""What happened to your new phone?"" thinking I had lost it and had reverted to an old blocky phone from 4 years ago.It will protect your phone from drops but I can't name another redeeming quality.  Also, I had a terrible time ordering this directly from otterbox and then also in returning it. If you are going to try it out, I would buy it here on amazon or from another retailer instead of direct from otterbox.Update 12/18/12:  for those looking for a smaller profile protection, I am really very happy with the Diztronic case:Diztronic Matte Back Black Flexible TPU Case for Motorola Droid Razr Maxx HD [ONLY FOR MAXX HD MODEL] (Verizon) [Retail Packaging] and a skinomi screen protectorSkinomi TechSkin - Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX HD Screen Protector Ultra Clear Shield + Lifetime Warranty",2.0,1354579200,"12 4, 2012",OtterBox Commuter Series Case for Motorola RAZR MAXX HD - Retail Packaging - Black,14.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JHobEoVqL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2880},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies']]"

Plus I can put the phone in my back pocket and not worry about taking it out when I sit down if I so choose.Screen protector is the only part that I don't like that much.  It is a tad glossy for my liking and also seems to make my touchscreen not as sensitive (but what would you expect).All in all, buy this case!  You will not be disappointed.I should add that this case WILL NOT work with the vehicle navigation dock that Moto sells.  I have tried taking the silicone skin off of the plastic case and it still does not work as it pushes the phone forward a bit, making the USB connector not line up properly in the CarDock...

The Commuter has a hard outer layer which may hold the shape of the silicone inner layer better. I find that this case seems to work pretty well. I dropped my phone with it on almost immediately on a tile floor with no apparent damage. The screen is brighter without the built-in shield on the defender, and the Commuter package comes with a self-adhering screen protector separately. The outer plastic shell is pretty slick, but I've had no issues with losing my grip. It allows for easier transition into and out of my pocket than the Defender.

B009NY9UIM,A1EQ7USL20LYX7,Ryan McDermott,"[13, 15]","So this is my second commuter case, I previously had a Droid RAZR regular with the commuter and loved the case. There are some substantial differences between this case and that one.Before that let me say this... If anyone from Otter Box happens to read these reviews, I don't know what you guys were thinking but that stupid little remove after installation decal on the screen protector certainly didn't need the rubber cement adhesive you used on it. It almost destroyed the screen protector during removal and took like an hours work of thumb rubbing to get all the left over glue off. Horrible. Fix it.Difference 1:The ""silicone"" inner cover that everyone is familiar with the soft squishy semi sticky feel of silicone is no longer made of or at least no longer resembles silicone. Its something much harder a very firm rubber very much like the rubber of a car tire. So far this has been give or take for me, the good thing is that lint and pocket crud no longer clings to the case like it did on the old one, however I believe this may have reduced the shock absorbing properties of the case as it is much firmer rubber borderline plastic hard. It still has a decent amount of friction if you put it on a table face down like the last one did but not near as much. The outside of the case is unchanged.Difference 2:The port cover for the charger is gone... This may be important to some people but honestly that stupid flimsy rubber flap on my last case almost got cut off on multiple occasions it would always pop open in your pocket and you'd have to push it back into its hole every time you looked at your phone, You lost some I dunno ""rain"" protection for your ports however that is probably unnecessary as this phones charging/hdmi port is on the side now where the last phone had them on the top. The headphone jack is still on the top and has a much more functional very firm never comes undone cover on it still.Difference 3:Cool new colors, definitely a plus I got the pavement it looks so much better than just a black brick.Impressions...Well I don't like that the outer plastic case has an extremely thin section around the charging port I am sure it will be fine but it looks easily breakable.The harder plastic makes it harder to push the side buttons as well but you get used to it quickly it doesn't take away anything from the function.I really like the lack of pocket lint on the phone. Its a fair trade for the harder rubber.I personally like the lack of flap over the charging port. I still fits and works in the lapdock 100 as well.Cover doesn't interfere with any functions of the phone.4 stars because screen protector made me want to fight people during install and I would like to see more colors available for such a popular phone. I get tired of standing in line at the coffee stand with 2 people in front of me and one behind with the same exact phone and case.-------------------------------------------------------------Review after a couple weeks usage... 2 Stars.The colored ""rubber"" case or whatever the inner part is made of now, it no longer appears to be silicone... Collects dirt and grease and disgusting crud like it was meant to I have to put my otterbox in the dishwasher every 3 days as it turns brown and looks like I used it to wipe after that amount of time... I never had this problem with my old silicone black one on the razr regular. The extremely thin bar of plastic near the charging port that I mentioned, while it hasn't broken YET, I hate it, it flexes constantly and makes you nervous that you will break it, and the big cut out around the charging/hdmi ports really throws the lines of the phone off and makes a beautiful phone ugly. This case is also noticeably thicker than my razr regulars commuter seemed to be. The included screen protector is a joke gets scratched up in a week ordered a skinomi screen protector that's working great for me. The bottom of the phone near the mouth piece has a sort of skeletal construction built into the rubber inner sleeve that while offering excellent protection makes the case seem ill fitting and sloppy near the bottom.Bottom line the only improvement on this case over the old commuter is the headphone port cover the rest of it is a joke and may have ruined the company for me which I once swore by.If you must buy it get the all black one or you will hate life, I would also recommend the defender if you must have an otterbox for your razr hd while it may be larger it fits and looks better, I am switching over to the driztronic TPU case I have geeksquad insurace against any actual damage the phone is going to incur anyway and the TPU will save it from cosmetic stuff.",2.0,1360108800,"02 6, 2013",OtterBox Commuter Series Case for Motorola RAZR HD - Retail Packaging - Black,4.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51la5dkcMSL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3911},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies']]"

I am happy overall as it does a great job of protecting the phone, but there are 3 issues.1) the screen protector is terrible. I'm not a fan of screen protectors in the first place but this one hovers a millimeter or two away from the screen, allowing dust and sand in behind it. It also makes the touch aspect crappy, which is the whole reason we bought the phone in the first place.2) the holster clip is horrible. The clip is directly in the middle of the hosted. So if you clip it on your front pocket it feels like it is going to fall off all day. The clip should be up towards the top of the holster.3) there is hard plastic sticking out past the rubber on the sides. I watch TV on my phone. I hate the holster so I don't carry it. I lean the phone up against things so I can watch it and it falls over because the clips for the holster stick out past the rubber case.

B00A21L2WM,A165RSDPPRNXJI,Anthony Ricciardi,"[0, 1]","I had an OtterBox for my old phone, an HTC Incredible, and it performed greatly beyond expectations with drops, bumps, and impacts. Maybe the design for the Galaxy Note 2 is just a poor one for this case since on the first drop of the phone it not only cracked the screen (slightly) but also fried the internals of the device rendering it un-usable.I had been rather careful since it was such a large screen I wanted to make sure it was safe, I went with the larger OtterBox thinking it would be better protection against falls. I was getting out of a Honda Civic when the phone fell from my lap, maybe 2 feet, and the impact rendered it useless. I think maybe if I had dropped it previous times it would be reason for it to die but not on the first drop, very very disappointing since I carried around this huge case for seemingly nothing. I would have been better off with the &#34;commuter&#34; case since it's slightly smaller and the benefit of the larger case is not impact protection (apparently).I would give this product a 1 star review for the fact that the first drop killed my phone and for how annoying the dirt and dust problem is, but having an OtterBox before makes me think that the design for this phone just isn't as top-notch as the others and I do still trust the brand. I would regrettably like a refund or even an offer to exchange for a commuter case since I don't see the point in having such an enormous case if not to protect from short falls. maybe I just got a defective case that was a MM off or something and that caused my Note to rattle it's brains out, maybe not.

It's close to 5 stars, but I would have rated 4.5 if I could.The good:It adds much needed durability to the SGN2.It gives you a great grip on an otherwise slippery phone.Looks great without adding too much bulk.The bad***:The screen protector. It covers the screen, but there is a very noticeable air gap between the screen protector and the phone screen. What's worse, the screen protector has a cut-out over the home key that allows dirt and dust to build up inside. And, possibly the biggest problem with the screen protector would be that it gets marked by using the S-pen! It's slight, but completely unacceptable for a product like the SGN2.The solution:As others have pointed out, one could simply replace the screen protector. Please note, doing so might void any warranty. If you still want to modify things, then simply apply a different company's screen protector, peel off the otterbox screen protector from its housing and discard it, then cover your SGN2 with the remainder of the otterbox. Good luck.***///UPDATE 2013-01-19Although the air gap between the screen protector and the phone screen is still undesirable for me personally, it seems to add even greater durability.

B00A21L2WM,A8QAOMRX0JLXJ,Bill Clark,"[6, 7]","* Four updates below:This is a nice case that will very likely protect my phone and its screen.  I will continue to use it despite its flaws because there is nothing that comes close.If you are familiar with the OtterBox Defender series, this case holds few surprises.  This is my first and other reviews point out some things to think about.If you are not familiar, then you should know you are buying a hardshell case with a slight foam panel inside to help protect your phone in the event of a fall. On top of that shell snaps a screen protector that has a cut-out for the home button. Make sure your screen is clean and that the protector is clean on both sides before putting it on because it is somewhat hard to remove the top. It is this piece that is the most objectionable part of the entire case.  The hole for the home button simply extends the faulty design choice Samsung made when they included the button.  I'm not sure OtterBox had very many real choices on how to deal with the button, so I don't blame them for the hole in the screen protector.  The protector does not lay flat on your screen, but that air gap has yet to cause me any real issues.  The largest problem with it though is that it isn't very clear.  I used lens cleaning wipes on it hoping that it would be better, and it was--slightly.  The result isn't real bad but as others have pointed out, if you are picky about such things--and you deserve to be at this price--this will disappoint you.(* Update:  The s pen can leave scratches or trails on the plastic and it does seem to affect some touch sensitivity.  This coupled with making my screen harder to see in sunlight prompted me to remove the screen protector. If you press carefully along its edge, you can remove it as well as its adhesive.  A normal screen protector will replace it.)The next piece to the case is a soft shell cover that gives it some grip.  The total affect at this point doesn't give you as much bulk as you might expect, but it does increase the bulk considerably.  It will not fit in the Samsung dock with this case in place.  The soft shell has those bothersome dust covers for the power and headphone ports, a pair of scissors will remove them easily if they bother you.  Yes, you might get some dust in them, but they will be no worse than the external speaker.  One reviewer mentioned an echo while using the soft case and I cannot see how such an echo is possible considering the location of the microphone.  Either way, I have not gotten any reports of an echo yet.Lastly you get a belt clip holster that is one of the most secure designs I've seen for such a holster.  It doubles as a stand by opening the clip all the way until it clicks.  The piece of plastic that it clips to though has sharp corners that can dig into you uncomfortably and I an concerned that it may wear a hole in my dress shirts.  I've tried sanding the corners with some slight benefit.(* Update:  The piece of plastic mentioned above broke within three months of ownership.  It broke while lifting it to close the belt-clip--in other words, it broke during normal operations in three months. The case and holster are still functional, but three months takes product quality into the one-star range.  I'll leave it at two stars because its main function is to protect the phone, but breakage this early is inexcusable.)(* Update again: Shortly after writing that last update the top part of the hard shell broke (tore slightly actually) as I was trying to remove it.  While it still works, product quality can no longer be excused by saying that it still protects the phone.)(* Final update:  The belt clip broke making mine a pocket phone.  That makes its useful life somewhere around 8 months.  Mine did not have a rough life. I will not buy another. The case BTW is still usable except that as a pocket phone the case is too bulky.)In spite of my low rating, this case can only be sold at this price because it is in a category by itself.",1.0,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",OtterBox Defender Series Case and Holster for Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - Black,33.73,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Pe3DM6GIL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3100},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

I had an invisible shield by zagg screen protector already on it, and I prefer it much more than a dust collecting, no contact to the screen, finger print magnet of a screen protector on my phone. For thoughts who are wondering, it's VERY easy to pop off. Apply some pressure, and peel off. Depending on how you did it, the glue should come off with it.Pros :- Gives more grip.- Feels great in the hand (This may vary, my hands are huge, so the size doesn't bother me at all).- 3 layer protection.- Ports are covered up- Pretty stylish- Holster is very easy to deal with, just pop off. Compared to other holsters where you have to slide it off, which can be hazardous for the phone (Easily slides off and hits the ground).Cons :- The S Pen port is exposed.

I think it may be slightly overpriced as I had a case similar to the Rhino ( could had been but looked different than what they sell now ) which was more protective and less expensive.

With all the positive reports I have heard about it I am a little disappointed but not losing sleep. It will protect the phone and if the on off button was easier to use I may give it a 4 star rating but a 3 1/2 star would be what I think about it. I would shop around.

Edwards ""ScottGeek""","[0, 0]","Lots has been written about OtterBox cases... and I find that people either like them, hate them, or over expect something about this case... bottom line... IMO, this is a strong case. Yes the over protection does change the nature of how my touch screen works on the Note II as well as the general hand and finger operation of the phone itself. The tactical feel of the screen is different (after all there is another layer of plastic on top- why would I expect it to be the same?). The important point here, is that this tick heavy case has a purpose in that when the need calls for layers of protection- this is the case to have at hand!.The case fit is very good- and for a big phone like the Samsung Galaxy Note II... that's a selling point all to itself as other case manufactures try to make their cases just a bit bigger to try to fit this phone. The only ding I would give this case is difficulty at times getting it apart either to mount the phone in the case or to remove it... it does indeed take a few minutes to get the phone in or out the Otter :) But, that's not really a major ding.So, why not a 5-star? Well, it has to do with (and keep in mind... THIS IS MY OPINION...) the ports around the phone that are not really covered... Now, I'm not expecting water-proof... water-tight... completely sealed from the atmo case here... nope, not at all (there are other cases for the deep under-sea dive). But, lets talk dust and lint particles... the areas around the case that are open to the outside, as I count them, there are five... the two microphone ports- top and bottom, camera lens and flash, stylus port, and the rear speaker port. Now I understand the design need to make these ports uncovered, of course. The ding is not about that, but rather that the openings in the case are recessed to the point that I suspect long term the phone being in this case you would see the crud collect in these areas. That's not what I would expect for a case that states to be ""particle"" and ""dust"" resistant... these recessed holes are weak  points in that effort. I'm sure that with regular phone un-mounting and cleaning you could manage the ""crud"" from collecting in these port caverns, it's something to be aware of - as you mis-treat your phone in less than clean environments.So, that's what I know...",4.0,1374624000,"07 24, 2013",OtterBox Defender Series Case and Holster for Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - Black,33.73,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Pe3DM6GIL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3100},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

For this note 2, my pocket is suffering as it's too big, that's why I want it on my belt, hence the defender case.The good:protects the phone really well.feels grippier than commuter case.nice lookingeasy access to all ports and buttonsThe bad:built in screen protector is not as bad as many other reviews stated, but not really a good design. The home button is exposed and that hole is going to let dust in, and it is annoying!!!the bulk this case adds to the phone is massive, doubled the weight and thickness...but for the protection, I am ok with it.A lot of people suggest that taking the built-in protector off is a good idea, I'll try if it gets in the way of typing, or if the dust annoys me too much. I have a stand alone screen protector on the phone itself, s pen and typing are not interfered so far.UPDATEOK, after 2 days with the built-in screen protector, I am annoyed by the dust collected through the home button cut-out, i removed the protector by heating it up a little with a hair dryer. be careful since the thin piece may be damaged if you removed it by force.it feels much better now!!!If otterbox could get rid of that home button hole on the built-in screen protector, this is going to be a 5 star product.",4.0,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",OtterBox Defender Series Case and Holster for Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - Black,33.73,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Pe3DM6GIL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3100},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B00A21L2WM,A1S8GWMGUFO6SE,Gregory V. Welch,"[1, 1]","I have had this case for roughly one month.The Pros:It's sturdy, durable and very tough (already dropped the phone twice with absolutely no damage to the device or case)The case does make the phone SLIGHTLY bigger. Not by much though. It does a great job at leaving as much of the front of the phone as open as possible while still keeping a tight grip on the device. The opening for the S Pen is big enough to slip it right out with no problem. (Other cases had a very small opening not much bigger than the S Pen itself making it difficult to get it out). The belt case is very large so it can accommodate the phone which for me is no problem however, I can see it might be a problem for some people. Belt clip doubles as a viewing stand. Awesome. There is a hole in the case on the back of the phone for the phone's built in speaker. This case does NOT hinder the sound quality coming from the phone in any way shape or form.The Cons:This case like all other ones made of rubber synthetic material does collect dust over time in between the case and the phone itself. The outer rubber housing of the case comes off easily and without difficulty however, the inner hard plastic layer that actually come into contact with the phone holds on for dear life to the device as if it was never meant to come off. This is a good thing until you try to take it apart to clean the dirt/dust out of the inside of the case. Takes some time but it does come off as long as you are careful. The built in screen protector is for lack of a better word GARBAGE. The phone has a lot of trouble picking up where the S Pen is over the screen and when browsing the web with the S Pen the phone can't always tell what you have touched. This is probably because the built in screen protector doesn't actually touch the screen. Instead it kind of hovers over it giving you a rebound when you touch it with your fingers. BUT there is good news on the horizon. The built in screen protector comes out. You can then use your own screen protector with this case.Now for some important info. I am not one to drop my phone. I can't afford another one if I break it hence me buying this case. I have dropped my Note 2 TWICE and both times were when I was trying to slip the phone into the belt clip without directly looking at it. My brain told me the phone was in the belt clip and it wasn't and slipped out when I let got of it with my hand. You'll hear a very distinct clicking noise when it snaps into the belt clip. Just make sure it's in the belt clip before you take offOver all this is a GREAT case for the Note 2. I highly recommend it. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because of the crap built in screen protector, Well played Otterbox, Well played indeed",4.0,1361836800,"02 26, 2013",OtterBox Defender Series Case and Holster for Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - Black,33.73,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Pe3DM6GIL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3100},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

I just purchased a note 2 and automatically went with this case. I was really surprised how good it fit the phone and didn't add bulk to it. I really love the grip it gives that slippery thing. Makes 1 handed operation much easier for me.  The screen cover is as if its not there with no noticeable operational differences with the case on or off. I think they did a very good job with the design and I am happy with it. I am a fan of their products and have about 10 of their cases in different sizes and only had 2 small issues that were handled very quick by them.

B00A21L2WM,A1PM3ZL9ZT5PMG,JKS in Boston,"[1, 1]","After reading many reviews on the OtterBox cases, I initially ordered an OtterBox Commuter because a lot people were complaining about the Defender's added bulk and the screen protector getting dusty.The OtterBox Commuter is an excellent case, no question about it. But for me, there was one problem: the Galaxy Note 2 in an OtterBox Commuter is still too big to fit comfortably in your pocket. In fact, you're going to eventually wear a hole in most pants if you keep your Galaxy Note 2 Commuter in your pocket all day (the corners of the case rub and stretch the fabric when you're sitting down, and digging the phone in and out of your pocket all day puts stress on the pocket seams as well).So I ordered an OtterBox Defender to try out. Having used both, I prefer the OtterBox Defender over the Commuter. The Defender's outer shell has a nicer grip that feels better and more secure in your hand. The built-in screen protector has not been an issue (I was worried about it after reading some other people's reviews, but so far I have no complaints about dust or its usability). And the Defender's belt clip allows you to wear the phone on your belt instead of in your pocket. Granted, phone belt clips are not ideal but it's better than ruining your expensive dress work pants. Also, the Defender belt clip is very high quality and it positions the phone flat against your side so it's not that bad looking.In terms of added bulk, the Defender is really not much larger than the Commuter (certainly less of a difference than I was expecting).Finally, the Defender does offer more rugged protection than the Commuter - although the Commuter is probably more than adequate protection for most normal situations.Overall, I really like the OtterBox Defender case and am very happy with it.",5.0,1360195200,"02 7, 2013",OtterBox Defender Series Case and Holster for Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - Black,33.73,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Pe3DM6GIL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3100},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B00A21L2WM,A22RS9XNLGIRSF,Michael St James,"[0, 1]","I've had OtterBox Defender cases for my last three Smartphones, and I am a fan.  However, I am slightly disappointed in this latest case for my new Galaxy Note 2.The fact that the GN2 has a hardware HOME button and softkeys for BACK and MENU on either side requires that the transparent screen protector portion of this case be die-cut to allow for operation of the HOME key. Unfortunately, this die-cut opening is an entry point for dust and debris.  I am not a fan of these built-in protectors anyway; they reduce both screen fidelity and sensitivity, finger motions drag on this surface, and they smudge much more readily than a bare screen, even more readily than high-quality adhesive protectors. I used the case for the first few days with the screen protector in place to see if my previous complaints were no longer valid, and found that I couldn't WAIT to get rid of it on this case. It's easy to remove, but OtterBox may void your warranty if you do it. It's attached to the top part of the case with a fine bead of the stretchy sort of adhesive that you can roll up if any remains in place on the top part of the case. In my experience, it separated cleanly with all of the adhesive remaining attached to the clear protector. You carefully apply increasing pressure at one point on the edge of the protector until it begins to pull away from the rest of the case, and then work it around the entire edge until it falls free. I understand that in an industrial environment, the reduced screen fidelity, additional surface glare, and reduced sensitivity might be an acceptable trade-off for the protection. For me, that's not the case, so I removed it.Removing the screen protector left me with two more minor complaints. The rubber exterior sleeve that pulls on over the hard interior parts of the case is quite hard. When I broke the last belt clip on my previous phone, I purchased a Seidio Active case for it, and I much prefer that slightly softer, tackier rubber material to this harder OtterBox material. I'm sure that this OtterBox material is very durable, and the fit (openings) for camera, stylus, speaker and ports is perfect, but this harder material slides more easily on smooth surfaces...it's just not as grippy in the hand, either. Also, it is a stiffer material, making the right-side activation button and the left-side volume buttons quite difficult to press. Getting them to detent actually makes the case creak a little where the two halves are joined.All that said, this is a tough, high-quality case that will take a great deal of punishment. It does add bulk, but I actually like that. On a phone as large as the GN2, a little extra thickness is no big deal. Taking care to protect the Gorilla Glass screen, I'm confident that the rest of the phone is very well protected by the Defender case. I would have given 3.5 stars if I could have.",3.0,1363478400,"03 17, 2013",OtterBox Defender Series Case and Holster for Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - Black,33.73,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Pe3DM6GIL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3100},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

I am in the military so I go through alot of terrian especially rucking through thick forest so I didnt feel comfortable using the clip of my waist for fear of a branch silently taking the phone without me noticing. This lead to me keeping the phone in my pocket and because of the very grippy outside layer it was unbelievabley difficult to take the phone out of my pocket quick and easy also leading to the gummy layer no longer tightly hugging the case. the screen protector the comes with this case was ok at first but as time went on the case started becoming lose around the lock in areas. So the plastic screen protector started causing bubbles making it difficult for me to see what was on the screen so I peeled it off and put on an actual screen protector. Lastly taking the case apart to get to the actual phone was stupid difficult you nearly had to break the lock in braces to release it and after the 4th time of me doing I did break some of the lock im braces.

I like the protection of this case, makes me not worry so much about dropping the phone. I did purchase a Spigen SGP ultra clear screen protector. I am seriously considering removing the built-in screen protector and applying the Spigen. Zagg HD is also a great option if you can deal with its wet installation technique and the possible bubbles. You would think that Otterbox would address the numerous complaints that users have about the Defender built-in screen protector. Read all the negative reviews about so many people removing this ill-fitting thing and applying their own screen protection.  Maybe you should remove this annoying garbage from your Defender cases and include a excellent separate screen protector. Are you listening OTTERBOX? I don't think so, because you always include the same built-in garbage. I have been removing these things from other Defender cases like the one I had for my Droid Razr.  The thing is I don't like having to pay so much money for a case and then have to proceed to rip it apart. The case protection the Otterbox Defender gives is unbeatable. The built-in screen protector should be scratched completely from the design of this case. Then, OTTERBOX, include a decent separate screen protector and keep your high price point or no screen protector and lower your price. I highly recommend this case, but I am sick and tired of the annoyance and necessary modding of the built-in screen protector.

As expected with any Otterbox, it's a snug all around great fit, and although some I've seen, have issues with the power or volume buttons being hard to depress after the case is fully installed, I have not experienced this problem. There was no bunching or bulging in any areas, and the entire outer casing fit smoothly.The thickness added by the case is about 1&#34;, maybe a tiny bit less, but that's to be expected with an Otterbox. The covers for the charging and headphone ports are a little stiff to open and replace but again, not a very big issue. I would rather them be stiff and prevent debris from entering than not.

Everytime  i get a new phone, i make sure i buy a new case to cover it and keep it safe. I work a job that requires a lot of physical labour and i'm always bumping into things, dropping my phone on hard surfaces. It doesn't help that i'm an inherently klutzy person. I wear Khaki's with huge pockets, so i never use the holster. But it does bulk your phone up quite a bit, i'm a big man so i've got big hands. It might make an already large phone even harder to deal with for those with smaller hands. If you're not incredibly klutzy or do alot of physical work where it may get bumped, i'd suggest a smaller case. To me, it's worth the size to protect this expensive phone. I don't believe in contracts, so i paid for my phone full price and outright.It comes in two layers. First, a hard cover is snapped over the phone where the phone fits snuggly. then a rubber covering is placed over the hard cover to protect the back of the phone and more importantly, the corners.Pros:- Protects the phone, very, very well.- Scratch protector prevents scratches effectively.- Has built-in coverings for the ports, Mini-USB and the earphone jack. providing tons of extra protection for your phone yet providing easy access.- Will probably save you 100's down the the road when you want to resell it for a new one and protects it so that you don't break it prematurely.- Doesn't effect vioce quality, sound quality or the ability to use the flash or camera. There is an opening for the stylus pen, that makes it easily accessible but provides extraordinary protection for it.Cons:- The screen covering, the one that provides protection from scratches, is loose. so there is a small but noticable space between the screen protector and the screen. This may annoy some. I've learned to ignore it. Though it can be removed if necessary with steam if a really irritant.- increases the size of the phone dramatically, which may make it unwieldy to many users. more so than it already is.- There is a hole for the home button. Dirt, grime and dust likes to be sucked through this hole into the small space between the screen protector and the screen. making frequent cleaning a necessity. It appears to me that pushing on the rubber-like screen protector with that hole there seems to create a suction that forces tons of junk into that small area over a period of time.Overall:Great, worth the price with a long-term pay off.

B00A21L33K,AXPAIEE0732A9,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","Ok I bought this case because the screen is expensive to replace on this phone and the skin case I was using didn't offer enough protection.  The Defender case was too big so I ordered this one instead.  Also, I don't like the gel exterior of the Defender case, this one has a plastic exterior that should feel better going in and out of my pocket.  I was also excited that this case came with a screen protector.So here is my opinion.  The gel rubber interior part of this case is much harder than I was expecting.  The plastic outer skin looks and feels very cheap.  Also the outer plastic shell is super super slippery.  My last case was plastic, but it still had some grip to it, not enough to resist going into my pocket though.  This case is super slippery.  The plastic shell and the inner layers don't really fit together perfectly, its just a thing I notice, no one else probably would.  Also, this case is MASSIVE!  It is basically the same size as the Defender case, its about 2-2.5 times thicker than the phone, you can definitely see it bulging in your pocket.  My old case was slim and you could not see it in my pocket clearly.  It doesn't seem to really protect the ports.  This case has annoying covers that protect the ports, however water or debris can easily get to the ports through the lip on the screen.  Up by the headphone jack, the lip actually is cut away allowing even more to get by and into the port area.  I'm not sure why it is designed that way.  The top and bottom mic, S-Pen area, camera & flash have absolutely no liquid protection.  However they are set deep within the case to they are safe from falls.  The rubber push button parts build into the rubber are nice and feel good and responsive when you press them.  Also randomly, my phone's speaker seems to be much louder in this case over my last case, and both had cut outs???  This case is in no way attractive, it seems to look a little worse in real life than the pics of it look, IMHO.I understand that this case offers superior fall protection, and that is thanks partly to its bulk.  However... This is not a Defender case, in my opinion this one should be designed to be more slim and pocket-able.  Whatever.  And the exterior plastic shell just feels cheap in your hands.I love the plastic screen protector that came with the case.  Its fits perfectly and was super easy to install.  I bought a invisibleSHIELD screen cover recently and immediately hated it, and returned it.  This one is great!  I got a couple small fibers stuck to it, but its my fault.  It feels nice to the finger too, and I hate screen protectors as a rule, but this is alright.  This case feels very solid.  The Defender case for the iPhone 4/4s has that crappy outer later they isn't really connected and feels like trash, gets torn up... This case is solid and does not have any silly loose layer or anything.  The covers for the headphone port and charging port were difficult to open at first, but now they are easier, and I like how they feel.If you need uber protection then I recommend this case or the defender case.  If you hate the feel of a rubber cover going in and out of your pocket then get this case.  However, if you want something less bulky look elsewhere.

Ive always been the &#34;style&#34; kind of guy so for all my previous phones, id get a super slim cover. Those are great looking but dont offer drop protection. only scratch protection. When looking for a case for my beloved note 2 that i paid full retail price on, i wanted something more than just scratch protection. There are PLENTY of unique flip cases out there and i really wanted to buy one of them to add some style, and some protection. But knowing the fact that my phone would most likely break from a drop just wasn't reassuring to me. So i turned to Otterbox, the most well known brand when it comes to serious protection. I wear pretty slim jeans (the skinniest a man can go without feeling uncomfortable/skin tight). So i knew an otterbox defender wouldnt fit and im not much of a holster fan. Hoping that this case would fit my pockets, i decided to dish out some cash and buy it.Pros:-IT FITS IN MY POCKET!!!!!-It actually feels great to hold onto and gives my phone a rugged appearance-Unlike the Defender, the Commuter is made of an inside rubber and outer plastic shell. this is great for all the people  who want to slide their phones in and out of their pocket with ease.-There are flaps that cover the 3.5mm headphone jack and the charging port so no dust can get inside.-There is a nice even lip so that if the phone dropped face down, the screen would not make contact with the floor.-UNLIKE the Defender case, there are no problems pressing the volume buttons! (i was really scared that the buttons would feel mushy because many people with the Defender series were complaning of that issue.)-it comes with a screen protector (i havent got to test out how clear it is. Will update if i decide to install it)-Gives me peace of mind.Cons:-Make more colors! (although i love the black color on my grey Note 2)-Although the flaps covering the headphone and charging ports offer great dust protection, it makes it slightly less accessible. it takes me a couple extra seconds to insert the charging cable, however, its definitely a worthy tradeoff.-Does add thickness, bulk, and weight, but all these are tradeoffs for protection.Conclusion:There is absolutely nothing i could change about this case. It does exactly what its suppose to do: offer the maximum amount of protection that will still fit in your pockets (unless you wear skin tight jeans).This is for the people who want true drop protection.",5.0,1356307200,"12 24, 2012",OtterBox Commuter Series Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - Black,24.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Gdg6zfHtL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 5690},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies']]"

These aren't huge issues for me, but I can imagine how dusty the phone will get after some time in my pockets. Another minor issue is the amount of pressure needed to press buttons covered by the case, but I expected this due to the amount of protection this case provides.

B00A21L33K,A3J0LOCVOIEDNE,High Roller,"[0, 0]","I had previously been using the OEM Samsung hard case for my Note 2. It was a very good case that was sleek/stylish however it lacked any real drop protection. I picked the Commuter since the Defender would be way too much overkill. That, plus the built in screen protector on the Defender has always been an issue. The Commuter is a nice balance between looks and functionality. While it does add some bulk to the already large phone, it's worth it IMO. With this case you get added protection from drops/bumps, increased front protection in case you drop the phone screen first as well as ports to cover the charge/headphone plugs.The plastic back cover is a little slippery but it's nothing too bad. I'd prefer a little more grip with that but it works fine as is. Only other concern is that since the back cover is plastic, it doesn't grip well if you lay it on an inclined surface. It'll slide around alot if you're not careful. All the ports are easily accessible however the only issue I've come across is with the headphone plug cover. If your earbuds/headphones have a large 3.5 plug, it may not fit properly with the cover that hides the port. Most of my headphones work fine however a couple won't fit due to the tight squeeze of the plug cover.Overall, really like this case and feel a little more comfortable should my phone get dropped or whatever.

However, now I understand why the YouTube videos demonstrating the case don't include a demonstration of the screen saver.  The most serious flaw is that the screen cover came with a piece of tape marking the back side and the front side.  The back side tape came off cleanly, but the tape on the front side tape left a thick, goo area on the screen.  Another problem is that the screen cover doesn't come with a scraper to help put it on, and a credit card just isn't strong enough to put it on without bubbles.Other than the tape issue (which is serious) I must say that I am surprised by how much the screen saver improves the touch screen.  Before I put on the screen saver I thought that the Note 2 screen was too sensitive; I often had extra taps register, and sometimes the screen reacted before I actually touched it.  It wasn't very good for games for that reason.  I also didn't like the S-Pen.  It actually magnified the excessively touchy screen problems.  The was also the unpleasant feeling of writing on glass with plastic.  The screen saver made all of the difference.  It throttled down the hyper-sensitive screen, and the surface provides a very nice writing surface for the pen.  I don't keep leaving stray marks on the S-Note app.  I have left the screen saver on despite the glue spot because it greatly improves the operation of the phone.EDIT:  I wrote Otterbox about the screen issue.  They wanted photographs.  I sent in the pictures and they shipped me a new DEFENDER case.  It was interesting being able to compare the commuter and the defender cases.  Honestly, I like the commuter case better.  The defender has a rigid screen protector, and there is just a tiny gap between the screen and the phone in some places.  That gives an unpleasant bit of give in some areas of the screen, especially when using the stylus.  The holster on the defender case looks secure, but it popped off my belts too many times for me to feel comfortable carrying it on my belt in the holster.  Also, the defender case has rectangular attachment points for the holster right below the sound and power buttons.  The commuter case doesn't have the attachment points, and I found it much easier to orient right side up in my hand just by feel; the attachment points make that quite a bit harder with the defender case.  Since the holster for the defender case is now in a drawer there is only a slightly greater amount of drop protection with my defender case.  I am actually considering trying out a third-party screen protector and going back to using my commuter case.

My phone is my office and contains more valuable tools and information than any of my other possessions so no protection is too much for it.  People comment on this all the time about how big and bulky it looks.  I&#8217;m fine with that because I&#8217;ll choose function over form every time.Compared to other extreme cases this does the job:  waterproof seals and a hard shell that protects the device against scratches and drops.  However the waterproof function does not support use of headphones and you must remember to seal the headphone and docking ports while in transit.  Some people complained I sounded a bit hard to hear with this case and adjusting those port seals sometimes helped.  Competitors have adapters for the headphone jack which is a blessing and curse.  I like Otterbox&#8217;s approach because there is less to lose and I&#8217;m rarely worried about listening to the music waterproof (got Bluetooth for that).  All switches are easily accessible except for the fingerprint sensor on the 5s.The killer feature of this case is the ease of removal.

I had several gripes with this case, the first being the screen protector. It sits too far above the screen and affects the touch sensitivity, plus with the small screen cutout, keeps you from being able to touch the edges of the screen. The port plugs are hard to install and remove, plus I can see the o-rings wearing out prematurely with normal use. Also, the case will NOT keep out dust if any of the plugs are out! I was mowing the grass and had headphones plugged in with the phone in my pocket. When I was done I had to take the case apart and clean all the dust and small grass pieces from between the screen and screen protector. I never had this problem with my defender case! My major gripe about the case is the size of the opening for the lightning connector. If you use anything other than the cord that apple gave you, it won't fit. I charge my phone on a nightstand with a 6' RND cord and have an Amazon basics cord in my car, neither of these will plug in with the phone in this case. I also had an issue with the case messing up the phone's tilt sensor, which turns off the screen when you hold the phone up to your ear. The phone would constantly go on speakerphone or mute while I was talking. Out of this case or in my Defender case, that feature works fine.

I started carrying my wallet in a ziplock so the dust (mostly silica) wouldn't ruin my cards.  My defender case wasn't keeping out the dust and I worried about the health of my iPhone, so I took a chance on this case, and I am happy to say that it does what it is supposed to.  Not only is it totally waterproof (I tested it for 30 minutes as the instructions indicate without the phone inside), but it keeps the very fine dust away from my phone completely.  Yes, it is bulky, but it's only slightly larger than the defender and much easier to get on and off.  No multiple layers.  Open the box, insert phone, close box, latch.  Just that simple.  As for sound quality, I was expecting worse with a waterproof case (the others I've seen required Bluetooth) and I find it totally acceptable, and I use Bluetooth often, at work and while driving.

So those the complained about the sound had the older version of this and it was indeed a problem.Now to the good stuff:I know, you got this great phone and you want to keep it new while working outside... How do I ensure my beautiful phone will still work when I work in construction, electrical, etc?  The answer is this case...I wanted to know if the claims about this device were true so I put it through its paces.  I submerged it, I buried it, I drove over it (with my small light car) and I finally put my phone in it and used it.Pros:I can't think of another case that protects as well for so many different items than this case does.  It's very good at protection.It is waterproof (I have no idea how deep, but for accidentally dropping it in a puddle or answering your phone by the pool, it works great), it's sturdy (if you dropped it in said puddle and someone ran over it, chances are it's perfectly fine) and nothing gets through the case.Cons: These are somewhat picky (after all, with all that protection, there has to be some trade off), but work noting.The sound is reduced (but surprisingly clear) by this case and don't count on the noise cancellation to help much when talking.  The case is also quite bulky and roughly doubles the size of your iPhone 5.  Also, the screen cover is notoriously difficult to keep clean and the really picky one is that since the ports are all covered, getting any charging cable through the hole besides the Apple one, probably isn't going to happen.Overall, I am impressed with this case.

I personally couldn't imagine using this sort of case all the time as I find it too bulky and uncomfortable to hold/access but for those times when your phone might be subjected to extreme conditions I think it's an excellent accessory to own.Upon opening it and reviewing the paperwork the first thing you'll see is that they recommend testing it in water for a full 30mins before placing your device inside, anyone who just tosses their phone in here and throws it in water is insane in my opinion. I filled up a large bowl with water, put a folded paper towel into the case, sealed it back up, and submerged it into the bowl (weighing it down so it was fully under the water) I waited about 1/2 an hour and then dried it completely, opened it and was very happy to see my napkin was dry and there wasn't a drop of water in the case. Now I personally never intend to submerge my phone whether its in this case or not, but I'm happy to see that if it was, and fell into some water I wouldn't need to worry. I also dropped the case several times on both carpet, tile, and cement flooring and it appeared perfectly fine. I repeated the water test after these drops and still bone dry inside. So I'm also confident that if my phone fell out of my pocket while I was out about about it would survive.All this said I'm confident this is a great case for trips to the beach, when we go roller blading or bike riding, or any other situation where I wouldn't trust my flimsy day to day case to actually protect my phone, heck I might even use it when taking a bubblebath so I can watch a show on my iphone w/o worrying about it slipping and falling in.One thing to note for the ladies, I see lots of comments about how fast & easy it is to get your phone in/out of this case... I wouldn't say that is untrue but you will need to use your thumb nail to release the hinges, and I felt like mine might break if I wasn't really careful.",5.0,1393459200,"02 27, 2014",OtterBox Armor Series Waterproof Case for iPhone 5 - Retail Packaging - Orange,26.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31zgulueNZL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 799},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Waterproof Cases']]"

B00B59NKRK,AIXTKOGCVXQUH,John Rawlins,"[116, 141]","Hi,I've had this case for about a week now and I'm pleased with it.  Over the years I've had a lot of cases for my iPhones (Otterbox Commuter, Otterbox Defender, H20 Audio, Pelican, Amphibian, Speck, PowerMat, and many more).  It's occurred to me that cases are like jackets. There is no single one that's great for everything.  This case reminds me of my North Face Double-X Parka down jacket.  The Double-X is bulky, not particularly stylish (unless maybe you're a gear-head) and hard to get into the pockets but under harsh conditions it is exactly what you want.  The Armor case is pretty much the same story.I would generally not recommend this case for an every day walking around case.  However judging it against the other waterproof cases I've tried it is the best.  Below are some additional notes for you.Pro's:- Construction is good quality.  I was disappointed in the Otterbox Commuter and Defender cases for the iPhone 4.  The iPhone 3 models were much better.  This Armor case is better than the Otterbox iPhone 4 cases.- It's not a bitch to get the phone in and out of the case.  You just open the latches and pop it in and out.  This is important since I don't want to use the Armor all the time.  With the H20 Audio case I literally worried about breaking the phone in half every time I used it.  The Amphibian case was a lot more trouble too.- All the controls are accessible.  This is not true with the Pelican or H20 Audio.  It's not as easy to access them as a typical everyday case but it is possible.- For a waterproof case it's actually not too bulky.  The other three I've used have all been as large or larger.Cons:- Price.  This baby is expensive- Weight.  The Amphibian case for my iPhone 4 is considerably lighter.- The sound quality is a bit muffled/muted but it's usable.  Headphones or a Blu-tooth are good options when making a lot of phone calls.So if you're climbing Mt. Hood consider the Armor case, and a perhaps a Double-X Parka too. ;)Best regards,John",4.0,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",OtterBox Armor Series Waterproof Case for iPhone 5 - Retail Packaging - Orange,26.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31zgulueNZL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 799},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Waterproof Cases']]"

B00B59NKRK,A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH,"Narut Ujnat ""Enthusiasm is contagious.""","[0, 0]","Otterbox does make some excellent phone covers.  And, I have purchased more than a few covers before and I always Otterbox was of very good quality.This box is certainly NOT the Otterbox commuter!1.  What's in the box?:  You receive (in an impressive box) the cover.  Also, there are brief instructions and, buried inside the bottom plastic wrapping, is a lanyard.2.  Aesthetic:?  I received the Neon Armor cover.  First off, this thing is built like a tank.  I would not say that this cover is built for the looks, as this is a form for function item.  You will let everyone know you have a phone in a tough cover with this thing.3.  Use:?  It was quite easy to place the phone in the cover.  First, you simply unsnap the hinges and this cover will separate into two pieces.  You simply place the phone inside, and snap the cover closed.  That's it.Did I mention this thing is built like a tank?  A plastic insert informs you that this is built to US military standard.  And I believe it because there is a lot of plastic material here.  Dropping the phone (not with my phone inside during tests by they way as I am not willing to do this) clearly causes no issues as the plastic is robust.  The phone is also waterproof according to the specs.  I have tried putting this in water and not seen any leakage so it appears to be waterproof.  However, while the cover is incredibly robust, the seemingly weak plastic cover on the front.  While these is a lip around the front cover, it sure seems like a weak link.  I recommend not throwing out the plastic insert as this will protect the inside of the phone if the phone is not inside.  It sure seems that the cover could be breached in water.  So, as for this item being waterproof, this would NOT be my primary motivation in purchasing the item as this would protect the item from a drop but not being submerged (in my opinion).  This is an important point to consider.  Otherwise, this cover is fantastic for its purpose which is a fairly indestructible cover and an ability not to be easily damaged.Use of phone?:  Okay, this is not the cover to purchase if you expect to have long detailed conversations with people!  While the cover allows the touchscreen to be used easily (and that are naturally buttons for the home function and volume and ringer), talking on the phone is a mediocre experience.  I would think using Bluetooth devices would be a better approach, but then again this is a protection cover for the phoneOne quibble:  On the bottom are two removable tabs for headphones.  These have some nice seals and do not seem to breach the waterproof aspect (the front cover is my main concern).  However, be aware that while the headphone jack is not an issue, the average lightning power jack may not easily fit inside the cover to allow a charge.Overall:  This is not a cover I would use for everyday use as this is far more robust that I would require.  But for those workers and people who need a great phone, but are conscious of needing a robust cover than this is a great choice. I would caution a buyer somewhat on the waterproof issue (seems fine but I wouldn't go out of my way to put this in water and dropping it off a boat and letting it float for a while seems risky (but heck electronics and saltwater don't mix anyway - just ask the Navy).  While I did not test the cover with my phone inside during crush tests and drops, the cover is really tough and it will protect the phone.  Going swimming is probably not a great idea.

No, it's not particularly pretty, but it does meet US Military Standards for protection against water, dust, accidental drops and crush protection.I usually use theOtterBox Defender Series Case and Holster for iPhone 4/4S - Frustration-Free Packaging - Blackand have been very pleased with the protection it has provided.  I've dropped my phone a few times and thanks to OtterBox, no damage done.  The OtterBox Armor Series was always out of my price range, but when I saw it so heavily discounted (only paid twenty-five for it...)  I decided the additional protection it offered was worth considering.INSTALLATION:This case is easier to put on your iPhone 4/4S than the Defender two part method.  Once you release the two metal clamps on the side of the case, you can easily slip your phone into the case and reverse the process to secure it.  Port covers waterproof the phone when in place, but they have to be secured for this to be so!PROTECTION:From Water - down to 6.6' for 2 minutes and 30 seconds.  That's enough time to fish it out of the toilet or a koi pond, but you won't want to take your phone scuba diving!From Drops - up to 10'.  This case provides excellent protection from drops out of your jacket pocket or car, but you won't want to toss it from the roof of your second story house.From Dust - provides a dust-free environment for your phone.  If it's clean when it goes in the case, it'll be clean when it comes out!From Crush - this case is designed to withstand your vehicle running over it with your phone inside, assuming your vehicle is under 2 tons.SUGGESTIONS Per OtterBox Insert:+ Test your case in water for 30 seconds prior to installing your phone.+ Inspect case after every impact to ensure protective properties are not compromised.  (Always good advice.)+ If you remove your phone, check the inner seal for dust or debris prior to re-installing to ensure protection.Overall, the 4-layer protection offered by the OtterBox Armor Series is superior to any other I've found.  It can be charged in the case using a standard 30-pin cable and the on/off and volume buttons work well.However, it's bulky, and call volume on my end suffers when in this case.  The ringer on/off button is very stiff and difficult to maneuver.  The built-in screen protector sometimes negatively affects the touchscreen responsiveness.In my opinion, no case is perfect in terms of style and function.

B00B59NKRU,A1Y2ES3X1M0Q3T,Too-Tall,"[72, 74]","OK, so i wanted to get this case for my 4s for the longest time. After all the negativity on here i decided against it. then i regretted that, bought it in a local store for full retail and wish i had NOT listened to the people on here. I upgraded from a Defender series case. i have NEVER used my phone without an otterbox... EVER.Here's some facts from a normal person. I use my phone as a (shocker) PHONE. I also use it for mapping, weather, Facebook, and gaming. Occasionally i will watch a youtube video on it, sometimes i will use it to show someone an awesome song. I have done all of these things since i got this case and here are the facts:Calls - I have made and received calls using just the handset and people i spoke with had no clue i had a case on my phone. I was able to hear the conversation with no problem whatsoever.Gaming - I have had no loss of functionality anywhere on the screen. Anywhere i touch for my game reacts the same as if the case wasn't thereMusic/Videos - Is there some sound loss? yes. Is it &#34;omfg horrible!&#34; no. If you are using your phone as a portal music device with no external speakers, i submit there is something wrong with you to begin with. But lets not go there. If you are using your phone for the occasional youtube video now and again or listening to a song to show a friend then listen up. 1) pop the plug cover off the bottom, the sound returns to normal. don't complain &#34;then its not waterproof anymore&#34; why are you listening to music in wet conditions anyway? WHY?! If you are a sane person, go indoors, pop the cover open and you have full sound again. However even with the cover on, i was able to hear my wife watching a video i showed her on facebook, from 3 ROOMS AWAY (vol max) So showing someone a nifty new song or video, and you require super max volume, then yes pop the cover on the bottom. otherwise the sound volume will be reduced by about 30%.Ringtone, while in an area with loud ambiance (like in the cab of a tractor trailer, traveling down the highway) you are going to miss calls... UNLESS you also have vibrate on then you will be fine. Truth be told i couldn't hear the damn thing even before this case. However if you spend most of your time at home or in quieter situations like the office or what have you. you wont noticed a problem at all.  Furthermore i submit some of these reviewers require a dictionary, as the sound &#34;quality&#34; is NOT reduced. the sound &#34;volume&#34; is. so your music and videos sound just fine only slightly quieter.Pros:-Dust Proof? YES this was tested to the extreme recently when several pounds of cement dust poured onto my pant leg and subsequently my phone. the case kept it all out, and was easy to clean-Water Proof? i have not thrown my phone into a bucket of water or went surfing with it (seriously, scroll through the reviews, some dingbat went surfing with their phone); However i am 100% confident that in a rainstorm if i had to make a call with it, or if i was splashed with water in the pocket i carry it in, i wouldn't worry.-Crush Proof? I have leaned on it, laid on it, and various forms of putting pressure on it while at work (my job can be rough some days) and at 350lbs, i can assure you this case did not give. would i run it over with my car? why on earth would i do that?-Drop proof? my defender survived multiple bounces (in one drop) and falls from up to 8 feet; i feel confident this will too.-Normal Everyday use (by which i mean, you use it normally) while protecting against a beating of external forces, absolutely.-Easy to remove. In the event you wanted to use a dock, or other phone accessory temporarily (ie: the iphone mount for nerf guns; or a docking station for a party) the phone can be removed by unclasping the 2 clasps that are there, and removing the back. its just that simple.Cons:-Sound Volume? It is reduced by roughly 25-30% Why? because to be water/dust proof the phone must be completely 100% encased. Between thin layers of plastic and thick outer layers to defend against shocks, drops, spills, and thrills, this phone is 100% protected from anything but bullets and explosions.-Buttons. Home button is no issue. Volume + - take a little more pressure to activate; and admittedly the Silent Mode switch on the side is &#34;troublesome&#34; or more accurately takes a little effort to work. But to me that's a small price to pay for a water/dust proof phone.-Carry. While the defender comes with a nice belt case, this one requires an additional $20 purchase to get a belt case for it. Out of the box it is strictly a case. However in recent months i have been carrying my phone in a pocket anyway, so this transition was flawless when i got this one. It fits in a standard (t-shirt) pocket, Pants pocket, or even an AR mag pouch (my tactical pants have magazine pockets in them) snugly and securely.So all in all this is a case that every iPhone 4/4s or 5/5s (different case) should be in. While there is a couple cons, the average person will have no issue at all with a case like this. if you are using your phone as a radio all the time, then get an external speaker or headphones if its that big of a deal to you.",5.0,1388620800,"01 2, 2014",OtterBox Armor Series Waterproof Case for iPhone 4/4S - Retail Packaging - Neon,39.98,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31oPdmR4cXL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 640},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Waterproof Cases']]"

B00B9OTEVM,A35SM57R1CRSHA,Dean Buzzell,"[10, 16]","After my first S3 went through the wash cycle, finding a decent waterproof case has been something of a quest. I've tried several; some were promising, but had fatal flaws, while others were just downright stupid concepts.I had really high hopes for this case; Otterbox makes really good cases, and I felt sure they'd knock it outta the park with this case. While it does have some good features that I liked, it also has some flaws. One flaw in particular is fatal flaw, and for that one, I'm returning the product.Pros:It IS waterproof - I kept it submerged for over an hour in my bathroom sink, and the inside stayed dry.The case is surprisingly easy to open and close back up - I REALLY liked that.Ports are easy to open and close.No 'moisture spots' developed between the inside of the case screen and my device screen. That was HUGE in my book.Exterior speaker worked really well. In fact, was louder than the built-in S3 external speaker.Touchscreen was very sensitive.Cons:The thing is HUGE beyond reasonable.When I latched the case shut, the back piece was 'bowed'. Let me try to explain - the case is in two pieces - the front piece, where the phone lives, and the back plate. The back plate has teeth along one long edge that fit into matching slots in the front piece. Align the teeth and slots, and press the two pieces together. Then use the metal latches to fasten them tight. That's when the 'bowing' shows up - at least it did with my unit. After closing the latches, I'd look at it from the top and bottom edges, and could see that while the two long edges were drawn tightly together, the middle of the back plate was bowed outward, so there appeared to be a gap between the two. The gap apparently didn't leak, but it was an obvious side effect of the latching process that constantly made me nervous.While the external speaker worked well, it is a weak spot. It is made up of a lightweight screen on the exterior of the case, and a rubber-like diaphragm on the inside. The diaphragm vibrates like a speaker cone, and transmits music or telephone conversations really well. My fear is that this could easily be punctured, allowing moisture in that could ruin the device inside.The buttons are STIFF, and required hard presses to get them to work. The Back and Menu softkeys are hard to reach and not responsive. Surprising, since the main touch screen is so sensitive.Telephone - this is where the case really sucks. Be prepared to literally shout to make yourself heard. If you actually intend to listen to the other party, you better put in your headphones. Absolutely the worst thing about this case, and for me was the dealbreaker.The S3 has a proximity sensor feature that turns off your display when you hold the phone to your ear, and turns it back on when you take the phone away. This feature is disabled entirely while the case is on my phone. In fact, I'm not able to disconnect from calls until the other party hangs up. I refuse to start turning off phone features because my case renders them unworkable. At $95 this case better allow my phone features to work correctly.Maybe Otterbox will fix these flaws - another reviewer said he contacted Otterbox customer support who sent him out a new case that fixed the proximity sensor problem. Hopefully one day they'll fix the issue where I can't hear the caller or shout so the caller can hear me while on a phone call.",1.0,1370649600,"06 8, 2013",OtterBox Armor Series Waterproof Case for Samsung Galaxy S III - Retail Packaging - Neon,22.49,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31slNz%2BeaML._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1242},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies']]"

B00B9OTEVM,A3V1AHX8P4R839,"Forrest Wildwood ""Phil""","[0, 1]",OtterBox Armor Series Waterproof Case for the Galaxy SIII will certainly keep the phone dry.  I tested the case by putting some paper inside and closing the case.  Then submerging it in the sink and holding down the case with a lotion bottle.  No bubbles came from the side and after wiping off the outside found the paper inside nice and dry.  Two clips on the case lock the back down tight and make for a nice waterproof environment for the phone.  I haven't checked to see if the phone would overheat but I wouldn't expect this to be a problem.  The case is strong enough to keep the phone from breaking or shattering the screen if dropped under normal conditions.  There probably would still be cases where the phone could still get broken but these would have to be some pretty abnormal areas like dropping it out a car window at 75 mph and running over it.  I'm not going to test that.All this protection comes with a price and these are that the case makes the phone bigger and the buttons require more effort to work with the phone.  Sound quality was good and there is a waterproof cover for the headphone jack and the USB port.  The price seemed a little high until I considered that it is cheaper than what it cost me to replace the screen on my second daughter's phone.

B00B9OTEVM,A2004PKGV568VM,juju,"[176, 184]","Well I'm not going to go over all the good things about this case because it does exactly what it's supposed to...drop, dust, water, crush proof. Only slight problem I noticed is when you're actually on a call. Imma try to explain best I can...for all you with a Galaxy S3 should know what I mean. Ok so normally when you're on a call the phones proximity sensor detects when you have the phone near your ear/face and turns the screen off so you don't accidentally press buttons and what not. But when you take the phone away while still on the call the screen turns on again and you see all the in-call options like speakerphone, etc. Now the reason for 4-star rating. Apparently when the Otterbox Armor case is installed and you get a phone call the sensor activates and turns the screen off immediately whether or not if you have the phone near your ear/face or away. This becomes a problem because first of all, you can't end the call because none of the buttons work, so you have to wait till the other party hangs up. Second of all if u need access stuff like internet, photos, etc while on a call you can't because the screen stays off and the buttons don't work while on call. My first theory which is probably is correct is that the built in screen protector is not flush enough to the sensor and/or since the front of the case makes the sensor recessed it blocks or interferes with the  amount of light the sensor receives. So far I found 3 ways to remedy this: First, take phone calls outside when its daylight cuz outside its bright enough to detect when phones not near your face. Second, use a Bluetooth or headphones during a call, this leaves the screen on, or Third if inside building or home rush to a nearby light or window and put the front of phone close to the light, this will simulate that the phone is away from your face and turn on the screen momentarily then once on, quickly press the speakerphone button then the screen will stay on. So far I haven't reported this issue to Otterbox.com as this is where I ordered my case. I could just have a defective one or this could the issue with all the case, I dunno. I'm just waiting to see if anyone has this problem yet. I took some photos and the digital camera actually picks up the IR sensor light which u can see... it actually stays on even when not on a call. I will post the pics on here.UPDATE::: Ok several hours after posting this and tinkering with some settings on the phone i found the in-call setting to turn off the proximity sensor. This completely resolves the problem. So now when im in call i just tap the power button to off/on the screen manually. No biggie...easy fix to have the ultimate protection of the Armor case :):):) Updated to 5-Star as well. :)5/30 UPDATE: Contacted Otterbox on 5/23 about this issue and as of today i have brand new one just shipped out via FedEx....apparently others have reported this problem too and the replacement fixes this issue.

B00B9OTEVM,A1YEPFLLH42OU1,"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia ""Yu-Jin Chia""","[0, 0]","For those who want to use a smartphone but live in perpetual fear of destroying it, this case is made for you. There's simply nothing that can afford a higher level of durability without making the device unusable. There are actually rugged phones out there, e.g. some of Motorola's IDEN network devices, but they aren't available for all networks and are permanently clunky. Also, those don't help if you already bought a phone and can't (or don't want to) send it back. If you must have a rugged phone, this is about as close as you can get to having your cake and eating it too as far as high-end functionality + durability goes. This case affords excellent protection for the S3, which although no longer the best in class, is still a very capable device.As you can probably tell just by looking at it and reading the specs, this case turns the S3 into a tank. You can drop it, kick it around, dunk it in water, rub it in sand, take a shower with it... it'll not even faze the phone in this case. And yes, I did try doing most of those things. Basically, as long as this case is on you have very little to fear as far as damaging the phone. This does come at a price though- both literally and in terms of usability. Here's the general pros and cons of this product:Pro:As noted, nothing short of a direct hit from a tactical nuke will kill your phone in this thing.The speaker and camera work surprisingly well inside this case. I was especially impressed by the camera: comparing shots side by side I couldn't tell the difference with or without the case.The touch functions also work very well, and the screen is not impaired visually by the built-in protector. Note however that getting the protector wet makes the screen act up- screen's fault, not the case; these capacitive touchscreens aren't designed to function underwater.It enables use of all ports and buttons while in the case. The charge and headphone ports are protected by rubber caps.Con:This is one of the most expensive cases you can buy, especially now that the S3 is no longer top line and most other case makers have cut their product costs.Inevitably, the case adds a great deal of bulk and heft. In fact, I'd say it makes the S3 viable for use in hand to hand combat due to how much bulkier, heavier, and harder it gets.The buttons are considerably harder to press while the case is attached. This goes for the home/power keys, volume rocker, and the softkeys. The softkeys are fine when you touch them, but they're so deeply recessed that this is hard to do.While in the case, the microphone is muffled. This is unavoidable due to the level of protection, but it also makes the phone much harder to use as a phone. I called my wife with it on and she could barely understand what I was saying even when I raised my voice. You'll probably need to use a bluetooth headset when making calls.The case is difficult both to put on and remove. It's a two-piece design and you have to work these big metal clamps that snap the two halves shut. This is probably unavoidable to ensure watertightness, but it kind of kills its utility as a 'grab and go' travel arrangement. If you need to swap batteries or SD cards, this also makes it more of a pain to do so.So who and what is this case for? Straight up, I'll say that this level of protection is unnecessary for typical everyday use. Unless you're either obsessively terrified of damaging your device or the clumsiest person in the world (or I guess, both), you're not going to need a case this robust carrying your phone to work and home. It also impairs functionality enough that it's very awkward to use on a regular basis. I've had a Caseology TPU case on my S3 for about 5 months now and it's protected it just fine- literally not a scratch on the phone. This case retails for a whopping $9 at the present, considerably less than the OtterBox Armor even with the latter on sale. It's protective enough to keep the device safe despite short drops, and actually affords some spill protection as long as you don't dunk the whole thing. And best of all, the phone is still thin and light and easily usable despite the case being on.There are only a few situations I can see where you'd really need a case like OtterBox Armor:1. If you're going to take your phone into a very harsh environment, e.g. a trek into the Amazon rainforest or climbing Everest. This will ensure the phone survives even if you don't. It doesn't matter that it impairs functionality because you probably won't be making many calls from the boondocks anyway.2. If you know your phone is going to be handled in a place where it's very likely to be dropped, crushed, or spilled on- i.e. anywhere in the hands of a child.3. If you want to use your phone in the bath or shower.4. If you're too lazy to take your phone out of your pants pocket, and prefer to drop both into the washing machine.So basically, this is a 'sometimes use' case for most people. Get a cheap, lightweight case for everyday use, and when you're doing one of the above then change it. If you never do any of the above, don't buy it- in all likelihood you'll never use it. Personally, I've found one good use for this case so far: turning my S3 into a waterproof baby monitor in conjunction with an IP camera. This way I can watch the baby while taking a shower. Yeah, probably not your typical use case, but it is kind of cool- your mileage may vary.Side note: the 'neon' color on the dark case is pretty irrelevant. It's neon on the inside but you can't see it when the phone is there, so aside from the port caps it's pretty much just a dark gray case.",3.0,1390521600,"01 24, 2014",OtterBox Armor Series Waterproof Case for Samsung Galaxy S III - Retail Packaging - Neon,22.49,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31slNz%2BeaML._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1242},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies']]"

B00BJN35SQ,A3MFORLOKIOEQY,Amazon Customer,"[32, 34]","I find this case to provide excellent protection, to be easy to install, but difficult to remove and to allow dust into the case.The case consists of a hard plastic shell that snaps into place around the phone, with a flexible soft gel case that then goes around the hard shell. The entire assembly then can be held and removed from a belt holder.Pro:+ This case provides excellent protection.+ There are openings for all the major connectors.+ The camera lens is well protected, and does not have any plastic over it, so it does not impede taking pictures.+ The dual speakers of the HTC One (which are a major feature of this phone) do not have plastic covering them, so the sound is great. However this does lead to the one major drawback of the case (see below).+ The phone is very secure in the hand while in this case - not slippery at all.+ Once snapped into the belt holder (correctly, see below), it will not come off.+ The phone fits into the belt holder face first, providing excellent protection for the screen.+ There are plugs for the power and the ear jack, although the power button is not protected because it also serves as an IR remote control.+ The built in screen protector does not impede the functions of the capacitive screen, although it can be a bit of a press when swiping the top menu bar.Con:- The case bulks out the otherwise thin HTC One, but this is needed to provide the protection. However some people won't like what it does to the beautiful thin design.- One has to be sure that there is a final ""snap"" when inserting the case into the belt holder. The first couple of times I used it the phone fell right out. I discovered that one has to be sure and push the two together firmly until a second ""snap"" is heard.- Otterbox made a design choice with this phone that causes a problem. The front of the case has a built in screen protector, but unlike other phones, it has cutouts for the two speakers. The top cutout is fine and flat, but the lower cutout is somewhat large, and allows dust to get into the case. I found that I needed to install a conventional stick-on screen protector under the otterbox in order to make sure that nothing got in there and scratched the screen. I understand why they did the design this way - to provide great sound - but it does sacrifice some protection from the elements. One can remove the screen protector with difficulty (try a hair dryer to soften the glue), but it actually has another purpose - if dropped on the face of the phone, the protector assists in keeping the impact lighter than it would be without the extra plastic.- Along with this, the case is VERY hard to remove, which means that those specks of dust are hard to get rid of. To remove the case, one has to ignore the large plastic pieces at the center of each side (those are used to hold the case into the belt holder). Instead there are two small snaps on each side and one on the top and bottom. They can be unsnapped, but it is hard and they were obviously not meant to be undone often. But the design of the screen protector means that they will be unsnapped periodically.Summary: For protection, I'm not sure this one can be beat. But the dust under the screen may cause some irritation - not to the screen, but to your eyes.

Overkill might be a word I'd use in describing it, but sometimes, especially when it comes to phones that cost hundreds of dollars, that can be a good thing. There' no doubt this case will protect your phone from pretty much everything your daily routine can throw at it or be thrown at.One of the things I really like about this case is the fact that the audio and microUSB ports are covered, most every case I've seen just doesn't do that.There are two things that might be considered `cons' for this case.The first is the size, this case is probably three of four times as thick as the HTC One, so you really lose that nice slim profile.  So you have to sacrifice something for that great protection right? It's not exactly bad, but I just felt it needed mentioning.The second thing is that once your phone is in the case it's very hard to get back out of it. The HTC One really has no reason to come out of the case once it's in there though as there is no removable battery or microSD card slot. Still though if you want to take it out you're in for a big fight. It took me quite a while to figure out how to get my phone out of the case, but I got it, and yeah it wasn't easy.

B00BJN35SQ,A14QH03TZ8CRG7,Nth Doctor,"[3, 5]","I decided to pick up this Otterbox Defender for a discount on the Otterbox website a few weeks ago in anticipation of my HTC One's arrival. It comes with a hardcase, a silicone exoskeleton case, and a belt clip holster. The hardcase interior fits just snugly around the phone and has several tabs to keep it together, and the silicone outside case is thick and feels durable.With the case itself, there's not really much wrong. I found the tabs really hard to pull apart at first for those instances I wanted to take the case off, but I found out I had been forcing them all wrong and just had to be a little more dexterous with my fingernails. However, the biggest problem with the case is the built-in screen protector. It doesn't sit perfectly flush with the screen, creating a gap between the screen protector and the screen itself. When pushing your finger onto the screen with this screen protector, you can feel the two making contact and it's just very unpleasant. I absolutely hated the screen protector because in those instances where I took off the case and put it back together, I was always guaranteed to see some speck of dust or debris make its way under, requiring me to take the entire case apart again just to clean it. Very inconvenient.I eventually punched out the screen protector and wore out the adhesive with rubbing alcohol to use an Invisible Shield, which is not the greatest, but definitely better than the built-in solution. If you don't really plan to do anything like that with this given case, I'd shop elsewhere. The main reason I got this case at all was because it was on sale before the phone's launch and has great overall protection. I still use it for now because it makes me feel more at ease carrying such a nice phone on the go. The case is kind of thick, but I would say it isn't too thick.

Having owned OtterBoxes before, I was drawn towards the Defender Series of cases.  However, I was worried that the thick case would ruin the slim lines of this gorgeous phone.  Instead of choosing the Defender Series, I decided it would be best to purchase the Commuter Series case--and I haven't looked back.The case protects the phone from drops and scratches.  It's slim enough that it slides in and out of my pockets with ease, unlike the Defender Series line of cases that can often add too much bulk.  The polycarbonate outer shell (with the silicone inner shell) makes it much easier to take in and out of a pocket or bag--the Defender Series offered up more resistance on tighter clothing or in plastic-lined bags.All in all, a great case from a great company.

It honestly takes about 15-20 seconds to put the case on.  I was running late after having to get a loaner car from the dealership and went to flick the door of the compact car shut - much smaller than my fullsize sedan and I air-balled it. the HTC flew out of my hands, like it was thrown and &#34;cart-wheeled&#34; across the pavement.  After a brief 5 seconds of anxiety I ran, picked it up and the OtterBox had one teeny tiny scuff in the hard plastic.  Phone 100% untouched.  Now, I have accident insurance on my phone, but that is still $99 to replace a phone.

Anyway, It worked just fine in the otterbox case.SPIGEN glass screen protectors:  I purchased the .23 mm version of the glass.  After applying it the Otterbox case was significantly harder to snap together.  I stopped trying to force it for fear of damaging something.  I think the .15 mm version of the glass might work with this otterbox case but I can't say for sure.Other thoughts on quality:  I have had Otterbox Defender cases in the past.  With the S4 case I feel as though they used a cheaper material to make the rubber shell that goes around the plastic one.  It still protects and this is just a personal observation/opinion.The reason I docked one star is because of the plastic film that is built in to protect the screen.  On any of the otterbox cases I have owned this screen isn't that great as I feel it gives the screen of my phone a filmy look ( I hope this makes sense.)  I have heard others just remove it and substitute there own but I have never personally done this and I do have to admit that you can get used too it.  I still dock the star though because in this case where the phone has an HD screen I feel it matters.Bottom line: I do like this case but sadly am returning it since I applied that glass screen protector.  I really do feel like I am giving my phone some serious protection as it takes me forever and some sore fingers to get that dang plastic shell apart even when the phone isn't in it.",4.0,1374364800,"07 21, 2013",OtterBox Defender Series Case and Holster for Samsung Galaxy S4  - Carrier Packaging - Navy/Blue,38.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416ktVwzSgL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 4765},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B00C96CDBM,A2WHQZXGP0DOYS,Buddy S,"[0, 0]","This is the third protective case I have tried for my Galaxy S4 and it is definitely the sturdiest and appears to offer the maximum protection.  The back, sides and corners of the phone are well cushioned and the included screen protector covers the touch screen without affecting its performance.  There are protective flaps over the charging port and headphone jack, which close securely when they are not in use.  The on/off and volume buttons are completely covered by protruding buttons which operate without any problems by pressing on them.  There are openings for the Home button (it is the only button not covered), earpiece, light and proximity sensors, both cameras, flash, speaker and microphones.The holster holds the phone very firmly, so firmly that it is difficult to release the phone from the holster with only one hand.  This is not an issue for me, however, because I do not use the holster on my belt.  I have used the holster on the sun visor of my car and it keeps the phone close while driving.  The kickstand on the holster performs its function well and holds the phone at a comfortable viewing angle when the phone is on a table and I am seated.When the phone is laying on a flat surface its back, the rubberized material of the case keeps the phone firmly in place.  However, the phone slides easily when placed face (screen) down on a flat surface.  I therefore usually lay the phone on its back when putting it down on a flat surface and rely on the screen protector to prevent any potential damage to the screen.Installing my phone in this case was challenging.  Although the process was fairly intuitive, I had difficulty removing the screen protector from its holder.  The directions included in the box, which consisted only of a simple diagram, were useless and the on-line directions on Otter's website were not any more helpful.  Unfortunately, by the time I finally got the phone installed in the case, there was a permanent scratch on the membrane of the screen protector, but this does not interfere with viewing the screen.  I eventually found an instruction video by a user on removing the membrane on YouTube, but only after I had installed the phone in the case.This case substantially increases the size of the Galaxy S4.  I usually keep my phone in my side pants pocket and inserting and removing the phone from this pocket is somewhat difficult with this case on the phone - considerably more difficult than with other cases I have tried.  On the other hand, this case offers excellent protection for the phone.  I think it would be most effective for those who leave their phones out in the open for long periods of time or who work in dusty or rugged conditions, such as in construction.",4.0,1390780800,"01 27, 2014",OtterBox Defender Series Case and Holster for Samsung Galaxy S4  - Carrier Packaging - Navy/Blue,38.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416ktVwzSgL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 4765},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B00C96CDBM,A9Y5O2R4D6EH5,Careful shopper,"[0, 0]","It was a bit of a challenge to get the Defender open to insert S4 but that might be a good thing in the long run..Total weight on digital scale with the holster attached reads just over 7 ounces.  Over 4oz without the plastic holster attached.When the clip on plastic holster is not attached it still fits into a pants pocket which is how I like to carry my phone.  If you like it on your belt or waist band the holster with click can be put on the front or back of the case...  that is, screen covered or showing as it's clipped onto your person.Yes, the buttons on the edge of the phone are a bit harder to press through the protective surround, but nothing horrible and serves as a reminder that your S4 is protected well.  Charge port and headphone port have flexible parts of the case to seal them, but attached on one side so can't be removed and lost.Don't expect the ""vibrate"" function to be as pronounced and useful as it was before as the S4 is that much more insulated from your person to feel the vibrations as before...This Defender is not waterproof rated even if it seems that way.Otterbox has a new case that is waterproof if that is what you need.  It's the new ""Pursuit Series""Clear part that goes over your screen is very clear and touch screen feels just the same as without to me.it is attached to a snap on frame that is part of the case and NOT a press on static type film.Although, with the new Gorrilla Glass 3 Samsung is using on the new S4 I never had a worry about screen scratches even with nothing over the glass.  More protection is welcome as long as it works as well as the Otterbox design.One BIG thing I like about this case that I didn't expect was that the sides stick up far enough above the screen that I don't press screen icons close to the edges by accident just from holding the phone. Hooray!I'm sure I won't be the only person that will find this as an unadvertised feature...If you can't find the ""Kickstand"" feature, just open the clip as far as it will go and press the latch on the case, it will catch on that part and hold it open so you can set the Defender at an angle on table etc.I do like this case so far and hope that it saves the insurance deductable if I ever drop it... at that point I would raise my review to 5 stars ""I love It"" rating.Now for long term field testing...

B00C96CDBM,AFZZ053NRHLI8,CBE2011,"[0, 0]","The OtterBox Defender is the best case for the Galaxy S4 in my opinion. It is bulky, but makes it easier for me to hold the phone. The Galaxy S4 is so light and thin on it's own, I always feel like the phone will go flying out of my hand at any moment. I had a thin silicone case before I got the OtterBox and I was always worried about dropping it because it was very slippery, but the Defender has the rubber part on the outside which provides for an excellent grip. I never worry about dropping my phone anymore because it's easier to hold, but if I do drop it (or my daughter) I know it will be protected.It is very hard to get the case off if you need to clean it. I like to clean my phone about once a week because with these cases dirt and dust tend to get trapped under the built in screen protector. Those are my only complaints (hard to remove and collects dirt very easily under the screen protector).

B00C96CDBM,A2NJQF2UI60VGT,ChicagoCPA,"[0, 0]","I heard first hand and read many a tale of phones that survived significant falls due to this case and I did not want to pay for insurance any more (especially now that I have multiple android phones available as backups) so I decided to give this a try.The two plastic pieces snap together nicely and come apart well (lift at the tabs).The rubber that wraps around these two plastic pieces seems to be a very good material and should last a long time and should have no problem with being removed and replaced many many times.  Plus it make the phone feel good and non-slippery in hand as you use it.The clear screen protector was okay, but I did eventually remove it and the double sided tape that held it into place came off quite well with little to no residue.  I put on a Steinheil Spigen SGP Ultra Crystal screen protector instead.  There are many advantages to having a screen protector of the highest quality and physically attached to the screen, but the biggest one is that should the screen crack, it will still be usable.  My wife dropped her phone and was able to use it just fine for months with a very cracked screen.  It is now our daily alarm clock.I had to shave and round off and the prongs at the bottom around the USB port so that it would fit into my modified SmartDock, which also has 3 parts removed so that I do not have to take off the case for either my S4 or my wife's Note II.  Well, I have to take the rubber part off of this case, but that is no real issue.  It was also required for the MHL 2.0's rather large MicroUSB plug to fit without removing the case.I am generally afraid to handle my phone without this protector on and with it on, I feel I can use my phone all I want without fear.The belt clip fits well and does not seem like it would break or slide off as easily as past ones have for me.  Update: It has slid off a couple of times these past few months, however the phone is none the worse and I have a tracker enabled should I discover it missing.One negative is that I can never feel it vibrate (keep reading for an update on this point)Another is that the clip is uncomfortable when I do not have a shirt tucked in.Another negative is that, while the clip allows you to stand it up in landscape mode, it is at too sharp an angle (about 85 degrees I'd say... I think 60 to 75 degrees may be better)After getting this Case, I purchased the Samsung EP-CI950IBUSTA Wireless Charging Cover and found that this case does not work well with the thickness of the new back cover.  I finally got it to snap together by removing the inner lining of the plastic case for the back of the phone.The unexpected bonus of the tight fit is that I can now fell the S4 vibration alarm when using the Otterbox case.

B00C96CDBM,A3LLMT0DX24Z9K,Gadget Master,"[1, 2]","I always take care of my smart phones.  They usually look new when I am done with them.  My last phone was a Motorola Droid, which I housed in a TPU case.  It looked nice and protected well for scratches. However, when taking one of my walks I tripped. The phone did not fall far - but it was far enough.  Devastation!My new phone is a Samsung S4.  I love the phone - but it does not seem as sturdy as my old Droid. And that Droid shattered. So I need to protect my S4.  I purchased two top rated cases to see what is best for my needs: the OtterBox Defender and the Trident AMS Kraken.Summary:Both the Kraken and the OtterBox Defender were real close for my needs.  The one that I ended up using is the Trident AMS Kraken.My final choice was because I felt the Kraken to be somewhat better than the OtterBox.  I got quite frustrated by the proximity sensor not working correctly with the OtterBox.  This prevented me from accessing the phone after the screen turned off during calls.  I also felt that the body of the Kraken would protect the phone better.If interested in my reviews, I have another write up for the Trident AMS Kraken case.Detailed review of the OtterBox Defender case:Appearance:  I chose the blue color.  Very nice shade.  The case consists of a colored polycarbonate shell covered with a slab of black silicon. Of course the case made my thin phone look huge - but that is the price that one pays for protection.  I feel that the OtterBox Defender looks plain.Physical characteristics:The inner polycarbonate shell acts like a skeleton, adding strength to the phone.  The outer silicon liner cushions the phone and absorbs most of the shock.The inner shell goes together easily and has a good fit.  Taking it apart to clean the phone was at first hard.  After a few times it was not so bad.The silicon is stiffer than that used in many products because it is so thick.  It extends over each corner of the phone.  The silicon is easy to install. If you place the phone face down the surface is protected by the silicon.  This seems to be a very high quality silicon and will protect the phone against most small accidents.The silicon provides two additional features: the volume and the power switch are covered, and there are plugs for the headphone jack and the USB connector.  The volume and power switch are well protected, but they are also hard to use. The silicon is just too thick and stiff.  At least the odds are that the power switch being accidently pressed while in one's pocket is slim. Of course a substitute when the screen is off is to press the home button. But you really should be able to easily use the power switch as needed.  The headphone jack cover works great.  The USB connector cover fits well - but it is sometimes difficult to guide a USB connector into place.  This sometimes is frustrating connecting power to the phone.There are no cutouts or other consideration for ventilation.  Most of the time the Samsung S4 runs cool.  But at times it did get very warm.The polycarbonate front bevel extends enough to protect the screen, but not too much to obstruct any of the active portion of the screen.  Unlike other cases, the notification bar can readily be accessed without any extra effort.  No fear of hitting wrong buttons because there is not room for your fingers.The soft silicon outer shell makes it simple when you put the phone down on a surface.  It will not slip.  It will not damage the surface. Yet it is sufficiently smooth to easily slip in or out of your pocket.The silicon does not pick up pet hair.Other factors:Sound quality - phone calls:  The phone speaker worked quite well.  When talking on the phone you can easily hear the other party.  Now for the bad news. The microphone does not work well in this case.  The other party can hear you, along with echoes and muffled sound.  I got continuous complaints from people that could not hear me properly when on calls.Sound quality - phone speaker for music: no degradation of sound quality.  Not that the S4 speaker is that great in the first place .. but the case does not make it any worse.Sensor access: The S4 proximity sensor does not work with this case.  Once activated, the sensor gets stuck (confirm with the CPU-Z and AndroSendor tools).  Why is this important?  One use of the proximity sensor is to determine when to turn off the screen.  If you get a phone call and you put the phone to your ear, the proximity sensor will turn off the screen. Access to the touch screen is prevented so that you cannot accidentally press buttons. The problem is that the sensor does not detect when the phone is moved away from the ear.  When you move the screen away from your ear, the screen should become visible and you should be able to use the touch screen. With the proximity sensor not working, the screen does not free up until the other party hangs up from your call.  If the other person does not hang up you cannot use your screen again! During the call you cannot look up contacts, or do any of the other multi-tasking that your phone is designed for.  On some S4 forums, I read that black cases do not seem to have as much of this problem.  I also read that some people claim use of a black magic marker around the opening where the sensor is located helps.  I tried using a black magic marker and the sensor worked better - but still not consistently.  Carefully applied you can hardly see the black.Screen protector: the top portion of the polycarbonate shell has an integrated screen protector.  This is the thickest screen protector that I have used.  It seems quite rugged. It resists fingerprints and cleans up quite easily.  The phone's touch screen worked surprisingly well behind this plastic.  However, it felt different - the screen was close, but not as responsive as with other cases with more pliable films. I did feel comfortable that the screen was well protected.Support: I called OtterBox support because of problems with the proximity sensor.  First contact had a new inner shell that was shipped immediately.  There was no attempt to support beyond that.  When I continued to complain, they readily permitted me to return the case for a refund. So good news is that they took responsibility to provide a refund. Bad news is that they did not actually try to solve my problem.  If this was a unique problem I could understand.  However, looking at other forums I see that the sensor problem is fairly widespread. I would think that it would be more responsible of OtterBox if they would solve the problem.  That said, my son-in-law has an S4 with an OtterBox defender (grey case).  Works perfectly for him.Belt clip:  Sturdy and works.",3.0,1379894400,"09 23, 2013",OtterBox Defender Series Case and Holster for Samsung Galaxy S4  - Carrier Packaging - Navy/Blue,38.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416ktVwzSgL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 4765},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

I got the actual case. In the actual retail packaging. It is just the color that I thought it was online.So far, it went on pretty easy, though I can see it may be difficult to remove if I need to remove the battery for whatever reason. I checked the charger and that seemed to go in pretty easy. I have not checked the part that uses earphones yet. The ""Square"" does not work with the case on, though, you can input the numbers directly. As I often use this device, that is not going to be a big deal. If I ended up using it more I may have to figure something else out.. However, the Paypal device works fine, though it is hard to push down.

The hard plastic screen works very well and does not cause response problems to the various finger motions/slides and pokes. The overall protection level is OUTSTANDING. I have witnessed 3 drops from chest level onto a tile floor and no damage has resulted whatsoever. This is the precise reason we bought these cases. The accessibility of all the buttons and jacks, as well as the camera lens and speaker/microphones is perfect.This is a terrific case. My only criticism is the case is a bit difficult to take apart for cleaning (dust can accumulate on the inside of the front screen over the period of a month or two). I feel one of these assembly/dis-assembly runs is going to break the locking tabs that hold the hard plastic portion of the case together). the rubber surround is a great shock absorberI do not comment on thin versus thick or aesthetics.

It did not fit correctly at all, and the holster supplied with it only allowed you to put the phone into it face down, meaning once the phone was holstered, you had no access to the screen anymore.I carried my Motorola Electrify phone for about 1.5 years, and from day 1, it was in an Otterbox Defender case. I loved it. So, after I sent back the cheapo case, from i-Blason, I decided to spend the extra money and get the Otterbox Defender.I ordered my defender case from Ebay, since I was able to get it there for $29.99 shipped, and at the time, Amazon was $38.50, but as I write this, Amazon is now at $31, which I would have paid the extra $2 to buy it from Amazon (faster shipping with Prime, and great customer service).I have used the case now for a few days, and really like it. The case fits the phone perfectly, and was easy to install. The phone, once in the case, slides into the holster both face up, and face down.The reason I am taking away half a star is because the power button is extremely difficult to activate. You have to really push hard to get the screen to turn on and off. On my old Otterbox case, with the Electrify phone, it only took a small amount of force to get the button to work.Other than that, the case is well worth the extra money you will spend over the cheaper, inferior cases.",4.0,1371168000,"06 14, 2013",OtterBox Defender Series Case and Holster for Samsung Galaxy S4  - Carrier Packaging - Navy/Blue,38.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416ktVwzSgL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 4765},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

And high end smartphones are very expensive to replace if you damage them. This case gives you the best shot at making it past the two year mark without damaging your phone through inadvertent drops, scratches, flexes, and the like.This case appears substantial, and cradles the Galaxy S4 without any pressure points. By all accounts it looks well made and capable of doing a good job of protecting its contents (though I've not tried the protection by dropping the phone yet).The main drawback of this case is that it takes a slim, good looking phone and makes it look like a kid's toy. There's a thick rubberized cover completely covering five sides of the phone. All buttons and ports are accessible, but the whole thing looks like its more fit for a worksite rather than a corporate setting.

If you constantly seem to find yourself dropping your phone or putting in potentially damaging situations this is the case you want. This case hasn't given me any issues with the screen responding to touch or any problems with the buttons (volume and power are covered), The belt clip is surprisingly useful. It can be clipped to the back or the front over the screen to provide even more protection. It does cover the camera when its on the back.

This is the best case I ever got....and I don't even care that the price has dropped to $26. It was worth every penny then, and an even better bargain now. I should also note that the plastic screen protector is still great....and that's with two kids who love to jump on me constantly. I haven't found anything better for my S4. I think enough of this that after a year I am updating it. Good job, Otterbox! :)Price update June 14: Saw it drop to 31 and change, then back up.Update 6/11/13: Just an FYI folks, this is currently at 34.82 and free shipping! This is a no brainer, and a steal. None of the stores around me are giving any kind of discount....if they have it.I still love this case, but I did want to let you know that if you rely on the vibration to notify you, you might miss some calls. This does soften the vibration quite a bit. If you are holding it, it's not a problem, but sometimes, when it is  on my belt with a shirt tucked in, and I am walking, I do not feel the vibration. There is no problem if I am still. I also think that this is in part due to the phone. The vibrate strength, even on full, is not as strong as my old phone, so the extra cushion from the case just softens it up even more....but you know what, this weekend I have seen three people with this phone and Belkin cases and they all had cracked glass!After getting a Belkin case for my S4, it took me only an hour to go out and buy theOtterbox 77-27434 Defender Series and Holster Case for Samsung Galaxy S 4 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black. The difference is night and day and while this is more than twice the price of the Belkin it is totally worth it! Plus, you don't need to spend money on a screen protector, so it really isn't that much more.The Defender is really a three piece, full coverage, case. It provides full coverage for your S4, corners, back, front, screen and it has flip covers for the charger connection, etc., and those flips flip up easily, even without fingernails. The case itself provides excellent grip all around without being intrusive. It is a little difficult pressing the buttons on the face, but my fingers are a little big. One of my FAVORITE things is the screen protector....NO bubbles! Yup, you heard me right, no bubbles. That's because you don't actually have to ""apply"" the protector to the screen. This is awesome. If you look at every screen protector I have reviewed for my iPhones and iPads, they all had bubbles....I have come to hate bubbles, and thought I would have to learn to live with them. I am here to tell you, I am now bubble free (and so is my wife)!!!When pressing the side buttons you do have to press a little hard, but for the protection you get, it's fine. Also, the openings for the camera are angled so that the thick case does not appear in the pictures. The case itself is micro-textured to provide good grip without feeling rough.There is NO interference at all with using the IR when reading and scrolling down by nodding my head or turning a page with a wave of my hand. Sharing pictures and video work equally as well with no perceptible interference. The only real issue is that I did notice a slight difference in wi-fi reception in our house with the case on. It is slightly weaker, but nothing big, and after one day I don't even think about it. The entire screen isvisible and nothing is blocked.The only thing that I would knock half a star for is the clip is uncomfortable and digs into my skin when it's on my belt, and is especially bad when my shirt is not tucked in. They could have made this better, and I wonder ifI will come and downgrade this to 4 stars later because of this. For now, I will say 4.5 stars with an easy round-up to 5.Instructions when installing your phone:CAREFULLY remove the rubber gasket, using your fingernails. There are little spaces along the sides. You need to use these to seperate it or you risk breaking it. Once that is done, the rest is easy. Try not to touch the inner portion of the screen as it comes perfectly clean (at least it did on both of ours). Putting everything together after this pointis easy and takes less than 30 seconds. Gently click everything together and you are ready to go.We both love this case and I highly recommend it.",5.0,1369526400,"05 26, 2013",OtterBox Defender Series Case and Holster for Samsung Galaxy S4  - Carrier Packaging - Navy/Blue,38.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416ktVwzSgL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 4765},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B00C96CDBM,A2AWVROFGSZU4E,My Fake Name,"[1, 2]","****I'm not sure this surprisingly complicated device has ever been explained adequately in the 2,397 reviews that have preceded mine, so I'll take a shot at it.When disassembled as far as you're supposed to go it consists of four pieces.  You need to disassemble it in order to insert your phone, then reassemble it.1. HolsterStart by removing the piece with the spring-loaded clip, called the holster, by pressing on the big tab on one side.The holster is designed to carry the case proper.  You can insert the phone into the holster so the screen faces out for ready use or in for better protection of the screen.  For example, you might want the screen facing in if the mine shaft you're at the bottom of is about to cave in and there would be lots of coal dust floating around.  On the other hand, if you're expecting a call from Barack Obama in the next few minutes, as I always am, you'd want the screen facing out so you could just flip the phone a little towards your face and know whether it's he.  Or is that He?You attach the holster to your belt or your waistband or your tool belt or your love handles using the clip, which then doesn't want to let go, which is good for your phone's health but which also means sometimes it won't let go when you want it to, which problem you can sometimes solve by pushing down a little as you open the clip.Unlike the other three pieces, the holster is optional.  For example, if you're about to engage in a bout of sumo wrestling you might want to ditch the holster altogether and just tuck the phone in its case into your mawashi.The holster adds considerable bulk and a tiny bit of weight (58 grams), but there are three benefits to the holster even if you never clip it to your suspenders or your right eyebrow region when you're drunk to see whether you can simulate Google Glass.  (Answer: No.)-- Kickstand.  The holster also acts as a kickstand so you can set your phone on a table in landscape orientation and watch a movie or something.  To deploy the kickstand, rotate the clip so the top of it, the part nearer the &#34;r&#34; of &#34;Otter,&#34; not the &#34;O,&#34; is resting just above the big tab you used in the step above.  You may rotate the clip 180 degrees and your SG4's display will re-orient itself, but the whole device then teeters a little bit after you set it down and is not really designed to be used this way.-- Grabbing point.  The holster's clip when aligned in the non-kickstand orientation also makes it especially easy to hold the phone.  In your left hand you place your thumb along the left edge of the phone in the usual manner but you can wrap the pads of your other fingers around the far (right) side of the clip instead of having to reach all the way around the back to the much thinner right side of the phone, which also risks that you will click a live spot on the screen.-- Shock-resistance.  Although I'm no engineer, my guess is that the holster adds protection against damage to your phone if it's dropped onto a hard enough surface from high enough up.2. Rubber shellOnce you've removed the holster you need to remove the rubber-like shell that will surround the back of your phone and wrap around the edges to barely encroach on the phone's screen.  This is a precisely engineed piece of neoprene or whatever it is that because of its elasticity provides most of the resistance against impact damage.To remove it, start by opening the two very sturdy port covers -- one at the top and one at the bottom -- so they don't impede your progress or tear in case you get too rough.  Then choose a corner and pry away at it till you see how the rubber shell is attached.  If you've chosen the upper left corner, use the pad of your left thumb to push the very outside corner away from you, towards the back of the case.  Eventually you will see how the rubber shell can be pushed away a little bit from the hard plastic clamshell it encases.  Once you've broken a corner loose you can open up more and more of the rubber shell along the top.  Then you can push the rubber shell away from the top right corner, and then the next corner along, and pretty soon it's loose.Although the manufacturer doesn't says so anywhere, this precisely engineered shell is gluten-free and contains no trans-fats.3 and 4. Two clamshell piecesThe two mating, hard plastic pieces of the clamshell are what most interiorally enclose your phone.  The front and the back pieces are connected by tabs on the back that fit into slots on the front.  There is one at the top, there are two equally spaced on each side, and there are two at the bottom, for a total of seven.To disassemble the clamshell, press on the back piece where a tab is so it no longer lives in its slot on the front piece.  You're going to gradually separate the pieces, and you have to start with any tab or pair of adjacent tabs that works.  Just keep pressing on one tab or another and trying to separate the pieces till they come loose at that point.  Once you've separated that tab and its slot, use your fingers to make sure that little gap doesn't close and move along to the next tab, then push it in and separate it from its slot.  This is kind of fiddly, but you can do it.  After a few of these separations of the tabs and their slots, pretty soon the two clamshell pieces will come apart.****Whew.Now, here's how to re-assemble the whole thing with your phone inside, which is why you spent so much money for this product.  Lay your phone carefully into the back piece (mine is labelled &#34;MADE IN MEXICO&#34; for those who care, although I don't know why you would) of the clamshell and then press the top piece of the clamshell onto it, making sure to engage all seven tabs you just so laboriously disengaged.  Unlike some of the steps of disassembly and the next step, this part of assembly is easy.Re-attach the rubber shell.  Shove a corner of the encased phone into a corner of the rubber shell, then start fitting and smoothing with your fingers in one direction and the other.  Eventually you'll get the clamshell entirely inside the rubber shell.  Check every millimeter of all four edges around the screen to make sure there are no gaps.  If there are, just push the rubber against the plastic till it behaves.  If it doesn't, I recommend beating severely on the plastic with a 5-pound sledge hammer till . . . fff Wait, no I don&#8217;t.  Re-write this.You're done.  You've disassembled the OtterBox Defender Series Case and Holster for Samsung Galaxy S4 - Retail Packaging - Black, you've inserted your phone, and you've reassembled the whole thing.  Attach the case to the holster if you want and you're ready to go.****If you bought this product without having read this very review on Amazon, would you be able to perform these necessary steps based solely on the instructions included with the product?

The side keys (such as volume) need to be pushed a little harder. From time to time I do get the oily spots under the screen protector. Someone posted on youtube is a video to fix this by using baby powder. Overall it offers good protection to the phone case and screen.

Don't read this, buy the case and then write a crappy review that says, &#34;love the case but it makes my phone too BIG!&#34; or &#34;love the protection but my smartphone no longer fits into my skinny jeans...&#34;  you get the point.  This case is about PROTECTION.  You simply can't get a better fitting case for PROTECTION.2) You just invested in a $700 or more smartphone/tablet/device that can do anything and more than most desktops found in many homes across the planet.  Why would you not invest a few bucks into PROTECTING your investment?  It takes one simple drop to chip the sides or paint not to mention that the front case could crack.  Yes, there are plans now that allow you to replace your phone, but why go through the hassle of starting new again.3) Yes, the plastic screen protection that comes with it is not that great, but if you have owned an Otterbox before you know the deal.  Peel that one off, invest in a real screen protection film or better yet, get a Tempered Glass Protection screen.4) And as everyone who has owned an Otterbox before knows, the hard clip case is either useless and you never really carry it or you are someone who carries their phone on your hip all the time.  I myself, do not.5) The rubber grip is just enough to be able to shove the phone in your back pocket without too much trouble and yet it has enough grip that it doesn't jump out of your hand while using it one handed.All in all, an excellent case.  You just bought yourself a pretty expensive piece of technology, protect it and forget about the fact that it doesn't have cute little bunnies on it or it isn't olive or baby blue.",5.0,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",OtterBox Defender Series Case and Holster for Samsung Galaxy S4  - Carrier Packaging - Navy/Blue,38.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416ktVwzSgL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 4765},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

The reason I give it a three star rating is because for the protection, you seriously compromise the phone's sleek profile.  Make no mistake about it, this case is bulky and heavy.  Two other factors that make it unsuitable for my use:  First, the built in glass protector.  I haven't used one of these in years.  The advent of Gorilla Glass makes this kind of protection unnecessary, in my opinion.  Plus, when smudged, I like being able to clean glass, not a plastic membrane.  Second, and more distracting is the belt clip, or more specifically, the top of the belt clip.  This may not be applicable to those who are more svelte but for me, it's constantly digging into my side.  Last, the port covers sound like a good idea in theory however, I found the inconvenience of having to pry open the cover to the respective port, then keep it open with one finger while trying to attach the charger or headphones, not worth the effort.  So, for me, as good as this case is, the bottom line is, it's overkill.

And finally, a tough rubbery outer shell that hugs around the back of the phone.  I used to have an HTC Evo, and this case is FAR better in quality.  The rubber to this phone isn't the kind that will stretch out over time like my old otterbox did on the Evo I had.I got the purple one with light teal border around the screen and its slightly a darker shade of purple than seen on my computer screen, but I actually like it better in person!  The purple part is rubber and the teal is part of the plastic shell.  The side buttons are a little hard to press, but in the grand scheme of things that should be a good thing because it's more proof that my little phone is safely snuggled inside.Best of all:  Otterbox backs these with a 1-year guarantee...so if you break it, lose parts or whatever, they will replace it for free!  Just google their 800 #.  I did this for my old otterbox and they sent me a new one right away.Definitely worth the money.  You wont have to re-purchase more phone protectors after this one.

If you put it together, and don't take it apart to change batteries, then it will last a life time.  But, and a huge but, if you change batteries, as I do, then the little clips that hold the case together, will start to break and render the case useless.  That is if you don't use the rubber outer protector.  This will keep the inner case together.Bottom line is I will order another one as the price has dropped.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++I guess I should read descriptions more, because I didn't realize this comes with a screen protector too.  Well made and about 15 bucks cheaper than buying it locally from my provider.This is an awesome protector for any phone, and the plastic screen saver doesn't seem to hamper the works of the original touch screen at all.  Cleaning is easy, just wipe it without worry about messing up the screen of the phone.  The belt clip takes some getting used to, but after about two days use, I have figured out the best way to wear it with my daily activities, (the clip swivels so you can rotate it 360 degrees.At first, it was aggravating with the very tight fit of the case and holster, because the first time I tried to change the battery, it actually took some negotiation and patience to get everything back off.  Yes, it's that much of an exact fit. But, as the saying goes, ""practice makes better"" so have I become with changing batteries and thus, it's not that much of a hassle anymore.I don't like the fact that the only way you can clip it to a belt if via a ""pin"" contraption, instead of both, the clip and a ""loop"", gives this a thumbs down. I prefer a ""Loop"" while at work and also out in public as it makes it really difficult to accidently become unattached with the phone or to have it ""lifted"" from you by a thief.The main reason I am so adamant about a ""loop"" over a clip is that it is easier than most will admit to dislodge a clip from your belt and you will not even know it until it's too late and you have totally lost your phone. Once, while getting out of my vehicle to pump some gas, I accidently dislodged my phone from my  belt and my phone fell to the pavement while I was pumping gas... After returning from paying for it, I just happened to look down and low and behold, there laid my phone right under the door of my vehicle. If I had been I a hurry or wasn't so attentive, I would have drove off and thus, been out of a phone and would have had to pay full price for a replacement, not to mention what the increased bill could have been if someone had found it and decided to dial 900 numbers on my account.",5.0,1373328000,"07 9, 2013",OtterBox Defender Series Case and Holster for Samsung Galaxy S4  - Carrier Packaging - Navy/Blue,38.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416ktVwzSgL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 4765},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B00C96CMEK,A381DJQ1K57GI1,Mark Twain,"[0, 0]","Pros:- Great working case.- Looks it will protect my phone without adding much bulk. There seems to be some air-gap between phone and cover. Assume this is to protect phone from falls..Screen also seems to be protected, if it may fall on flat surface. It seems that rubber supports will absorb the shock if phone fall down.- All buttons are covered.- Better look than other Otterboxes.- Good opening for earphone and charger.- Transparent to show some beauty of your phone.-  Sticks on my dash-board. Such a great convenience if you  need it to keep there sometimes, say for GPS use. Deal breaker for me.- Phone does not seem to slip - great benefit of using a case.- Very easy to open or clean.Cons-- Not sure about durability of the case especially the 2 halves. Some times they come apart e.g. once those came apart while taking my phone out from my pocket. I feel those should be more secured. But having other pros , I think you can live with it. I hope those will not come out if phone fells down.- I wish case should be more transparent showing beautiful phone.- I am not confident if rubber on outer side (especially on controls) will stay intact or wear out. Hope it stays.Summary:It is a great choice assuming that 2 halves will not get loosen more and rubber on outside will not worn out.  I am happy with this purchase but It has been only 2 months since I got this case. Despite all the cons mentioned above, I would recommend this for Galaxy S4.Why I did not get other Otterbox Cases:- I think Defender is too bulky & Commuter is very slippery. I guess Defender may also interfere with some sensors due to its built in screen protector.- You don't want completely hide your beautiful S4.",4.0,1397347200,"04 13, 2014",OtterBox Reflex Series Case for Samsung Galaxy S4 - Retail Packaging - Vapor,29.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41X2JICB22L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3495},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies']]"

I ended up with the Otterbox Defender for the Active and I am pleased.  I DO have an extra battery for my phone and changing out batteries will be a hassle, but that is one I am willing to deal with in order to gain the two layer protection that Otterbox provides.I've been using Otterboxes for the past 4 years and they have continued to evolve and listen to customer feedback.

All of the buttons and the screen are responsive.  The earphone flap fits nice and snug back in it's spot.Everything just fits and works.

B00ESYNN80,AC4H6TDSOSLA3,gdinero,"[63, 65]","I purchased two cases to try with my Moto X.  An Incipio Dual Pro and the Otterbox Commuter.The executive summary is this, if you can handle having a case that's slightly bigger, slightly heavier, and in general slightly bulkier, the Otterbox commuter is hands down the more protective and better designed case.  The Otterbox offers:1. Cushion zones.  I don't know what else to call it.  The inner corners of the rubber part of the case is ribbed, so that the outside corner of the case is actually lifted off the outside corner of the phone.  This allows the case to absorb some of the fall if you phone falls down.2. Harder rubber.  I think they did this to make the cushion zones in the corners effective, but the rubber closely resembles hard plastic now in the corners.3. Covers for the ports to keep out dust and sand and stuff.When comparing the two cases against each other (Incipio vs Otterbox):1. Otterbox is 10 grams heavier, 44 grams vs 34 grams for the Incipio (as reference, there are 29 grams to an ounce).  It doesn't sound like much but my hand that holds the phone can tell.2. Otterbox is wider and longer.  It's 135mm long on the phone and 73mm wide.  The Incipio is 130mm long and 69mm wide.  Again, the difference is small, but my hands (which are small for a guy) do not like the feel of the Otterbox.3. Otterbox is the better case for protection.  Incipio is the better case for holding the phone.  And they are about equal in price after you factor in that the Incipio does not include a screen protector.My advice is to buy a couple of cases and see what you like.

But wallet cases are very limited.  The idea is that they are cases for occasional use, such as when you are going out for the night and only want to carry an ID and credit card.  This wallet case can only carry three cards or two cards and three folded bills.Otterbox Commuter cases are two piece cases that have a silicone layer covered by a hard shell.  They aren&#8217;t my favorite because the hardshell doesn&#8217;t quite fit right leaving tiny gaps.  Two piece cases take more effort to get on and off which is more of a problem on a case made for occasional use.  The black on black color scheme turns the handsome iPhone into an all-black design-free box.Otter likes to put rubber plugs over the jack openings which offers extra protection, but is a pain when you want to charge or plug in headphones.  The volume button covers work well, but the on/standby button cover make it stiff and lacking in tactile feel.  Otter provides a clear screen protector and applicator card.Cards fit in the wallet case by sliding down the back panel revealing the compartment.  The slide is stiff and there is no grip for your finger to press against.  You have to press against smooth sloping plastic.  When you get the slide open, you have to dig you finger nail under the top card so you can pry it up and out.This wallet case is too much trouble for me.

I have superglued it back together, but it's a bad design there.  I don't even know how it broke; got home one day and discovered it was - hadn't dropped the case.  It could very likely have caught on something and snapped; it is flimsy and wiggles a bit (but only in that one spot).  Overall I got the Otter because they don't make an Incipio case for this newer iPhone, and I love having the slide in back for cards / cash.  There is more room in this one; I can fit two cards and a folded bill back there.  It is also more secure in the latching and easier to slide open than the Incipio - BUT - It is extremely hard to get the hard case off the rubber sleeve, which I have to do if I want to listen to music with anything other than the headphones it came with, because the case has a narrow profile near the headphone jack.This case could use some improvements with the hard case, but otherwise I like the spot for holding my stuff - a gal has to have a place for her stuff.

Grippy? Check. 80's Volvo-like Styling? Check. Yep, it's an Otterbox all right.But one with a twist. Because this case resolves that nagging dilemma we all have: how do I carry my iPhone AND my credit and ID cards in one place?Dilemma resolved. This case is that place.Otterbox added a sliding tray on the back of one of their tough cases. From the front and back and the added ""bump"" isn't noticeable. In profile however or in the palm of your hand it's there alright. Think of the top of a 747 and you'll get the idea.

It stays shut pretty well.  I imagine over time and sue, it may get easier and easier to open.  My only concern would be that it becomes too easy, but only time will tell. I have learned to deal with the added bulk, and found that it doesn't add much additional weight.  The only other hassle I discovered was that the cover on the charging port tends to push out the charging cable if there is a bit of movement on the phone during charging (i.e. charging in the car).****Before you purchase this product and plunk down money on this item, you will need to really think long and hard as to why you want a protective case with these particular features. If protection is the primary reason, then this may fit you.  But if the sliding tray featured is what you find tantalizing, you have to be aware of its drawbacks.I personally was very interested in the sliding tray feature because I want to be able to carry my phone and a couple of cards - my credit card, driver's license, and maybe some emergency cash as one unit.  I would probably need to access this tray about 1-2 times per day depending upon the activity I am doing.  My previous case had a pocket sleeve that you would insert your cards into, but it made me a little nervous about slipping out.This tray is very difficult to slide out.  So it does provide good security so it won't accidentally open, even if dropped.  But if you want to access it frequently, you need the grip of a gorilla to get it open.  To do so is also awkward.  You can't really open it with the phone facing you.  It has to be flipped over and then the top part of the tray has to be pushed down with tremendous force with most likely, your thumb.  I almost pooped in my pants with all of the force I had to muster up.  If you have long nails, you'd better get the value pack of prepaid visits at your local nail salon.  And if you got your Galaxy phone because of its slender sexy look, you have to give that up too.  This thing makes your phone bulky and it will be about as sexy as Woody Allen or Larry King. Take your pick.The plus is that the case is very durable.  It has a dual shock protection of a silicone case that slips over your phone which then  goes into the hard plastic case. The silicone sleeve is notched in the area where the charging port and audio jack are.  This lets you  keep those covered when not in use preventing dirt from getting in.This would be a really good case to have as a drug or condom stash, but when I think of ""wallet"" an easier access comes to mind.",2.0,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",OtterBox Commuter Series Wallet Case for Samsung Galaxy S4 - Retail Packaging - Black,34.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41heTvZ5L0L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3547},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Wallet Cases']]"

I'm all for carrying as little with me as possible and I almost always have my phone with me. There are times when I just need my driver's license, debit card, and maybe a few bucks in cash. Why carry everything else around?After trying this case I have an answer to that question. This case certainly provides the Otterbox protection you would expect. It does indeed hold about 3 cards comfortably, so that is nice too. However, there are three main failings with this case.1) It is very thick, even by Otterbox standards. It is also pretty heavy.2) The outer casing is plastic rather than rubber. Imagine the reverse of what you would expect with Otterbox. This makes it very slippery.3) It is not easy to get the wallet compartment open. I found that I had to flip the case over and use both thumbs to slide it down. The first time I got it open I was afraid that I was going to break it.Because it is the commuter series it does not come with a plastic cover built into the plastic. However, they do include a screen protector in the package. This is the kind of screen protector that takes a little bit of skill to apply unless you don't mind a ton of bubbles on your phone's screen.I think that this case might be ideal for someone who was just going out for the night, particularly a woman with a purse. It's going to be very big in a pocket. The good news is that with the Otterbox protection the phone should be OK when it slips out of your hands as you grab it to take a quick photo. It also might be handy if you take your phone when you exercise.

They hold up where others fail, and in that are hard to beat.TheOtterBox Commuter Series Wallet Case for Samsung Galaxy S4is a highly innovative product in that it combines the toughness of a good case with a slim concealed wallet. The concept is great, but the execution may not be so good for some. Will try to keep this simple, and remember that these are subjective points:&#9670; Strong Points:+ Excellent smartphone protection; very durable+ Self-adhesive screen protector; installs simply+ Good fit; easy phone installation+ Innovative; clever design&#9670; Not So Good:- Wallet section can be difficult to open- Thick case; thicker than most&#9670; In Use:This is one cleverly designed and innovative case, quite original and well crafted. But in actual use, it proved to be a bit of a hassle when used as a wallet substitute. The clever wallet drawer holds ""up to three cards and one bill,"" and for some this may be enough, but if you're carrying your ID or driver license, one credit/debit card, another card such as a subway pass, along with a single bill, it may be a bit restrictive.Also found that as many times as I practiced opening the wallet drawer beforehand, when in actual use ""in the field"" so to speak, it became a true display of klutziness when trying to extract the credit card when paying at the register. Twice I was admonished to put my phone away and stop being rude when trying to pay. It was an attention-getter though, as some had to ask, ""What is that thing?"" It happens.More than once I had wished that I had been carrying myOtterBox Defender Series Caseand a wallet, and may yet go back to that method. At least there will be more access to cards and bills, along with good smartphone protection for the Galaxy S4.&#9670; Summary:ThisOtterBox Commuter Series Wallet Caseis a well-crafted product, but for the personal use of this reviewer, it's a 3-star product at best, and probably not a good choice.

It's an OtterBox so you get the quality you'd expect and like all Otterbox cases, it's pretty bulky.  This one is even bulkier than usual because of the storage space so the real question is whether you want that or not.  The case still fit my generic car holder, but it ended up being too thick for my Sony QX100 clamp, sadface.All that said, and 5 stars notwithstanding, the concept is something you might want to pause and think about.  Having your phone stolen is bad.  Having your wallet stolen is worse but your wallet is usually in your pocket while your phone is more frequently out in your hand.  Someone grabbing your phone and running is bad but it would be a lot worse if your credit card is in there.If this is still want you want, I say go for it!  This case is solid.  It's got the rubber lining, the hard shell and the screen protector and if storing a couple things in your phone case (business cards, maybe?) is what works for you, then 5 stars it is.  ....but I still think it may not be the best idea.",5.0,1393459200,"02 27, 2014",OtterBox Commuter Series Wallet Case for Samsung Galaxy S4 - Retail Packaging - Black,34.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41heTvZ5L0L._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3547},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Wallet Cases']]"

The G2 is particularly prone to damage, and I feel like this case will protect it from the abuse I provide.  The plastic is hard and good quality, and the rubber isn't too sticky, and still provides good shock absorption.I don't love how it comes up a little at the bottom, where the internal, rubbery part of the case meets the bottom of the phone, but I dealt with it because of the rest of the benefits of the case.  A bit of glue between the rubber part and the hard plastic would do the trick to keep the rubber from coming out.All and all, good case for sure.  If you have a G2, buy this case.

On one hand, it seems like it would provide extra protection for your phone, but on the other hand, it just about doubles the thickness of the phone, with the corresponding increase in weight. With so much bulk, you'll probably have to keep removing the case & putting it back on every time you want to attach & detach the phone to a dock/cradle/speaker. Is the extra size & expense worth it?I guess that depends upon what your specific needs are. If you're the kind of person who frequently drops their phone, or tosses it onto a table instead of placing it there with care, then this is the case for you. But if you're someone who's more careful with your possessions, and have rarely, if ever, dropped your phone, then the bulkiness (and expense) of this case is probably more of a hindrance than it's worth.For me, this case is far too much trouble & expense than it's worth.

I ordered the ""new"" Defender Case for my Iphone 5, returned it and ordered the ""older"" Defender case for the Iphone 5 for the following reasons: The ONLY difference between the two cases is that this ""new"" case has an open ""cut out"" over the home button for finger print recognition, which violates the integrity of an excellent Otterbox built in screen protector- which sits a MM above the screen- and with the ""new"" version, let's in dust.  The ""older"" Iphone 5 case has a fully sealed screen protector over the entire face, including the home button.  If you've got a 5s and don't want to use the ""finger print"" feature and post your fingerprint online, save $20 and consider the previous version.

There is a large camera cut out in the back of the case with slanted edges to allow the dual flash to be used with no issues at all.  My two small gripes about the case are these.  First off, the bottom of the silicon shell in the front of the case sometimes is slightly raised.  I don't think it can be helped as the design of the case doesn't really leave much room for more reinforcement.  This is a very minor thing that most people probably will not notice.  The second thing again is a part of the design that they probably can't fix.  This being that the opening around the TouchID sensor is open to allow for it's use.  This could allow dust particles to get between the screen the the screen protector.

B00F3SISYO,A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q,"David Wolf ""Misanthrope""","[1, 1]","Don't misunderstand.  This is an excellent case for what it is designed for, which is protecting the iPhone from falls, bumps, tosses, and perhaps the occasional hammer.  However, if one does not have a tendency to have these mishaps, it just seems like overkill.It makes the phone about twice as thick, an inch longer, and more than twice as heavy.  (Estimates)The built in screen protector works smoothly, but is ultimately unattractive because of the oily rainbow appearance it adds to the iPhone screen.Slipping this thing in and out of a pocket can be a real pain, which explains why they feel it mandatory to include a holster.The rubber plugs that block every single port are just in the way.  I'm not sure why these are necessary, because from other people I've known with Defender cases, and from these other reviews, this case isn't blocking any dust.In summary, this is wonderful protection for the accident prone or sadistic (or masochistic), but after using it for a while, and noticing any pleasure of using the iPhone get sucked away by the bulk and interfering rubber plugs, I can tell this is not for me, at least.Getting one for free to review has been a good thing, though.  I have had my iPhone 5 for over a year, and even though I am careful, there are a few tiny scratches and nicks in places, and in hindsight, it may be better to have at least enough of a case so that one does not have to worry about where one sets the phone down, and enough of a lip over the front edge to prevent accidentally nicking the screen.  Screen protectors are really not necessary in that scenario, and I haven't used them with any iPhones.So, Otterbox has convinced me to purchase an Apple iPhone 5/5S case, for just enough protection, but maximum elegance.

I was actually pleasantly surprised that there is not an extreme amount of bulk with this case.  I think they have made progress over the years.  My one wish is that the case didn't add 5mm of height to the phone vs the Spigen case.The case is easy to install, fits perfectly, and even comes with a plastic screen protector built in.  The screen protector does diminish the feel of the screen, but it is tolerable.  All of the openings line up perfectly, and it even protects the power port, mute button and earphone jack with moveable rubber pads. The case feels great to hold, and you can still use fingerprint recognition on the iPhone 5S.  The opening in the case for the power port is wide enough that your iPhone should be able to sit on a lightning equipped docking station with no problem.This ought to be standard equipment for anyone who equips a teenager with a $650 phone.

There obliviously is no perfect case out there, but the Otterbox Defender is the very closest thing I could find to it. I will let you know a few key things that sold me.Defender Vs. CommuterThe Defender offers more protection than the Commuter, but the Commuter is a little thinner. I prefer the rubber on the outside of the case so you can set the phone on a dashboard and it will not slide around. The outer shell on the Commuter is plastic which can allow for a slip in your hand too. The Defender includes a screen protector and the Commuter does not. The whole idea behind the attached screen protector is to keep dust out. One day after having the Otterbox on my phone, I already noticed dust building up under the screen so I put some Goo Gone on it and pulled it off with ease. Any other screen protector that applies to the phone and not the case works much better.Defender Vs. Other CasesWhen I first purchased my Iphone I bought the Neo Hybrid case and I loved the slim fit and lay on the table appeal but a few weeks later one of the other kids in my college class dropped his phone and it shattered his screen. If you YouTube the Defender and any other case in the market you will usually find drop tests. I found it interesting that people on YouTube only do drop test from waist height when testing all of the cases on the market. I am sure that is the height of most of the drops that will occur but what happens if you drop your phone while on the second story balcony? The Otterbox Defender was the only case I could find that people dared to test it from a second, third and even fourth floor of a building.  In case you were wondering, not even one drop test from that amazing height failed. I don&#8217;t know how you can ask for anymore protection for your very high dollar phone? It is logical that if any other case was comparable then people would dare drop from such heights too. Not to mention the quality of rubber of the Otterbox cases is superior to all other rubber types in other cases. It is a studier hard rubber. Another positive to the Defender is that it has covers for your ports so dust will not get in. I keep my phone in my pocket and I was amazed at how much dust and lint got into my ports each day. With the Defender there is no worry.Defender Vs. Waterproof caseAs for water protection? This case is not waterproof but a have heard my share of horror stories with the &#8220;waterproof&#8221; cases. My sister and a co-worker both had Lifeproof case and both had leak issue and a ruined the Iphone.  The cases are a hit and miss and too much of a gamble for the price you pay.In closing, you cannot go wrong with the defender case. If anything happens to your case within the first year you can just take a picture of the damage and send the picture to Otterbox and they will send you a new case. I used to worry about dropping my phone, but now I can say I have absolutely no worry thanks to the Defender. I recommend this case to everyone!",5.0,1385164800,"11 23, 2013",iPhone 5S Case- OtterBox Defender Case for iPhone 5/5S- Realtree Camo/Max4 Orange (Retail Packaging)(Works with TouchID),42.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aXVIHn3eL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8234},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies']]"

So when i upgraded to the 5s I couldn't find the new otter-box defender anywhere. Came home and jumped on amazon right away.......*POOF* there it was. Until I got my new otter-box i put a temp case on it (incipio dual pro) it was ok, just not an otter-box though. The Defender Case snaps around phone securely like the iPhone5 case does. When sliding the rubber bumper around into the grooves of the shell, you will have to massage it into place. There are 2 tiny tabs at the bottom by fingerprint opening. Those need to be pushed into place for a secure fit. I takes some doing, but nonetheless it goes together nicely and fits great! I feel 100% better with the otter-box in place. I work for a living so the last thing I am is gentle. Rubber that fits over the shell is non-slip and offers great grip. Material is not like a TPU cover.

B00F3SISYO,A24RT6AVJXJZHF,"John P. Thiel ""John P. Thiel""","[2, 2]","I don't usually put a case on my phone at all, unless I'm doing something athletic or outdoor sports.  Generally, I just stick it in my pocket.  But I pay for insurance with my cell phone carrier for all the devices on my plan in case I break them and need them repaired or replaced.  Currently, that's a top of the line iPad, an iPhone 5 (mine), and my wife's iPhone 5S.  I have a good, shock resistant case for my iPad that also looks good, my wife has a decorative case for her iPhone which barely offers any protection, and as I wrote above I usually don't use any case at all for my phone.One person I asked about why they put a bulky case on their phone answered, ""I'm protecting my investment.""  If a cell phone is an investment, it's the worst kind.  It depreciates rapidly.  Just ask yourself how much you would pay for someone's used 4S or 5 at this point.  Not much of course.But these things cost a lot of money, even if you're getting a discount.  My wife's 32GB 5S on opening day cost me $300 on paper, but there were several additional charges, so let's say it was at least $400 out of pocket.  I would be stupid not to protect this expensive item in some way against damage; but I always purchase the insurance because not only does it protect 'my investments' in terms of damage, but for wear and tear, complete destruction, theft, and just plain losing it somewhere.  Over the last several years, I've had two phones repaired and three replaced, well worth the price of the insurance.OK, but insurance is expensive, right?  That's where you have to consider your options.  This particular case, for this model of phone, only cost about $35 currently, versus fully insuring the phone for $8 a month / $96 per year--you likely spend more on coffee at Starbucks.  So if I'm fairly confident that I will never ever lose my phone and it will never-ever-ever be stolen (I live in New York City, where stealing iPhones is common) then the case seems like a good deal.  But if the case cost $60 or more, then the insurance would be the better option.Aside from cost is the case itself.  Otterbox of course is the most famous for protecting your electronics better than any other brand in terms of impact, dust, and so forth, and some people just plain love the bulky, 'military grade' armor plating because ... because ... because they just do. but I'm a bit mystified by some of the design features--for which I took away one star.If you're going to go this far to protect a cell phone why not go all the way and make it water resistant as well?  There's a plastic window protecting the Apple logo on the back while letting you display it, but no window or gasket door for the camera and flash, so obviously water, dust, and sand can still get in.  There is also no cover for the ports, speaker, and mic on the bottom of the phone, or the home button on the front.  In other words, this case is ONLY impact resistant, where as the Life case for example is also water resistant.On the positive side though, there is no problem working all the buttons on the phone even under this thick armor.  This is a vast improvement over the Commuter case that I had for a previous phone which fit loosely and made using the buttons and accessing the ports difficult.And lastly there is this great holster clip.  While I would never wear something like this on my belt, I love it for my TimBuk2 messenger bag and outdoor sports gear.  I have absolutely no worries about this coming off if I choose to have it hanging out on a strap or even clipped to a pocket--only I would have to slip it inside a ziplock bag if it started to rain.BOTTOM LINE:Consider what it costs you to buy a pricey protective case versus just insuring the phone.  At the current price, this is a good deal and good option if you're reluctant to add another $8 to your wireless bill.The phone couldn't possibly be better protected from impacts and drops, and the holster is so secure that I doubt there any risk of it falling out while maintaining easy access.The only thing that is really inadaquate about the design is it's lack of water, splash, dust, sand, and rain resistance.  I would make sure to carry a ziplock bag with me if there was any chance I would get caught in the rain while using this case on my phone.",4.0,1390003200,"01 18, 2014",iPhone 5S Case- OtterBox Defender Case for iPhone 5/5S- Realtree Camo/Max4 Orange (Retail Packaging)(Works with TouchID),42.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aXVIHn3eL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8234},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies']]"

B00F3SISYO,AQYYUN3T7B0WM,Karen in Mommyland,"[0, 0]","For years I've heard my friends rave about their OtterBox cases.  They just love them and I honestly never saw the appeal.  They looked big and bulky and the grippy exterior of the case is something that is certainly not for me.  Most people I know who have an OtterBox Defender case tell me they got it because they've broken a phone in the past because they dropped it and it shattered.  So I can understand why some may feel the need to get a case such as this.In the past couple of months we've had some experience with the OtterBox Defender cases for iPhone 5C, 5S and 4S.  We've found with all three that they're incredibly difficult to put into or take out of the case.  From start to finish it takes several minutes to put a phone in this case.  With this case, the plastic screen protector wasn't attached to the case like it was supposed to be.  Instead it was found floating around in the box.One thing is pretty evident with this case.  If you drop your phone, it is going to be well protected.  So if you're someone who tends to drop your phone all of the time, then you very well might want this case for your phone.Both my husband and I gave this case a try with our phones and we both disliked the bulk as well as the plastic screen protector.  I couldn't get the screen on my phone to respond well with this screen protector.  I like to be able to carry my phone in my back pocket or in my wristlet that has a spot for my phone.  With this case, I couldn't fit the phone in my pocket or in my wristlet, so I lost interest in the phone quickly.  I also didn't like that I can't dock my phone on my Belkin charger with the case on it and I don't have the time or desire to take the case off every time I want to charge my phone.My husband's chief complaints with this case aside from the bulk was the flap that covers the button to turn the sound on and off.  The flap is not only difficult to open, but those with larger fingers may have difficulty actually accessing the switch on the phone.I don't like the case, but I suppose someone who needs a good deal of protection for their iPhone may like it.  If you're like me and don't like added bulk then this case is likely not for you.",3.0,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",iPhone 5S Case- OtterBox Defender Case for iPhone 5/5S- Realtree Camo/Max4 Orange (Retail Packaging)(Works with TouchID),42.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aXVIHn3eL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8234},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies']]"

The padding on the Otterbox is real official good quality and good for the phone.  the clips are hard to get undone because they are different from the 4s case clips, these clips are all around the whole case clipping the two pieces together with was a little but if a struggle to get apart.  the apple logo and the screen are both protected to a tee with the nice thick high quality cellophane covering them (however the screen protector messes with the touch and i will be taking it off very soon and applying a normal self adhering screen protector to the actual phone.Now on to the silicone which fits perfectly around the plastic shell and i like this reversed feature about the defender than the commuter because it is more protective.  anyway this is by far one of the most protective, durable and sturdy pieces of silicone i have ever had wrapped around my many mobile devices.  previously i have bought a backup case until this came and it was an Otterbox Commuter series -- it was fake.  the silicone was cheap and bulged around the lightning port, but this case has ports that lay flush with the phone. also the buttons are much more tactile than that fake Otterbox.  all in all i am very impressed with the build quality of the silicone.When it comes to the belt clip, i like the 4s better.  this one does not cover the screen in ull and i feel like t he 4s looks better.  this one like good but just not as good as the 4s.Bottom line -- you know how on the actual page this is sold on amazon, it says that the seller is ""Ottebox"" well I've concluded that you don't have to worry about the case being fake -- you have to worry about this ---- since these cases are priced down so low from 60 dollars they are just what Otterbox claims are ""rejects"". I've inspected the case very closely and found that the top is not cut with as much precision because there are tiny barley noticeable little flaps of uncut silicone hanging down.  and on the belt clip there was sticky ""stuff"" that i was able to get off easily. thats just what i have notice but that doesn't make that case fake nor as protective because it still is the same quality.Pros- sturdy- looks nice- stays flush with the phone- 4 layers- all cutouts are there- protectiveCons- reject but still a really good case (kind of the same)buy this case you wont regret it",5.0,1383955200,"11 9, 2013",iPhone 5S Case- OtterBox Defender Case for iPhone 5/5S- Realtree Camo/Max4 Orange (Retail Packaging)(Works with TouchID),42.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aXVIHn3eL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8234},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies']]"

B00F3SISYO,A2BYFGD27QAIOG,Lee,"[0, 0]","This OtterBox features a nice case with a belt holster, which is great for those people who want that extra hand free availability of their device.  The holster itself is made out of plastic, but feels great and highly durable. The clip on the back has a flat area that would touch your belt with small ridges so you wouldn't have to worry at all about it harming your belts material.  The clip itself is both easy to open, and yet feels very secure. When the case is inserted into the holster, you have to bend a little area back to fit the case inside then let go.  Once you've done so the case is snug into the holster, and I had no fear of it coming loose or of me accidentally knocking it out.The actual case is a normal Otterbox case, which means loads of protection. It has two layers, which includes a smooth inner plastic case that snaps open and closed. The front of this case has a screen protector built into it, and the back of the case, were the logo is cut out, has a built in screen protector there also. I, personally, had a little bit of trouble trying to push the side tabs to unsnap the case, but I guess in the end this is a good thing as it tells me my Iphone is not coming out easily. Once you've opened the inner case, you can see a nice slightly padded area in the back where your device rest on.  So don't fear any scratches on your new device in the case!  I've actually had a commuter series OtterBox for an Ipod, and it slid open for easy access.  However, doing that caused a lot of scratches on the back of my device.  But with this one, you don't have to worry at all!  Once you put your phone in (and I do recommend cleaning the back and front of the screen protector before you put your phone in) just snap the case closed all around, and your ready to put on the outer case! This last case is made up of a soft plastic outer lining that encompasses the hard case. It does cover the power button, the volume keys, the audio jack, the dock connector, and even the silent key. The only areas exposed are the speakers, the camera in back, and the camera/small area in front. Now, I will say I do have on another screen protector, and a back screen protector from another case, and I never took them off before slipping them into this new case.  This was just laziness on my part, and curiosity to see if the touch screen would work, and it does wonderfully.  So I think I'll just leave it.  Now, the only part that isn't too secure is the fact the built in screen protector does have a cut out area for the touch sensor home button so we can still use that feature.  I don't necessarily like it as debris is still able to get under that cutout.  Also, and this could be because of my duo screen protectors, there is a little oily gloss here and there on my screen, but it's only noticeable when my phone is off. Other than that great case, and I do recommend it if your prone to dropping your phone!***update***The cutout area for the home button is now my worst enemy.  I've had to literally get my husband to take off the case (as I broke quite a few nails trying to pry it open to no avail), to clean the inside of the screen off.  I'm actually quite thankful I have on a screen protector underneath the built in OtterBox one as debris loves to squeeze it's way inside, especially since I put my phone in a messy purse with all manner of things flying around.  There is a slight gap also where the screen of my phone touches the screen protector so it is very easy for tiny particles to get inside the case.  Once cleaned it's all good, but it only lasted a week or two before it needed to be cleaned again.  The oily spot that was there actually went away, and my screen is pristine.  I've also had the chance to mess around with other high dollar cases, and even though the cutout home button could use work, this case is still one of the best choices out there.  Sure it adds some bulk, but I have no issue hearing people, or people hearing me, the touch screen is highly responsive, and I definitely have great drop protection as I did drop it on tile floor, where it landed face first.  Not a scratch.

Unlike my other Defender case, where the screen protector is unnoticeable, the screen protector on the 5c Defender case is VERY noticeable, intrusive, and basically unusable.  Had to remove it, which defeats one of the key differentiating points of the Defender series case.I wavered between giving a 2 or a 3, but ultimately I am giving it a 3.  Everything except the screen protector appears to be good, and I believe it will still offer solid protection.

B00F9OQRZE,A1WQ34TQB0ASTN,"DL ""DL""","[1, 1]","Most reviews listed are for the ""Defender"" so I will write a real commuter review..... This case has thick silicone like the defender and a plastic shell to go over top and side. It comes with a stick on screen protector. As long as you use your brain and actually clean your screen and remove the dust, it works great. **tip** turn off any fans in your room and apply to phone while sitting at a clean kitchen table so there is no lint floating around*** line up the edges perfectly or it will hang off the edge and will bubble up when you put on the case. Happened when I did my wife's, but mine is perfect... Of course....  Once you get it on, it is tough to remove and try again with out jacking it all up, getting finger grease and dust under it.  The rubber stays firm around most of it and you can tell your phone is protected. There is a substantial lip over the front of the glass which is nice. I would bet this is same size as defender but without the built in screen protector everyone complains about bc it has opening at home button.  My only gripe is the bottom which is why I took off a star. If you look at most other iphone commuter versions, there is rubber and plastic in between the ports at the bottom. Usually they have covers that go in the ports.... Not on this one.... There is a huge oval opening at the bottom with nothing holding the rubber from separating if dropped on the edge of something. Yes you can fit any adapter in the headphone or lightning port bc it will just spread apart like Moses did the ocean.... Looseygoosey.... Overall solid but I am picky with my cases.

B00F9OQRZE,AHNHLGKIZ2N3B,"D. R. Jeanclerc ""Reader, Listener & Obsessive...","[0, 0]","Many people love the supreme protection offered by the OtterBox Defender phone cases.  However, I always found that they took away so much of the sleekness and portability of the phone - unless you work in a dangerous or punishing environment where your phone is constantly at risk of utter destruction, they seemed like overkill.  Enter the OtterBox Commuter - a slimmer case designed to afford protection without adding a tremendous amount of bulk.  However, this generation of the Commuter has a notable change prior versions that severely hamper its performance.The Commuter comes with three pieces:  a standard screen protection film (only one - so the logo on the back of your phone will be exposed to scratching if that matters to you), a rubber sleeve that covers most of the phones edge buttons/switches and provides a bumper lip around the front screen, and a hard plastic shell that snaps around the sleeve and provides (some) shock/drop protection.  The Commuter does not include any sort of holster or clip.The pieces all fit very well on my phone and installation only took a minute or so.  The bumper lip is a good depth for protecting your screen when the phone is face-down.  It is also grippy enough to prevent the phone from sliding away from you, e.g. on a dashboard.  The shell protection on the back adds about 1/8 of an inch to the phone's depth - not too cumbersome but enough to provide good crush protection if you frequently pack your phone or carry it in a messenger bag.The problem is that the hard shell does not extend around the bottom of the phone at all.  The only protection on the bottom is from the rubber sleeve.  Not only does this offer inadequate drop protection on that side, but the thin rubber strip across the bottom eventually begins to stretch and bow ever so slightly after repeatedly tugging on it when pulling your phone out of your pocket or bag (and this is basically unavoidable).Performance-wise, the Commuter does well.  All buttons, switches and jacks are adequately reachable and responsive through the protection.  The bumper lip does crowd the very edge of the touch screen a bit and can get in the way when attempting some pinch/swipe motions near those borders.If only the Commuter had extended the hard shell along the bottom edge of the phone, then this would easily be a five-star review.  I'm glad that OtterBox is working to bring down the bulk of its Defender series, but there is still some design improvement needed in order to make this a can't-miss case.",3.0,1392854400,"02 20, 2014",OtterBox Commuter Series Case for iPhone 5c - Retail Packaging Protective Case for iPhone - Black,29.54,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vz9FQQJwL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1300},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies']]"

I am therefore doubly disappointed with this purchase of the defender series for Note 3. The holster locks the phone in by clipping over a little recess on the part of the case which covers the device itself. The problem which develops is that the recess itself breaks quickly meaning that the phone will no longer stay in the holster. This appears to be a major design flaw because both of my recesses have now broken and the holster has been rendered completely useless. In my opinion the holster is an integral part of the defender experience and offers some additional protection as well. This flaw makes the defender less than what Otterbox claims. I'm still intending to use the case without the holster, but the damage is unattractive and to be quite honest annoying. The defender series usually offers superior protection to that afforded by the commuter series and to other cases imo, but if having a functioning holster is also a requirement (given the fact that it doubles as a device stand) then I'd skip this and look elsewhere. I hope to get a replacement case from Otterbox, but that isn't looking likely so I'm just sticking with it while I research other options.

It does add bulk but, for such a large phone its not that bad. Every thing is covered,  the home button,  charging connector all have sturdy flaps to keep dirt and debris out; yet everything that needs to be exposed is. The mic, speakers, cameras have perfectly placed openings.  The power and volume buttons are easy and comfortable to use. There is a plastic cover over the screen that I was worried about,  but it works fine, even with the skin screen protector I already had on. There are three parts of the main cover,  the front plastic I mentioned, a rear plastic cover that has a thin soft padding, and the rubber that covers the back, sides, and all the openings.  If you carry extra batteries,  like I do, this case is tough to get off and back on.The separate plastic holster doubles as a stand. You can put the phone in either side,  there are notches that snap the phone into the holster. On the back,  the belt clip turns (rotates) so you can carry the phone either landscape or portrait.  When using it as a stand the phone sits in the bottom corner holders and rests nicely against the back. The viewing angle is not adjustable but it is comfortable. I can set it on my night stand,  plugged into the charger,  and read or view my clock.It seems to offer great protection. The rubber back cover wraps around the front and is raised around the screen for additional front protection.

They are Armor, Defender, Commuter, and Relfex/Prefix, with descending level of protection and physical bulk.Compared to the Armor series, the Defender does not protect against water splash nor crushing force, but it is definitely much less bulky.This series also includes a holster, so that the phone can be carried on the outside of body for convenience. For screen protection, it is best to attach the phone to the holster with the screen facing in.Not even the Armor series will protect against forces applied to the glass screen, such as dropping a wrench or hammer onto it. Therefore, it is always a good habit to lay the phone face down when not used.The Defender series does really well in terms of protection against drop and dust.Although I think it is excellent for work environments like construction and package/document delivery service, if your use involves rougher than normal handling of the phone, the Defender is a must.",4.0,1393027200,"02 22, 2014",OtterBox Defender Series Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 3 - Retail Packaging - White/Gray,45.41,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Daw7wXviL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3706},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

It is quick sturdy and can take a good fall. It uses plastic rubber for the outer shell and hard plastic for the inside.  A screen protector is included but I prefer my own so I popped it out.  The outer shell at higher temperature feels a bit sticky.  I'm not sure if it is melting from my radiator heat but feels like the analog buttons on my ps3 controllers at high temperatureSize:It feels slightly slimmer than other Otterbox cases of this size (I was checking out my friend's note 2 case) so it can be less protective.Price:I got this at 59.99 USD which is quite expensive when you compare to other cases out there.  However, it was the only rugged case out at the time I got this so it is ok for me.Compare  to other products out there:There are some other products out there which is better bang for the bucks when compare to this case.- Zerolemon has a rugged case with a 10000mAh battery at the same price I got this case at.  Every way that case is equally or if not, better than the otterbox. Additionally there is a massive 10000mAh battery which you can choose to use or not use.- i-Blason has a rugged case for less but quality is questionable (which is in my other review)Overall: 6/10- It is a good case overall and does provide the protection you are looking for.

This case is a definite must have for anyone who is serious about protecting their Galaxy Note 3.Nowadays it's hard to find case manufacturers and by that I mean companies that actually manufacture new original cases, most name brands out there only slap on a label with their logo on random generic cases. You can tell that OtterBox actually puts some time into developing a new product and that their cases are designed and built out of scratch.This case is beautifully designed, it does add a little bulk to the phone but I think it's a small price to pay for the protection that you get. The clip feels firm and strong, looks like it will last longer than the actual phone.

When I switched to my Note 3 a few weeks ago, I was disappointed in the choices of cases out there. I purchased the Otterbox Defender as my 1st case for my note 3 because I was familiar with them. This is hands down the best case you can buy if you are looking for protection. I have purchased several other cases from mall kiosks and online and none of them compare to the build quality and materials of Otterbox.  My only Gripe with this case is the same issues I experienced with my pervious Defender cases, the built-in screen protector isn't the greatest.Like I have done with all my other defender cases, I removed the screen protector because it degrades the quality of the screen. I ended up putting a Zagg HD on my Note 3, but I will soon replace it because it doesn't hold up well against the s pen. I plan on replacing my screen protector with a Speigen Glass screen protector soon. I am worried if the otterbox will fit with a glass protector on the Note 3. I will try it in the next few days and attempt to update this review.Other than the issues I have with the screen, this is a great case for the best protection. The belt clip is a little hard to get on and off, but I like that because it feels very secure.UPDATE: 12/12/2013I got my speigen glass screen protector and installed it with the otterbox defender on it. It fits!!! It did make the phone a bit more heavier, but the clarity is great! I feel this is the best combo.  Glass screen protector from speigen and Otterbox defender is the way to go. The case fits perfectly on the phone with the glass screen protector on it. It feels like I don't have a screen protector on. Every thing is super clear and the touch is smooth. This is way better than the Zagg HD.

B00F9VRNF0,ASRZM8XWU5I37,KT,"[0, 0]","This is the first Otterbox case I've had.  I'm absolutely sold.- The size isn't a problem since the phone itself is so much larger than my previous phones.  Either in my hand, or holding it to my ear, it was already big, so the extra bulk, though obviously noticeable, isn't an issue for me at all.- The near complete encasement of the phone is the most important factor in my purchase of this case, and it delivers in that regard.  I have a 9 yr old and a 2 yr old, and they can drop it (which they have), put their sticky fingers all over it (which they have), and it all stays on the outside, along with scratches and whatever else.  The dust accumulation that builds up in openings on previous cases is also not present using this case.- I simply left my glass protector on and also used the included facing that came with the OtterBox, really just because I wasn't sure how the OtterBox would work and didn't want to reinstall the other screen protector if it didn't work out... but everything still works perfectly with essentially two screen protectors.  Touch sensitivity is fine, no glare, no &#34;rainbows&#34;, and I probably won't worry about removing the old one.- One thing I'm not sure is if they sell just the front Otterbox screen protector seperate if this one starts getting scratched up, I'll have to check that out.  Again, I like the entire front integration, so I hope I can get the front &#34;frame&#34; + screen protector without buying the whole 3-layer case again.- The belt clip is sturdy, almost too much so... I typically have to use two hands to remove the phone from the holder.  I can release the phone with one hand if I try hard enough, but it's not a quick and easy release, it takes a lot of pressure.  That at least tells me it's solidly attached and I'm OK with being aggressive with it.  : )- The &#34;stand&#34; is actually the belt clip.  I wish the cover itself had a built in stand because sometimes I have the phone in a pocket and without the belt clip I have no way to stand it up.

You also don't &#34;pop&#34; your phone in this - it is a decent installation to get your device in this case. You first remove the rubber jacket from the hard shell, then split the shell, then do it all in reverse. You'll need a good 4 to 5 minutes for a good installation.Once in the case, you can click it in the included holster - which works as a belt clip or as a (movie) viewing stand when you pull the belt clip open.There are flaps for the charger port and the headphone jack. It will NOT work with wireless charging. The Samsung charger back is too thick, and the Qi charger accessories that you put behind the original back don't get a good enough signal to work. I also found that NFC is harder to work with.There are openings in the front (for the speaker, LED indicator and camera), the top (for the microphone and IR port) rear (for the camera) and the bottom (for the second mix and speakers).

I will mention thought that the case in white & grey is actually pretty stylish and is a noticeable improvement over there case for the S3.My father in law recently bought an iphone (dumb I know)! You should see the Otterbox for it, it's a brick!  A rectangular piece of thick plastic and he thinks its great (apple).The Otterbox for the Note 3 however is a lot more shapely than a dumb iphone. For example on the Otterbox the case is tapered around the back of the phone (rounded) it feels great in your hand is because of the outer rubber shell is next to imposable to drop or slip out of your hands.Another improvement is the rubber flaps covering the audio port and charging ports the flaps are is a lot easier to flip up when attaching headphones or the USB cable when it is time to charge the phone.Great case especially when you need the ultimate in protection.  Otterbox support is fantastic as well, recently I contacted Otterbox case when the rubber outer shell gets warped out of shape (due to taking it off many times).  Not happy about the thought of having to buy another $54.00+ case Otterbox simply asked for my info and shipped me out a new rubber outer shell free of charge.It's Otterbox, just buy it and be done with it.",5.0,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",OtterBox Defender Series Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 3 - Retail Packaging - White/Gray,45.41,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Daw7wXviL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3706},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B00F9VRNF0,A2H738AYMWJ6QK,The KISS Army,"[0, 0]","I've debated about Otterbox cases for many of my phones over the years as I always heard of the great protection that they give the phone and that they had a holster belt-clip (my preferred way to carry my phones), so I finally splurged when I got my Galaxy Note 3 and bought one.  The case itself does offer great protection, but it's also a little slick in the hand without any type of grip on the sides and isn't the most attractive case on the market - neither though, would lead me to returning the case.  The ability for me to holster my phone on my belt, on the other hand, is paramount to me and that's where the issue was.  It may have been just my case, but when I snapped the phone into the holster, it would click as it should, but with the slightest pressure, it would pop right out of the clip.  This meant, that whenever I bumped into something slightly, my phone would pop off of the clip.  Now, I was lucky enough to catch the phone before it hit the floor each time that it did this, but this is the complete opposite of why I spent the extra money in the first place on this and after that, I had absolutely zero confidence that my precious Note 3 was going to be safe going forward.  I'm about to return this case and have already bought another holster case to replace it.  I bought the Seidio case/holster combo (their highest protection case - forgot the name) and absolutely love it!  The case itself is ok, but has a design flaw that is well documented online, but the holster is top-notch and includes a spring-loaded clip to keep my phone (in a different case) secure on my belt.

B00F9VROO0,A2JAEZ0FMAMJVW,A. H.,"[3, 4]","By way of disclosure, I received a sample of this product for evaluation purposes.I previously had a hybrid Spigen case on my Note 3.  While it looked nice, it added quite a bit to the sides of the phone, which made it even harder to hold.  It also didn't offer much of a ridge around the screen, which made me nervous that I might break the screen if the phone fell on its face.This OtterBox case is narrower around the sides of the phone and offers a larger, rubberized ridge around the screen.The port covers line up well.  I'm not a tremendous fan of them, though, because they put some pressure on whatever connector you're plugging in, which results in lateral pressure on the ports in the phone.  That can't be great.  But they do keep dust out.The side buttons line up well.  I have no difficulties turning the phone off or waking it up, and the volume adjuster works well, too.The case has a plastic shield that attaches over the bulk of the inner case, which has a bit of a rubbery consistency.  The plastic makes it easy to slip the phone in and out of your pocket.I already had a good screen protector on my phone, so I didn't use the included one and cannot comment on it, but OtterBox does provide a small microfiber cloth to help you clean the screen of dust and oils before applying the screen protector, which is a nice thought.Overall, I found this to be a better case than the Spigen case for the way I use the phone.  It isn't ostentatious.  Just functional.  I recommend it without reservation.

The rubber is of the best quality,  keeps it's shape after several times taking it on and off. I purposely tried to bend it out of form and it retained it's shape. The rubber over the buttons feels good, the flaps for charging and aux don't press against their respective cables and they lay nice and flat once put back in place. With the case on, the phone slides easily in and out of my pocket. The included screen protector is crystal clear,  easy to put on as long as you clean the screen throughly before hand, and don't allow any particles to settle while applying. Doesn't interfere with the s - pen at ALL. The pen is actually interpreted by an electromagnetic field behind the screen. For example, place an index card or 3 on the screen and try writing something in action memo.Anyways, I just wanted to mention one more time how this thing screams quality. Totally worth it.

B00F9VROO0,A1HOLE9R6WPT85,Mad Max,"[0, 1]","Ok I'm comparing this to the other case I have, the i-Blason Armadillo (ASIN B00F0R83VG), which I bought on Amazon for $12.99 + free shipping.First off, on both cases, all the holes for speakers & buttons line up perfectly. Don't worry about that.The OtterBox is definitely a great case, but this ""mid-grade"" Otterbox (Commuter series) seems extremely similar to the iBlason which is 1/4th the price.OtterBox comes with a screen protector which is nice (probably a $3 value), and the hole to access to stylus is a little better on the OtterBox.The iBlason has much more protection on the corners (bump guards), which makes me feel it has better drop protection, but it also makes it a bit more difficult to slide in & out of your pocket.The OtterBox also has a slightly sturdier backing to it. Also, I think the OtterBox tries to leave a small cushion of air between the case and the phone, for extra protection, kindof like bubble wrap.I think the OtterBox is slightly better quality overall than the iBlason, though the iBlason has the corner bump guards which are definitely more protection. I give them both 4.5 or 5 stars, but I'm marking the Otterbox down just due to price. The higher models are probably worth $40-$50, but the Commuter should really be closer to $20-$25.If you feel you need moderate protection for your phone (an occasional mishap or drop), I would probably recommend the ~much~ cheaper iBlason. Personally, I'm keeping the iBlason and giving the OtterBox to my wife.However, if you drop your phone daily, have an extreme work environment, or are really really rough on your phone, get the Defender series for about the same price. Or if you need waterproof, check out the Armor series.",4.0,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",OtterBox Commuter Series Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 3 - Retail Packaging - Blue/Navy,31.88,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wmaYekURL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2783},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies']]"
B00F9VROO0,A3SNAJ0VMQ9Z0Z,Mark Freeman,"[0, 0]","Let me start by saying this case does add some weight and size to an already large phone. It is a little harder to get it in my pockets, so understand that before you buy this. If you plan to throw your phone in a bag or your purse, this is a GREAT case. The hard plastic fits the phone perfectly and will protect your phone. I haven't tried a drop test because, frankly, I don't want to risk damaging an expensive phone, but comparing this to my other slimline case, I would worry much less about the phone if something were to happen. That is the point of the commuter series and otterbox is known for making protective cases for travel. If you want something slimline, you should look at something else. I believe they also make a smaller version for the note 3, which isn't quite so bulky.Getting the case on and off was no problem at all. All of the slots for accessing phone features line up perfectly.My only real complaint is the rubber guards they put over the headphone and usb connections. WHY? There are holes for the camera, the s-pen, the mic and speakers, everything.

B00F9VROO0,A1BJOHHLG0D965,"M.D. Edwards ""Avid Aesthete""","[0, 0]","I've got a lot of co-workers that LOVE their OtterBox phone cases, and I've always been such the bargain shopper that the pricing for the average OtterBox device case has always been a bit off-putting for me, but if the pricing doesn't bother you, and you want a quality, name brand, non-knockoff-made-in-China case (as I typically opt for for a fraction of OtterBox pricing), then I doubt that you'll have any qualms with this case, made for the Samsung Galaxy Note III.I've become fanatical about my Galaxy devices. I'm on to my third model here, with the Note III, and I LOVE it! In light of that fact, and in consideration of the price that these OtterBox cases are sold at, if the pricing is right for you, your device WILL be protected.The case fits my device snugly, and the dual-piece rubber/hard plastic layers provide a cushion against the shock of a drop, while the harder shell protects the device overall. It's a clever design that OtterBox (and others!) have used for many a year, and obviously, it's still in use because it's a design that still works.OtterBox also seems to have expanded their color scheme here with this line, which I appreciate. I'm not so much a boring black kind of girl when it comes to my device case, so I'm glad that there are more offerings here. With a less limited personal budget, I just might buy two or three of these cases, and interchange the rubber layer of one case with the hard shell of another, just so I have a few more options to choose from, color-wise.While this model may not be the watertight, fully-sealed OtterBox case that I've always found myself coveting, these cases ARE well made. My standard cheapie-cheapie Made in China cases cover the bases, but they often prove to be, as with everything, cases of getting what you pay for. They look good at the beginning, but they show wear and tear pretty quickly. After having used this case for a few weeks now, it's held up well, and the occasional time or two that I've dropped my device from two or three feet up (still, *GASP*!!!), my device, and the case, have both come out completely unscathed.Overall, a good protective option, if the price is in your range!",4.0,1392854400,"02 20, 2014",OtterBox Commuter Series Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 3 - Retail Packaging - Blue/Navy,31.88,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wmaYekURL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 2783},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies']]"
B00F9VROO0,A22RS9XNLGIRSF,Michael St James,"[2, 3]","I have had many phones and many Otterbox cases, but always the DEFENDER series, which is Otterbox's Uber-Case. I carried my GN2 in an Otterbox Defender for a year, using the belt holster. I've gradually come to prefer front pocket carry to the belt holster. I found that the Defender case is a bit thick and slightly too tactile for front pocket carry. It's very grippy, and built to be bullet-proof. (Not really, but...)So, when I shuffled the GN2 off to my wife and got the new GN3, I decided to go with a lighter case. But I still wanted the best protection I could get without undue thickness, and something slightly easier to get out of the pocket than the Defender. Went to the Verizon store to swap my wife into my older GN2, and noticed the Otterbox Defender in Surf Blue. I normally buy cases from Amazon, but in this case, being paranoid about the safety of my new GN3, I bought the case at the store and put it on there. Also, I get a deep corporate discount from Verizon on hardware accessories.Long story short, I love the protection provided by the Otterbox Commuter, and the balance between softer grip surfaces and fairly smooth flat surfaces for pocket carry is excellent. I also bought a UAG case in Rust Orange (from Amazon, reviewed separately) because I get bored with cases and need something to switch off to from time to time. In my opinion, the Otterbox provides better drop/impact protection than the UAG case because of the two-piece construction; I feel the full soft inner liner of the Otterbox is superior for this purpose. However, I think the UAG case provides better side grip surface insets, and enhanced corner cushions that are handy for pulling a phone out of a pocket by the top edges. The Otterbox Commuter is slightly thicker than the UAG, but not to the extent that it is uncomfortable in a front pocket. I love the deep screen bezel and camera lens insets of the Otterbox, despite the slight additional thickness of the case this requires. Great protection!Installation is very simple due to the two-piece construction of the case. I had put a Verizon-branded tempered glass screen protector on the GN3, and the case did not interfere with the protector at all. The button pressure required to activate the phone controls is exactly right...not too firm, but not light enough to cause inadvertent pocket activation. As with all Otterbox products that I have come into contact with, the tooling and precision are excellent, as good as it ever gets. The case is flawless in that respect. To me, the charging and earphone port covers (flaps of the interior soft part of the case) are superfluous, since other ports are left uncovered. On the Defender, it makes sense, as that case is designed for extreme conditions. On the Commuter, I don't feel they are needed. To me, they're just in the way.I like this case well enough that I may buy another...maybe Merlot or Berry.

B00FH9B5AS,AL3MFYSK9HKCL,"Amazon Customer ""Not all who wander are lost-...","[0, 0]","I have found that if you're in the market for cases for the Verizon LG G2, you're between a rock and a hard place lately.  OtterBox finally came out with a Defender Case, but it was well after the AT&T; and T-Mobile versions.  Maybe we can lay blame on Verizon for making their LG G2 slightly different with button placement.  However, OtterBox delivered with the Defender.  I just like my Incipio case much better.UNBOXING:The OtterBox Defender for Verizon LG G2 came in a small bubble wrapped envelope.  The box is plastic with a plastic sleeve for the actual case to sit in.  It comes with the case, a belt clip/holster, screen film, and instructions.  The case is 5.75&#34; x 3.25&#34; x 0.75&#34;, and when using the belt clip is 6&#34; x 3.5&#34; x 1&#34;.  The instructions are all pictures, so it's easy to figure out how to use it.REVIEW:The OtterBox Defender for Verizon LG G2 is definitely sturdy.  I have no worries about dropping it and having it survive a fall.  However, this case is just too big for me.  My Incipio is 5.5&#34; x 3&#34; x 0.5&#34; with the LG G2 in it, and it's a dual soft/hard case.  I've dropped it a couple times with no problems.  It also fits better in the hand than the OtterBox, considering that it doesn't make the phone much thicker.  Likewise, the belt clip/holster makes the OtterBox that much bigger/clunkier.  I suppose it's good if you want to make sure you don't lose your brick of a phone, but I'll go for something that looks and feels better over the OtterBox.  Finally, the screen film is not really a film.  It's a clear plastic shield that sits between the face of your LG G2 and the outside rim of the OtterBox case.  It's quite thick, so it probably protects the screen better, but touch sensitivity suffers.  I used the case without the shield and got my own screen film and it works fine.OVERALL:I give the OtterBox Defender a 4 out of 5 stars, because overall it's a great phone case for protection.

B00FH9B5AS,AXAJXJZUL2J5P,D. Scott,"[1, 2]","On the positive side, this is a sturdy case that will probably protect your phone better than just about anything out there.  It fits tightly (not going to come off accidentally), and the clip would be very handy.Unfortunately, there were so many things about this case that I couldn't stand, I couldn't wait to put on my old, flimsy case.* I found this OtterBox to be somewhat difficult to figure out how to put it on.  Actually, the problem was first figuring out how to take it apart.  Once I got that, reassembling it around my phone was pretty easy to figure out.  As other reviewers have noted, the instructions (just illustrations) are not at all helpful.* The screen protector is thick, and it doesn't rest right against the screen.  I found that this made my screen much less responsive than I'm used it.  Worst of all, because the screen protector is built into the case, you don't have the option to use just the case and not the screen protector.  Take off the screen protector, and the whole thing becomes non-functional.* The case is huge.  I guess it needs to be, but this is something to keep in mind.  Add the clip, and you've got some serious luggage on your belt.* The case is difficult to remove.  I broke a few nails trying to pry this thing back open.  And then I noticed that a couple of the snaps were bent out of shape.  So I suspect that repeatedly opening this case could eventually cause the closures to fail.Overall, if you really NEED heavy-duty protection, including for your screen, this might still be a good option for you.

B00IPDRQWE,A33OR6LDGCDRMY,Hag,"[3, 3]","This case isn't like the OtterBox cases from a while ago.  The design is fantastic.First: I don't think I've seen a case offer better (non-waterproof) protection.  If I dropped my phone down a flight of stairs I wouldn't even worry.Second: The inner shell snaps on with a perfect fit.  It's actually kind of hard to get off once it's on so make sure you clean that screen protector part really well before you snap it into place.Third: The rubber outer shell is tough but forgiving.  The rubber part clips on to the inner plastic shell all the way around the screen.  On previous OtterBox cases the rubber part only connected to the inner case at specific points which allowed the rubber parts between the attachment points to get saggy and end up looking and feeling like junk.  With the new design the rubber part actually takes some work to remove.Fourth: The entire setup is solid, no creakiness or cheap feels here.All that said there are two down sides to this case.One: The belt clip is massive.  It feels like a TV clipped to your belt.  There really isn't a way around this problem though since the case itself is large.  Anyone buying an Otterbox probably already knows this.  The clip also doubles as a kick stand for the phone.  This doesn't affect my star rating.Two:  The screen protector is kind of janky.  It's the same protector OtterBox has been using for years.  Touch works perfectly through it, but it's not as clear as I'd like it to be and nor does it stick to the screen (it's more of a free floating screen protector).  This allows dust and stuff to get under the screen protector.  Since the case takes some effort to take off the dust problem is mildly infuriating.  I wish they'd stop using this setup and just give you a separate high quality stick on screen protector.  I've already just removed them and moved on with my life.  Again this isn't a big issue, just a personal preference.Overall this case rocks.",5.0,1399075200,"05 3, 2014",OtterBox Defender Series for Nokia Lumia Icon - Retail Packaging - Black,49.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BL77vJuTL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 4385},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"

B00IPDRQWE,ABQWMANK4AR63,"John S. Dean ""John""","[6, 6]","This thing is a bit of a pain to get open in the first place if you haven't had one before, like me.  The instructions are just a few drawings.  After peeling the rubber shell, and you start to split the case itself open, there's tabs that they don't show in the drawings.  They make it look like you just pop it open, but while one edge comes apart easily, the second half doesn't, and I nearly broke the small bits of plastic in the middle of the short ends bending it.  Then I saw the little tabs on those short ends, and used a pen to push the tabs in to get it to separate.  Once that was done, I cleaned my screen well (didn't want any gunk stuck between the protective skin and the screen) and put in in place.  It fit perfectly, snugged right in. I popped the plastic top back on, then squeezed it back into the rubber shell.I'll admit, I was ready to dislike this case before it even arrived.  In the first month I owned my Icon, I bought six or seven cases, trying to find one I like.  I have never dropped a phone or any other PDA since I've started using them in the 90's.  In part due to the fact that I always get phone covers that have some grip to them, since most smart phones themselves are slipperier than greased eels with their polished aluminum and glass.  I prefer a small case that's unobtrusive.  I'm not looking for protection in case I drop one, I'm not trying to keep it out of the elements - those are things I deal with on my own simply by being careful.  I just want a case that's light, thin, and lets it not be so slippery.  For me, ""protective"" cases have always just seemed to be overkill.And now that I've switched away from iPhones again, and am on a phone with a built in inductive charger, my new Jeep has an inductive charger station built into the armrest.  So my cases have needed to fit inside of that.  So I went through a lot of cases to find the right one that fit all my criteria.  This Otterbox doesn't fit any of requirements, other than the fact that it's grippy.  Not just the sides, but the bottom surface as well, so when you set it somewhere, it'll stay there even if it's an inclined surface, or a surface in a moving vehicle.  So I was actually planning to give this the heave-ho when I was done testing simply based on my preconceptions.I had not counted on how well it fit the hand, or how solid and good it felt.  The button covers are pretty much a complete non issue.  They're less intrusive than all but my favorite case.  They cause no problems whatsoever with the button use, they don't add any noticeable required force to operate, they don't feel unnatural and add a bizarre feel as a few of the cases I've tried did.The screen protector gives an odd feeling though to someone who prefers no protectors, only glass.  It's not bad, doesn't really impair use other than feeling like a slightly rougher texture.  In no way did it impede functionality or recognition of any touches, whether in normal phone and data use, or while playing any games.  And I really appreciate the bevel in the front edges that facilitates using the screen.  It allows for that curve in the fingertips so that you can get your fingertip on the very edge of the screen comfortably.  Many are just a straight edge there, and it's awkward and you kind of have to jam your finger into the ""corner"" created by the edge and the surface of the glass.  No issues like that with these bevels.  But it ""floats"" so I can see dust between this and the glass becoming a problem down the road.The phone in the case didn't move it far enough away from the inductive charging pad either, it charges fine wirelessly when in this case.  The holster moves it too far though, so it won't charge with that snapped in place as well.The port covers for the headphone jack and charging port are wider rectangles, so there should be no problems with plugs being able to plug into those ports with the cover on.  The default USB charger that comes with the phone fits fine with a surprising amount of space around it.One of the biggest reasons I dislike summer is that it deprives me of the reason to wear a jacket.  I like jackets since I have pockets to carry things.  I've never liked putting a phone in my pockets, even before I got something as big as this one.  So the holster intrigued me.  I haven't had one of these since a very old Motorola windows phone back in the mid to late 90's.  But now that Wisconsin is finally seeing 50's and 60's, the coats will soon be gone, and the holster could really come in handy.  I like how the clasp can be snapped into the holder and become a little kickstand, although I've never had need for one of those either.  I don't use my phone for watching multimedia or anything, so a kickstand isn't something I'd use.  But it's a nice design element regardless.  One nice feature is how the case is designed to snap into place in the holster no matter which way you have it turned.  The long ends of the phone both have the same indents for the holster to grab, so it'll go in no matter what.  It's a bit of a trick to get used to popping it out with one hand only, and doing it without dropping it, but it doesn't take long to get the hang of it.It does add a bit of weight, not much though, you just feel it's more hefty.  And I actually like that, as it makes it feel more secure in your hand somehow, that extra weight.  Maybe it's just because  you grip it a little more when you feel it, but no matter the reason, it just makes the phone feel better.One other thing this helps with is tilting your head to the side when you're just using shoulder and ear to hold it in place.  The surface of the back, plus the added thickness it gives the phone, makes this a much more viable alternative.  Just a couple nights ago I was trying to talk to someone like that while I was on their computer in a remote session helping them with a problem, and I just couldn't do it easily, and ended up calling them from my landline instead.  This case actually would've negated that requirement.The downside is that it doesn't fit in my car's onboard wireless charging pad.  But I've found that I have a habit of forgetting my phone when it's in there, and I'm running around client sites without it until I need it for something, can't find it, then realize I have to hoof it back to my car to get it.  So maybe not being able to charge in there wouldn't be such a bad thing, I can still use the multiple cigarette outlets or even the 120v outlet behind the armrest, and charge it with a cable instead in the built in charger if I really need to.  But since my computer case has three different charging batteries, running out of juice isn't really that big of a concern for me.So here I am, in the position of actually thinking I'm going to keep using this case, the one that I was ready to throw out even before I received it, because they really did a good job of making a solid, protective case that isn't just annoying in most respects.  It's not so bulky that it's a turn off, the protector doesn't impact either the touch or the brightness of the display, the button covers don't really feel like they're there at all...  It's the opposite of most of the more serious cases designed for protection that I've ever seen, and this one may become my daily case, much to my surprise.",5.0,1400889600,"05 24, 2014",OtterBox Defender Series for Nokia Lumia Icon - Retail Packaging - Black,49.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BL77vJuTL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 4385},OtterBox,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cases', 'Basic Cases']]"
