Nuff said.---UPDATE -- July 12, 2010, for Clarification:Methinks I now understand the disparate reviews. At two different times, I ordered this item, each one from the same 3rd party merchant via Amazon. The first time, prompting my initial review (as well as 2nd order), I received SPN5334A. That is one of 3 listed at the Motorola site as compatible with the (original/Moto) Droid. The other two: SPN5338A (fast rate; looks identical to 5334A and pic above)and SPN5356A (different appearance: flat squarish adapter head).(Incidentally, I checked again-- the 5334A IS also compatible with the Droid X. Don't recall re the other two.)My later/2nd order yielded a charger which looked like the 5334A and 5338A, but it was a different model number. The merchant was great in terms of handling the return with a super-quick refund (while the item was in transit to them!), but the bottom-line is this: as soon as you receive your charger, from whomever, grab a magnifying glass. Turn the charger so that the two plugs face your chest, one under the other. Directly above where the cord attaches to the adapter, look for the model number.If it is not one of the stated 3 compatible model numbers, return it. Otherwise you definitely risk a fried Droid, with weird screen results (selections made without any input from you, screen rolling up and down spontaneously, etc). That's precisely why Verizon replaced my Droid, and the reason why I now always double-check the model number, to be absolutely SURE! As stated, you can't even trust the same merchant to get it right twice. It seems to be an easy mistake to make, since many of these chargers appear identical, at least, without magnifier in hand.Last point: even if the description gives you a model number, such as SPN5334A, double-check upon receipt!! Each time I purchased, the model number in the description read SPN5334A. First time, true; 2nd time, false. So, trust only you in the final analysis! (The description I see on this product description page today differs from that available when purchased.)----My Amazon Vine membership played no role here.

I gave my original Droid to my son when I got the new Samsung Droid Charge, but kept the charger.  I ordered more of these SPN5334A chargers to have in different parts of my house, and one for travel, and although when they came, each wrapped in a plastic bag with that number on the outside, one of the bags wasn't sealed, and inside it was one labeled SPN5356A, also a Motorola brand OEM charger.  Looked totally identical to the other.  I looked up the difference, and though the model on the Motorola website for the SPN 5356A has a different looking flatter plug end than the other, they both supposedly fully charge the phone in 3-5 hours, and on the droid forum I saw the comparison on, was told they could be interchanged.  I have tried both and they seem to work equally well, so I'm not sending it back.  Thought others might want to know in case they also receive one with a different model number like this.  Can't complain about the price!  And it arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  I like this dealer, SFPlanet, and have purchased from them before.

B00169TIG6,A39E7WVMQ653YF,"A. Toll ""Consumer Doc""","[46, 46]","Most manufacturers are only required to manufacture and supply parts for their products for about 7 years, which is the statute of limitations. After this period of time, the challenge is yours as to whether to dump your old but good cell phone and get ripped off by buying a new one in our disposable society.Manufacturers drive their revenue stream by creating this type of planned obsolescence. The lure of more bells and whistles provides an enticement for buying new.  However, I still like to have the choice of simply buying a new battery for a cell phone that otherwise works great.  Unfortunately, I have discovered that you need to be very careful when attempting to purchase an LG OEM 1100mAh battery described as ""new"".  Here are the facts before you buy:1. LG ceased manufacturing these cells back in 2007. Too bad LG didn't tell us that!  This means that any batteries described as ""new"" by vendors are at least 5 years old or greater and have been sitting in warehouses.2. Before you buy, recognize that you will NOT be receiving a ""new"" cell-only one that has been tested, but may not hold its charge at full capacity for the same period of time that a freshly manufactured cell would under normal operating conditions.3. If purchasing, insist that the merchant/vendor sends you only the latest production date on the cell, and is honest in communicating this information to you.-Each LG OEM 1100mAh cell has a production date under the UPC code on the back of each battery.  (For example, DC071013 indicates that the cell was manufactured on October 13, 2007).4. I purchased several of these cells from different vendors over the past few years and have discovered that they may not disclose this to you unless you ask. They are old cells and this explains why they are discounting them substantially. My experiences suggest that they do not retain their charge for more than 1-2 days.  Please take this into consideration before you purchase.5. Remember....""New"" means different things to different folks.  To vendors, ""new"" simply means that the battery has never been used.  To most purchasers, ""new"" implies that it has been recently manufactured and can be expected to retain a full charge pursuant to fresh cell standards.

B001LYRBCO,A1GIHV3V7LW85B,Marcy in Alabama,"[6, 6]","The LG Dare was my first smartphone and I loved it until I ""graduated"" to an even smarter phone, and gave the Dare to my husband, who had tired of his old phone. Recently, his Verizon contract came up for renewal, whereby he was eligible for a new phone at a discounted price (with a 2-year contract of course), but he refused to give up his Dare, in spite of its being all beat up (he had chosen to not use screen or phone covers while he had it). He was adamant about keeping his Dare, saying it did all he wanted it to do, it was the right size and feel, etc., etc. He also did not want to spend the extra money on a data plan he wasn't going to use (we both have plenty of computer access otherwise) so a smartphone was out.  Since I'm the ""geeky"" one in this family I did the research on feature (aka ""dumb"") phones he might like, and unfortunately the pickings were quite slim...it's obvious that the phone companies, or at least Verizon, are moving towards having very few feature phones, if any.  Desperate, I came to amazon--which is where I come first whenever I want to buy something. Not expecting to find it, I looked for and found the Dare through this seller.  The phone appeared to be brand new and we immediately had it activated at Verizon without any problems.  Plus: my husband is not locked into a 2-year plan! This time my husband agreed to a case and screen cover which I also bought through amazon.  My husband is very happy with this purchase,and I hope it will last him at least a couple more years. I should mention that the phone IS internet capable if that's something you do want. The only reason I am giving this item 4 stars is because the cover on the SD slot of the phone was loose.  My husband played around with it finally getting it to fit it, but we're not sure what will happen when he needs to open it again, if it will open or if it is stuck, etc.  This won't be a major problem since more than likely he won't be using the sd card on the phone for his pictures.  I complained to the seller about this and received a response within 24 hours.  By then the problem had been solved by my husband, but I appreciated the seller's willingness to help and satisfy me, the customer. So, the problem is not with the seller, but with a small defect of the phone itself.  I would not hesitate to buy again from this seller, and who knows, maybe in a few years my husband will want yet another Dare!",4.0,1328400000,"02 5, 2012",LG Dare VX-9700 Cell Phone - Verizon or Page Plus,69.96,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41hG19TU6nL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 4175},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

At first I was not familiar with all the functions and keys but I spent the night figuring everything. Right out of the package I inserted my sim card, battery and the phone fired up right away.Pros:Good size phone with a good solid feel. I especially like the feedback from the screen when you touch or use the stylus which folds neatly into the bottom of the phone. The package includes a transparent cover for protecting the screen. Do not be put of by earlier reviews! It does have all the MMS features found on other phones. I loaded the included software and from LG's site, I was able to download the newest firmware update which speeds up the phone and opens all the features. The latest software is kp500_v10o. Calls sound good and i was able to text, browse and e mail with a few adjustments in the software. There are several web sites out there with configuaration info and there seem to be droves of people who like this phone.......you cant beat the price for what it does and how good it looks.Cons - It should come with more apps but i will remedy that very shortly,this is a minor nuisance. One other thing, LG USA does not have any information nor will they help with the phone even though it bears their name. I could not get help to access the USB driver from them. Thanks to the many ""friends"" in cyber space i was able to find it in short order.I ordered the case, a protective cover and a extra screen protector because i plan on keeping this as long as i did my last phone..........5 years.

I don't like the round prongs power plug, but I had an adapter since I have lived in Shanghai for the past several years. I think the user interface is simply horrible to use.  The various functions are needlessly buried in layers of senseless options.  Try to make a call to a company that says press 1 for English, 2 for Spanish, etc.  You have to press and hold the touch screen area called unlock. Then you have to press another area to get a touch screen numeral pad.  By the time you get to this point, the number you called is asking you if you want to repeat the options. The microprocessor in this phone must be the slowest on earth. Everything is so slow and counterintuitive that I get upset everytime I use it. In text mode, they use the same layout as a digital phone. Why they didn't have the option of a Qwerty keyboard is beyond logic.  So there you are pressing every button once, twice or three times when it could have been a full keyboard layout. It does have the option where it tries to guess the word you are spelling, which is good. The phone is usable, but frustrating to use in my opinion.

B001MRZY3S,A1VQHH85U7PX0,"MyBeesWax ""A Music Fan""","[3, 3]","The LG KP500 is adequate if you are using it primarily for phone calls, email, Web browsing, and text-messaging. However, it does have a few problems/limitations:Touchscreen: This phone uses a resistive touchscreen as opposed to a capacitive touchscreen. The touchscreen isn't very responsive at times, which is a real annoyance. (Capacitive touchscreens, such as those on the iPhone and Blackberry Storm, are more responsive and support multi-touch gestures.)Homescreen: You can only add/remove a predefined set of widgets on the Homescreen: Calendar, Clock/Alarm, Notes, Music Player, Picture Viewer, Social Networking (My Space, Twitter, Facebook), and International Time.Single-Axis Accelerometer: The keyboard doesn't always change to a full QWERTY keyboard when you change the orientation of the phone from vertical to horizontal.Web Browser: Browsing the Web using the built-in Web Browser is a frustrating experience. The links on a page don't load at least half the time when you click on them. The page also takes a while to refresh after it's been scrolled. I downloaded and installed Opera Mini, which works flawlessly.Email: The phone can store only 300 email messages. Once the capacity is reached, you have to delete existing emails from the Inbox in order to retrieve more emails. Deleting emails is a hassle: you have to (1) select and delete emails from the Inbox (deleted emails are then placed in the Deleted folder) and (2) navigate to the Deleted folder and delete the emails again before they are finally expunged.Syncing With Outlook: I am able to sync with Outlook on my PC only through USB, not bluetooth. I get a ""Pairing setting is failed while connecting with the device [sic]"" error message with bluetooth syncing. The To Do list is barely functional -- there is no way to sort it and the subject field is only about 14 characters wide. Calendar and To Do List are limited to 500 items.FM Radio: The FM Radio only works with the earbuds (included) plugged in. The earbuds use a proprietary LG connector, not a standard 3.5mm audio plug. The sound from the earbuds is tinny.Camera & Video: The camera has no autofocus, much less zoom capability. The camera is best used for close-up shots (distant objects are blurry). The video is very choppy because of the low frame rate (12 fps).---There you have it.

B001MRZY3S,AGOWZ7HPTOTHQ,Saren,"[31, 31]","I have been looking for a new phone for the last year, since my old T-Mobile Blast was becoming outdated. So, when I took a trip to Germany and found the LG KP500 there, I was quite curious. I looked up reviews here on Amazon, and after some consideration, bought the phone from a German electronics retailer... And I am sure glad that I did!Let's get started with the Pros and the Cons of this phone.PROS:-Unlocked, Quadband World Phone.-Inexpensive. I bought the phone for 89, which is comparable to the price here on Amazon.-Good Quality. Although the phone is small and made of plastic, it has an extremely durable feel.-Signal Quality. I normally have no signal with T-Mobile's To-Go plan in my house, but I usually have at least 3 bars with this phone. By comparison, my last three phones constantly lost signal in my house.-Great features. Many features, including a Movie editor, 3MP Camera, Music Player, Video Recorder, Games, Accelerometer, and drawing pad.-Stylus. Not really necessary, but it really helps with texting and making notes.-Multiple Apps and Task Manager. You can run more than one app at a time, like Music Player and Camera-Widgets. On the home page, there is a selection of widgets to choose from. These include: Music Player, World Clock, Clock, Calender, FM Radio, and Notepad.-Speed Dial Widgets. With a swipe of the finger, the home page changes to a speed dial home page with up to 10 contacts and images.-Downloadable Apps and Games. The phone is Java based, so you can download .JAR apps from a number of sites to transfer to the phone.-Expandable Memory via microSD slot (Up to 8gb)CONS:-The interface, while very sleek and refined, can become slow due to multiple apps running at once.-Texting in QWERTY format is a bet annoying at first, due to the small keyboard. But after a while, you get used to it.My recommendation: If you are looking for a new, unlocked phone at a cheap price, the LG KP500 is for you.NOTE: I own the silver version of this phone, which doesn't have the rubbery texture.UPDATE 10/2010-The phone is still working great. I actually received an update from T-Mobile to allow MMS messaging and internet web-browsing, so the phone is actually better now than it was 6 months ago! Plus, after accidentally dropping it face first into concrete, it still works with no scratches! So that is another plus!",5.0,1272412800,"04 28, 2010",LG KP500 Cookie Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera and Digital Media Player--International Version (Black),74.22,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BiMx1FKyL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 99709},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

B001RMJPG0,A1G8DM2EDMZTOO,Paul Clifford,"[23, 24]","I purchased this product through Amazon (from Seller1ON1) to power a variety of devices, including an HTC cell phone, all which require power from a micro-USB cable.Exclusive of the cables, the five chargers I purchased all worked well and were within their stated specification. They are rated at 5.1V and 0.7A.  For each, I measured their output at 5.1V open circuit, 5.0 to 5.05V at 700 to 830 mA, and dropping to 4.1-4.4 V at about 850mA.  While many low cost chargers sold here are counterfeit items, these chargers (at least the ones I got) are not, they are the real thing.However, some of the cables provided were not reliable.  The cable that's supplied with the charger (LG cable part number SGDY0014303) connects to the charger using a standard USB Type A connector at one end, and at the other end connects to the phone using a micro-USB connector, which is fast becoming the standard for cell phone power.I purchased five sets of chargers and cables, and found that three of the five cables were bad.  Let me describe the bad ones:I haven't used the cables with an LG phone, but using them with several other devices and phones I found that the micro-USB connector was often intermittent.  There is a fair amount of play when the connector is plugged in, and if it wiggles just a little bit the power connection is lost.I microscopically compared that male micro-USB connector with others that I have on better cables. See the photo I posted of both good and bad connectors.The better cables have connectors that are far superior.  The connector on the three bad SGDY0014303 cables have metal contacts that have very little compliance so that only when the connector is plugged into the receptical perfectly does it make a good connection.  If the array of metal contacts are not perfectly coplanar with the corresponding contacts in the receptical, contact is easily lost.  Further, the hole in the connector was a bit too large, making the connector fit loosely.  When I examine the micro-USB male connectors of the other cables I have, I see that their contacts are made of a much larger bent metal spring that is more forgiving of misalignment -- it continues to make contact no matter how much the connector is wiggled in the receptical, and the connection is much tighter overall.I find that when I charge my HTC phone using the bad cables, I have to be very careful to make sure the connector is actually making contact, and adjust it if it is not, so the phone charges.The other two cables are constructed a little differently, and work fine.  All five cables are marked identically, with LG logos that look the same.  Further, the wire gauge and the plastic housing material looks the same.  Even so, examining the connectors under a microscope shows that I actually received three differently designed micro-USB connectors.  Two of the designs work well, but the third design, present on three cables, is faulty by design.For me, this charger is a great deal, but beware of unreliable cables!",3.0,1344470400,"08 9, 2012","LG OEM Original USB Home Charger with USB Data Cable (SGDY0014303) for LG Swift AX500, Incite CT810, Rhythm AX585, VX5500, AX155, Lotus LX600, VX8560 Chocolate 3, AX300, UX300, Dare VX9700, Decoy VX8610, LX400, enV2 VX9100, Glimmer AX830, UX830 Cell Phone",1.35,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41y2hV6fnQL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 4621},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Travel Chargers']]"

I bought one and was so happy I placed another order to replace my wife's charger.Not less than a week before I wandered back into our local Radio Shack to replace the charger they sold me (it burned out after six months). The slack-faced clerk told me I should have bought the Radio Shack replacement protection plan - a 15% charge on top of the $20 item. I told the clerk I'd buy a replacement but it wouldn't be from Radio Shack and I wouldn't buy anything else from them either.So, I came home, logged into my Amazon account and found this charger. I was surprised (and a little suspicious) that the charger was listed for less than $5 with free shipping. The item arrived in three days and worked perfectly right out of the box.

B004BX2HOE,A2A14RBCFGMV7L,Mali,"[2, 3]","I have had TWO of these die. Also, LG has horrible customer service.The first one I had didn't even last a year. After a few months, it started freezing, randomly shutting off, the screen would get stuck on rainbow-colored static...Then it got worse and just shut down. I took it to a local Verizon where they told me it was over-loaded and dying, and talked to me like I was a very slow child. They said there was nothing they could do and they couldn't get my information off. They told me to take it home and transfer all my info to the card. On the way home it died. I called the LG rep and he told me they had no idea what they were talking about and that what they said was not possible. I went to a different Verizon and they said that they COULD have gotten my information out (which i knew), but it was too late now. I was still under warranty, so they ordered me a refurbished phone- they said I could NOT get a different kind of phone, just the exact same one. Unless I wanted to pay full price, of course. I contacted LG, and they said that while they COULD fix it and get all of my information out of the phone after they fixed it, they wouldn't. They would instead fix it, wipe the information clean,and sell it to someone else. And give me someone else's refurbished phone.  Yes, they admitted all of that.  I lost ALL my information and got the refurbished phone from Verizon.Cut to another few months later. No warranty and SURPRISE! It starts again. Freezing, shutting off, getting stuck...Then one day the touch screen just stopped working. I took it to yet another Verizon. This guy had no idea what was wrong and said I would have to call the national line if I had other questions about what was actually wrong with it. He said that the phone was clearly going to die, there was no way to fix it, and I would have to wait 4 months until my contract was up for renewal to get a working phone. 2 hours later...it unfroze and the touch screen starting working again. For the next 4 months, the phone continued to sporadically lose all my photos except 8, then magically find them minutes later, change my background photos, freeze randomly, static, shut off...then...it died.Let me just say that I will NEVER EVER get another LG phone. I will never let any friends or family get one either.Aside from the problems I had with the phone being a complete POS, when it was working, I was constantly having my purse, my pockets, even my arms (when I was carrying a bunch of bags,etc) dial random numbers in my phonebook.Why didn't I lock it you ask? The lock function,if you want to call it that, doesn't actually ""lock"" the phone and require a password to get back in. I'm not quite sure what the actual function is.The touch screen is impossible to use to text; even with my tiny little girly fingers, the screen would constantly choose the wrong letter or number. The voice dial is just as bad, if not worse. You have to scream at the phone, sometimes more than 5 or 6 times and still nothing- or worse- it dials the wrong person.On to the camera-Don't bother taking photos unless it's something LESS than a 1/2 foot away- there is no zoom. Even my cheap Motorola Razr had zoom. You can't take photos from across the room and crop them later- it will make them blurry.Don't bother taking photos unless you are in broad daylight with no shadows. Indoors, you better be directly under light- but not in the glare. 9/10 times the flash goes off, you get a completely white screen. Without the flash, you get a black screen.I can't tell you how many times I missed something, or how many times I stood somewhere trying 8 or 9 times to get a photo to be visible. I don't know about you, but I'm embarrassed asking someone to hold still for 8-9 re-takes, and admitting I still didn't get it.I may make it my mission in life to make sure no one I meet ever buys this POS- or anything LG!",1.0,1336089600,"05 4, 2012",LG Env Touch VX11000 Touch Screen Cell Phone (Verizon Wireless) - No Warranty,70.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SkycQCkEL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 4114},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

I called back YET AGAIN, and they sent me another that didn't hold a charge, the battery was awful with this device (any of the 3) I should have known with my friends experience (9 of these units) it wasn't going to be a good phone, but I read the positive reviews, and they sucked me in.The camera is pretty good, although I would like to see some improvement on the video side. When a video is replayed back on the computer, it retains same good quality, but the sound has somehow turned out to some tinny kinda crap, can't make out what it is saying and is VERY garbled. How anyone understands these videos (what the person is saying or what is going on,I don't know)Whenever I wanted to select something on the touchscreen, I'd tap, and the phone WOULD GET THIS!!!! SCROLL. It wouldn't select. Oh yeah and try to calibrate, it will always tell you that it failed to calibrate, but off-calibration actually got it to work somewhat better.And if you ask why i didn't use the keyboard, was not my chance not to use it. A day after my warranty went out, the WHOLE Inside QWERTY DIED.Oh and then the calls dropped, that was an almost daily occurrence starting a couple months ago. When upgrade time came i got a Samsung Sway phone, and as soon as it arrived, smashed the ENV TOUCH with a hammer, and said &#34;DROP MY CALL NOW&#34;No one should have to have these issues, or suffer through this crappy phone, either get rid of it, or don't get it.

B004LJ8N78,A1CD7IUM2JRPY1,"Alexander V. Ramos ""Doc Taz""","[17, 17]","... for smart phones, that is!The call quality is great. No dropped calls (so far), and I can hear people (and sometimes thebackground noise) clearly.Web browsing is excellent. It runs at 3G REV. A, so the data speed is as good as it gets on 3g.This means streaming through Pandora or other similar service will be excellent, as long as youhave enough signal. Wifi option is great for hotspots and at home with a wireless router, esp. onethat runs at least 802.11gSound quality is great through the headphone jack with my $8 Sony earbuds, or when patchedthrough my minivan's stereo, or home theater. Playing FLAC files doesn't strain the phone.AWESOME! (It's nice to have the 32 GB limit for micro SD cards. =This phone has 3 separate processors. One for main use (600 MHz), one for video (200 MHz), andone for the wireless modem (400 MHz). The amount of main memory is 512 MB, which is more thanenough for multitasking on this phone. No wonder this phone hardly lags when using processorintensive apps. It's no EVO or Optimus 2X, but it really works well for the price.The only times this phone slows down (for me) is when I load large PDF's onto Adobe Reader. Butthat's to be expected. Still, it beats having to lug a tablet around, as I prefer to keep things ascompact as possible while on the go.If you want to play a few games, you can play them here. Most games run smoothly on this phone,as long as 3D video acceleration or Flash isn't a requirement. High Quality clips from YouTube streamwell, though I'd let those load for at least 15 seconds prior to playing. The Skyfire browser is perfect forthis phone. It allows a user to play most Flash video clips without a plugin, while using less 3G bandwidth.To improve battery life, I've installed the free versions of Advanced Task Killer, and Green Power Free. GPFis great for turning off 3g/wifi when the phone is idle with the screen turned off, while still letting calls through.ATK carefully 'autokills' programs from the main memory as needed, which also improves battery life. I getabout 15% extra battery life with these apps, compared to going without them. If you do the steps that LGrecommends, it's possible to have at least 10% extra battery life before recharging. I get about 20% extra atthe end of my day, compared to doing nothing. There must be a higher yield battery out there that won't damagethe phone. If you like to run everything on full, you'll be lucky to get four to five hours out of the phone.I can get about 18 to 24 hours, depending on what I do with it, sometimes less. It's best to turn this phone offwhen you can.If you're looking for a great smartphone with a no-contract plan on a solid cell network, this is a great choice.Just pick a plan, add phone insurance or a service plan, and you're ready to go.EDIT (July 14, 2011): I've changed my task killer to Advanced Task Manager. It includes a regular kill mode, as well as the usual auto kill mode. Regular kill works at a specified interval, whether the phone is being used or not. I have mine set to 30 minutes. ATM even features a startup kill mode that shuts down some apps and system functions when booting up the phone. I do agree with some experts that say that task killers are unnecessary to use. However, I've found that careful adjustment of ATM in my case, along with green power, helps a lot in prolonging battery life, especially with the screen off while idling. ATM is more aggressive than ATK (because of the three kill modes), so sometimes the phone might respond a bit slowly after coming out of screen idle. But after a few seconds, the phone behaves normally.I tried 15 minutes for the regular kill mode at first. That killed too many processes earlier than needed. I find 30 minutes to be better. For one thing, it helps with game performance, as there's more memory available for them. ATM does help with battery life, with or without green power. If you still don't want a task killer, at least use something like green power to prolong battery life.Both apps are worth a few dollars to keep on your phone, but test the free versions first.EDIT 2 (Oct. 3, 2011): I don't even use ATK anymore or any task killer. I've also reduced the number of apps I have on the phone. The only extra apps (aside from what the system needs to run well) running in the background for me are Green Power, and the free version of Lookout. I just go to Settings > Applications > Manage Applications > Running to kill a few apps. No more automated stuff; task killers mostly take up too much CPU. At least they do with this phone, in the few months I've had it. As for Green Power, it controls the 3G data. I toggle Wifi manually.To be honest, I'm not sure how much longer I'll have this phone. The price for the Motorola Triumph ought to drop over the upcoming holiday season. I might change over to that phone then, as enough accessories are available for it (including some good screen protectors). It would be nice to have a phone with built-in flash for the camera. I kind of miss that. 5 megapixels isn't bad either, considering that most pics uploaded to fb, twitter, etc. from the phone have to go through a 3G connection. Not to mention, it should handle PDF's and e-books better than the Optimus. I'll wait and see.EDIT 3 (Nov. 23, 2011): No, I don't have the Triumph. I still haven't rooted the phone, though I'm still looking at that possibility. I considered getting either the HTC Wildfire S, and the LG Optimus Slider. The Slider would've been nice, but it's only slightly faster than the V. The Wildfire has memory and battery issues that would really bug me.I guess what I'm finding out is that because of the squabbles or whatever going on with phone makers and Google... Android users rarely get updates directly from the manufacturers or Google. The only way to get them is to root the phone, or buy a new one every few months it seems. I'm not against rooting. But for whatever reason, I feel less comfortable with that process on a smartphone than I do with adding an extra operating system on a PC. Maybe I'm just wimping out, but I honestly don't see much difference overall if I choose to root my phone or not. (I mean, rooting could help me remove some of the preloaded junk I don't care for, but at this point, it's not a big deal for me.) That's not to say I hate Android as a smartphone OS. At least I don't have a bricked phone. :)Even Linux (the PC/server OS that Android is heavily based on) is more upfront with updates IMHO...EDIT 4 (July 15, 2012): I have had this phone rooted since late November, shortly after I wrote the third edit. I've tried several Froyo and Gingerbread ROMs. The best I've used are from some developers known online as LeslieAnn, and MiRage_666. The mirage guy has the ROMs I use the most, as his packs are well-tuned and regularly maintained. Mirage is also very receptive to good fixes that interest him (and his loyal users). There are some developers that are experimenting with Ice Cream Sandwich builds, but I personally don't recommend them if you value stability. These devs have extended the life of this phone for me, even as I search for a replacement. I may keep this around as a spare phone/internet/music machine well after I retire it from regular use. That's how much I like my V... it's proven to be quite durable for me (and many other users, especially those who love rooting) :-)April 28, 2014 : I still have this phone in my possession. It still runs the original battery!As a rooted device, I've run at least ten different ROMs on it, ranging from Froyo, to Gingerbread (Cyanogenmod 7.2) ROMs, to even a KitKat ROM! I ran it briefly out of hibernation while waiting for the Kyocera Event (Oct. 2013), and LG Optimus F3 (April, 2014) to come to my doorstep from amazon. The current ROM I have for it is something called CyanMobile Experience. There are two versions floating around, but the one I have is made by an Android Central member named jduffield1. I'm currently hosting the file on my Google Drive account. If you want to try it for your V, go to the Android Central forums, and look for the rooting section for the Virgin Mobile Optimus V. My name there is daffy_duck_nj. I love the Jelly Bean like features duff put on this ROM! It has the reliability of the one made by mrg666, so it's very stable, even in its WIP form. The KitKat one was cool, but it kept on overheating my phone, even though I didn't push the overclocking much. Don't use that one if you want a reliable V experience.",4.0,1308096000,"06 15, 2011",LG Optimus V Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile),58.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41l1yyZuyXL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 15416},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones'], ['Sports & Outdoors', 'Fan Shop', 'Cell Phone Accessories']]"

B004LJ8N78,A12DQZKRKTNF5E,Andrea Polk,"[226, 232]","After being a T-Mobile customer for 8 years I finally dumped them when I found the phone and plan I'd been waiting for: the Android 2.2, LG Optimus V with the Beyond Talk plan.The Phone:An Android 2.2 operating system powers the LG Optimus V (V stands for Virgin... the S is Sprint's phone, but both share the Sprint mobile network) and allows for zippy web surfing via the 3G network.  Apps open quickly and transitions from one thing to another are smooth. The processor seems up to multitasking and I had no problem downloading apps and emailing at the same time.The body of the phone is comfortable to hold with a slightly rubberized feel, and the screen is bright and clear.  I did note the back cover of the phone is a tad flimsy, so be careful pulling it off and on to put in the battery.  Bear in mind I'm used to a Nokia E71 phone, which has a metal back, so that may just be something that bothered me and won't phase anyone else about this phone.  The four navigation keys on the front of the phone are sturdy and responsive.The touchscreen doesn't seem to respond as easily as my iTouch does, but then again, it may be me and the way I was gingerly giving it an initial once over.  I have texted and emailed using Swype (a cool technology included on this phone that basically allows you the ability to move your finger over a keyboard and have it intuitively guess at what you're trying to type without you lifting your finger) on this phone, and it works well. I'm pretty slow at it, but practice will undoubtedly help.The camera is a 3.2mp without a flash.  I'm not overly impressed with the quality of the photos I've taken, but I don't use my phone-cam as my primary camera anyway.  You can also take video with this phone.Charging this phone can be done by two methods: USB or travel adapter.  The travel adapter (included in the package along with the USB to phone cord) attaches to the USB end of the cord that attaches to the base of the phone.  You can charge your phone via either AC or USB - AC seemed to do it a tad faster, but be prepared to have a full recharge take 1 to 2hrs.This takes us to the downside of this phone: the battery life.  If you are downloading or surfing the web, this phone sucks down the juice.  There is a free app called Juice Defender, which will prolong your battery life - I highly recommend it along with Hotspot Widget, which allows you to use Hotspots for Wi-fi.  Talk time on the battery is estimated at 6hrs, with up to 3 days of standby time.  This would only work if you never checked the web, emailed, texted or played with apps!The phone weighs 4.69 ounces and is a tad thick, but not much more than an iPhone with a hard case on it.  It ships with a 2GB micro SD card in it, but I recommend picking up at least an 8GB card or larger to replace it.  Adding apps will quickly diminish the 2GB.No flash player is yet available for this phone - or so I've heard, thus 'flash' doesn't play on it.  You can view YouTube videos and there are several TV apps, so not really an issue for me yet and probably something that will be fixed with firmware in the future.I suggest purchasing a case to protect it, as none is included in the phone package.  LG Optimus S and T cases will work with this phone. Deals with a case, charger, screen protector, etc... like this: LG Optimus S LS670 Full Diamond Bling Black Zebra Skin Hard Case Snap on Cover Phone Protector Sleeve + Mirror LCD Screen Guard Film w/Cleaning Cloth + Free Biodegradable Screen wipe are available on Amazon.The Beyond Talk Plans:No deal out there comes close to this one.  Yes, the phone is an initial chunk of change, but it's an Android phone that will offer excellent call quality on the Sprint network and data at 3G speeds - unlimited data, text and email - for $25 a month with 300 anytime minutes.  GREAT deal!  A bump up for $40 a month gives you 1200 anytime minutes a month and unlimited data, text and email, or for $60 a month you get unlimited everything.  NO CONTRACT.  You can pay via gift cards you purchase with cash, or have a debit or credit card on file with Virgin Mobile.  You can choose to have them take the plan fee out each month, or you can tell them you'll do it yourself via the online payment section.  Really, really easy and no taxes or hidden fees.  If you go over your minutes it's an additional 10 cents a minute, and minutes don't rollover to the next month.Virgin Mobile coverage maps are available on their website.  Check it with your address to see coverage in your area prior to buying the phone.  There's a way to check voice coverage and then click over to data coverage.'Porting' Your Number (Keeping Your Old Number):If you want to keep your same cellphone number (the one used by another carrier) you need to keep these things in mind.1. You have to be in the same area code to do it.2. You cannot cancel your previous service prior to calling Virgin Mobile to set up service.3. You cannot activate your LG Optimus V on Virgin Mobile's website, you must call them to tell them you want the same number.4. You need to have your old number, account number for the other provider, and a bit of time (up to 72hrs, although it took VM only 1hr to port my number...) to switch the old number to your new phone.5. You must have your LG Optimus V charged to be able to receive a text letting you know the number has been switched and your old service has been cancelled.6. Calling your old provider to make sure your service has been cancelled and to pay off any lingering debt with them is advised.Call to 'activate' your Virgin Mobile service after the number has been ported to your new phone.  They will ask you how you are paying for your service and have you do a test call.If you don't have an old number, you can either call Virgin Mobile to activate the phone or do it on their website.The LG Optimus V phone is my first android smartphone and so far, I'm very impressed. GPS, email, web, checking in on eBay and Amazon... all very exciting and something I thought I'd never be able to afford as I couldn't justify spending $70 a month for it with T-Mobile or ATT.In a few months the purchase of this phone will pay for itself and with no contract I'm sure I'll feel good about having the option to change, even if I never do.  If you don't want to be under contract, but want to enjoy the perks of new technology at a reasonable price per month - get this phone and the Beyond Talk plan. Heck, get them for the entire family!  You won't regret the purchase.UPDATE: March 13, 2011Found several FREE apps in the 'Market' of note.1. ShopSavy: uses scanner technology to scan items in the store and then give you the best price for that item online or locally.  Works very well!2. GasBuddy: gives you the current prices on fuel at different grades.  Type in a zip code or name of a place to get the listings.  You can also add a price as you see it to assist others using the app.3. Speed Test : gives you the current speeds of your internet upload and download.  Noted that my wifi is much, much faster than the 3G network, thus when home I switch my settings from mobile to wifi.4. Amazon Kindle: read all content on your Kindle, also on your phone.5. Radar Now: shows current weather maps as shown on your TV weather report (satellite maps) in real time, via GPS.6. HP Photo Print: found my home network printers and printed photos taken on my phone after uploading to the printer via this app.  Also can use Photoshop Express (also free) to tweak the photo prior to printing.7. SilentBoot: once downloaded an on, this allows you to turn your phone on and off without any noise.8. AVG free antivirus: still a good idea to run an antivirus whether it's on your PC or phone.9. Google Sky: really fun app that shows you the night sky (stars, constellations) and moves with you according to GPS location... play with this one!10. Quick Settings: very easy way to turn on and off wifi/gps/mobile... and a host of other things like uninstalling apps you no longer want.11. Zedge: lots n' lots of wallpapers and ringtones for free.12. Memory Booster lite: frees up unused memory to use by the processor.13. JuiceDefender: runs in the background to save your battery from draining too quickly.14. World Newspapers: just like the title implies, access to worldwide news via newspapers, but also magazines, webnews, social networking, etc... fun to browse and in many, many languages.15. Tune In Radio: allows you to pick up radio stations and podcasts by state. The 3.5mm headset jack (standard - like on iPods and other MP3 players) is great and this app plus your music library on a SD card means you can choose to leave your music player at home as it's all on your phone!Battery drops quickly with a lot of app use, but without it the phone holds a good charge for several days.  I simply keep topping the battery up whenever I'm home and near the charger. The manual says not to let the battery be completely discharged.Also on the subject of 'battery': The battery also is somewhat loose in my phone.  Not sure if that's all Optimus V's or just mine.  Sometimes my screen goes black and it's a loose battery.  A small bit of tape fixed the problem and is unseen under the back cover of the phone.The Voice Recognition software on this phone seems to be fabulous!  Both voice dialing and voice input for texting (instead of typing) seem to work great for me.  One suggestion for texting via voice: make your sentences short.  This seems to give me the most accurate input.Overall I love this phone and look forward to using it and Virgin Mobile for a long time!  Call clarity is great and so far the Android Experience is all I would have wished it to be.  I've watched lots of YouTube videos, emailed, msg'd, all with great ease.  The calls have been clear on both the sending and receiving end, and I've yet to find an area where I have not had service.  That's a pretty big deal considering I don't live in a major metropolitan area.  Great find, and happily discovering new things I like about the phone every day.UPDATE: 9/27/11Phone continues to give great service, but occasionally freezes when trying to dial.  I end up taking the battery out and reseating it, which seems to solve the problem. Did I mention you can't turn the phone off either? I'm considering a new battery for it...can get it off of Amazon for about $13.Anker 1600mAh Li-ion Battery for LG Optimus V VM670 (Virgin), LG Optimus S LS670(Sprint), Optimus One P500, Optimus T, Optimus U, Optimus C LW690, Optimus M MS690 Fits LGIP-400N - WhiteService for the phone has gone up in price from $25 a mo to $35 a mo for 300 minutes with unlimited talk and text.  Fortunately for me, as I got in with the $25 plan, my price DID NOT go up.  Thought that was darned nice of Virgin Mobile!  Hope it lasts.UPDATE: 1/25/12Received a text from Virgin Mobile today informing me that Internet speeds would be reduced for Beyond Talk customers if they go over 2.5GB of useage per month.  The Internet speeds for 3G with Virgin Mobile have been spotty lately, which makes me wonder if that's part of a transition to this new policy.  Time will tell if I will stay with Virgin Mobile or switch to something else. I don't use much data, but it bums me out that Virgin Mobile is going the way of several other providers and doing this now.  The phone is still a good one, and the plan is good for the money, but definitely not for those who don't want to wait too long for Facebook to load!UPDATE: 8/29/12Over the past two months or so the LG Optimus V has been acting fussy. The touchscreen became less responsive, sometimes the phone wouldn't turn off, and hanging up from a call became impossible without taking out the battery!  I have been very gentle with the phone and it's only been dropped twice, while wearing an Otterbox case.  3G speeds are excellent in the right location, but terrible in others.  I don't blame the phone for that one.I read a bunch of phone reviews and decided that for my budget, Virgin Mobile is still the best deal out there next to Tracfone which has such a poor phone offering I can't convince myself to jump ship.  Today I purchased theHTC One V Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile)and can activate it with my current number online, once I log in to my Virgin Mobile account.  I chose the One over theHTC EVO V 4G Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile)because the EVO is $100 more and I don't have 4G coverage in my area, so paying for that option when I can't use it seemed wrong for me.I will update again when I activate (I'm waiting for Amazon to ship myOtterBox 77-20718 Commuter Series Hybrid Case for HTC One V - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Blackbefore I do so.  I'm optimistic that the LG issues will not be present on the HTC phone, and since the LG Optimus V has been replaced in the line-up with theLG Optimus Elite Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile)which gets so-so reviews, I feel good about this new purchase.I'll also let you know if a phone call to Virgin Mobile won't help me keep my grandfathered in $25 a month with the new phone.  Fingers crossed!UPDATE: 12/2712Been using theHTC One V Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile)for about 4 months now - had to upgrade to $35 plan to get it to work - and I love it!  It's a huge step up from the LG Optimus in both speed and features.

B004LJ8N78,A5T1AJ2TYYT2U,David Johnson,"[0, 0]","This is my first Android phone, and I just got it a few days ago, so take my review with a grain of salt. So far I am very happy with it.PROS3G and Wifi - My previous phone was a Kyocera Loft. That was fine for doing things like occasionally checking E-Mail and Facebook, but it was through a painfully slow connection. The Optimus is a HUGE improvement over that. The 3G is great, and when it uses wifi the connection is instantaneous. I can now use things like Pandora and Youtube, which were impossible on my old phone.Android 2.2 - Like I said, I don't have much of a frame of reference since this is my first Android phone, but Android 2.2 seems fairly intuitive and easy to navigate.Swype text entry - This makes typing on the phone go so much faster. You just slide your finger from letter to letter on the touch screen, and it automatically figures out what you were typing. It works great!Price - This phone might be priced as an ""entry level"" Android phone, but I have two friends who are also on Virgin Mobile and they both had this phone as their first Android phone. One of them upgraded to the Motorola Triumph and one upgraded to the HTC Wildfire. They both said they miss the Optimus, and that they got fooled into thinking that a more expensive phone would be better. They also both have plans to go back to the Optimus. I should note here that I bought mine at Radio Shack for about $30 more than the Amazon price. I had thought that Virgin fixed the price of their phones so that they cost the same wherever you buy them, but I guess I was wrong about that. It was still a good deal at $30 more.CONSBattery Life - I have really been putting this phone through its paces, streaming videos and music, playing games, etc., and so far I have to charge it every day. At my level of usage, I am thinking it might be beneficial to upgrade to the extended life battery.Apps stuck in phone memory - If it were up to me, I would move everything to the SD card, but I can't. There are lots of apps that are stuck in the phone memory, including some that I downloaded! I don't know how much memory the phone started with, but it is down to 78MB and I am concerned that I am going to fill it up. At that point, I guess I will just have to delete some of my apps. It would be nice if the downloader automatically gave an option of where to install an app, and even nicer if the app management tool allowed all apps to be moved to the SD card.Button backlight timer not configurable - This is not a huge deal, but the timer for the button backlights is set at around five seconds and there is no option to configure that time. It's not a huge deal until you are using the phone in the dark and then you have to feel around for the buttons.Lock-up - This might be related to an app and not the phone, but when I am using the streaming app for my favorite sports talk station the phone will lock up if the 3G signal drops off. The only way to recover from that seems to be to remove the battery and re-boot the phone.If Amazon would allow half stars, I would give this phone 4.5 stars for almost perfect. I am very happy with it, and the cons are easy to live with.",4.0,1326672000,"01 16, 2012",LG Optimus V Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile),58.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41l1yyZuyXL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 15416},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones'], ['Sports & Outdoors', 'Fan Shop', 'Cell Phone Accessories']]"
B004LJ8N78,A6431R3HYL004,Dayton,"[2, 2]","----October 13, 2012 update----This phone seems to be rapidly deteriorating. The screen and buttons frequently become non-responsive. If I'm reading a newspaper app I can typically get through a few articles before it gets stuck and I have to take the battery out. When it gets stuck the power button doesn't do anything.----June 8, 2012 update---Space on the phone's internal memory ran out on me so I've moved my apps to the SD card. This definitely decreases the stability of the phone. Sometimes the icons will all turn into the stock android app icon and when I click on any of them the message ""this application is not installed on your phone"" comes up. Sometimes the problem resolves itself after a few seconds, but sometimes I get impatient and restart the phone. Maybe it would always fix itself if I waited long enough. Also, the phone seems to freeze more often than it did before. I end up taking the battery out about once a day. It seems that when it freezes up the power button is useless so you can't restart it without cutting the power. I still like it overall, but I'm feeling the difference between this and an iPhone more than I was before.-----original review-------After being an iPhone user for 4 years, this phone is not as much worse as I expected. Here are the differences I have found to be meaningful after a few weeks:-Screen size: The 0.3 inch difference in screen size between this and the iPhone sounded negligible to me, but I have found that it is much harder to type on this phone, using either of the preloaded keyboards or downloading others that claim to be better. Also, most Android apps are clearly optimized for a larger screen. Not infrequently I come across pages where you need to type something and find that when the keyboard opens up the only thing I can see is the header on the app or webpage, so I can't actually see what I'm typing. This difficulty compounds the super narrow keys on the keyboard.-Stability: In the first few weeks it has frozen a couple times such that the only thing I can do to get it to respond is to take out the battery and put it back in. Other things crash maybe once a day, not enough to annoy me.-Battery life: I speak on the phone very little, but I have some app or other open and use the internet and GPS quite a bit. A couple of times it has died on me late in the day after I'm already home, but usually it has a few percent at least left. If you plan to talk on the phone a lot or for some reason find it inconvenient to charge it up every night the battery life would be a problem.-Voicemail: I'm not sure if this is because of the phone or Virgin Mobile, but you have to call your voicemail to get your messages and go through that painfully slow old-fashioned system of listening to the computer voice tell you the number of messages, the phone numbers, when the call was, etc. This is much less convenient than having all your messages listed on a screen where you can see the time and name or number to play or delete with the touch of a button.Other than that, all my thoughts about the phone have more to do with Android vs. iOS rather than the Optimus V itself. This phone is clearly not as luxurious as an iPhone or a much more expensive Android phone. It is a great way to save money by trading down or a cheap way to trade up from a not-so-smartphone.One last note: get the GrooveIP app and a Google Voice number. You can place and receive all your calls over the data network with your unlimited data plan instead of using your very limited minutes. I use 90% of my minutes with my girlfriend so I only had to give her my Google Voice number and have plenty of minutes for other people who call me. The voice quality is a little bit tinnier and washed out than over a regular call, but it's not a big difference. The biggest problem is that there's about a 2 second round-trip lag (if I say something and am on speakerphone I don't hear my echo for about that long, is what I mean). You have to learn a hint of patience so you don't end up talking over the other person.I'd rather have an iPhone, but I'd rather rather save $1,400 over the course of two years.",3.0,1335744000,"04 30, 2012",LG Optimus V Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile),58.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41l1yyZuyXL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 15416},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones'], ['Sports & Outdoors', 'Fan Shop', 'Cell Phone Accessories']]"

That's a hardship for low income users: students, disabled, seniors, etc. Add taxes and fees to it, and it's ridiculous....Phone is too small to read many/most online info, so a browser is useless. Enlarging the text, when possible, means sliding the viewable space all over with a finger. Try to keep track of what you just saw! Likewise social media like Youtube and FB. And, these apps run slow, hog memory, and are laid out differently for the phone than on pc. Again, more annoyance than bliss.I like the navigator app. It is very useful, but drains the battery fast.

B004LJ8N78,A130VKD6760TV5,GoodNoodle,"[0, 0]","This is not a bad phone by any stretch.  It's my very first ""smartphone"" type of phone, but I still found the learning curve to be very brief and I was master of my new phone in no time.  I do the $35 monthly plan, which is fine for my needs. I don't talk on the phone much, but I like accessing the internet from time to time with wireless.  I get good service, rarely drop a call, and all in all I'm pretty happy with it.  I can, however, see some problems that a more savvy user would not tolerate.  The wireless/internet I believe is 3G.  It can be slower than molasses.  You can watch Netflix and check facebook and such if you've got a good connection, but the average ""free"" wireless hotspot is not going to let you do anything without a fight.  My second complaint is the battery life is really quite bad.  It's not bad at ALL if you're just using it as a phone.  It keeps its charge pretty well, and I've left it for a couple of days and it was still fine.  The trouble comes when you do ANY sort of ""playing around"" on it.  It drains that battery dry so quick, you don't even know what happened. You're in the green one minute, it's shutting itself down the next. There is also some glitching issues where a random sound will play on a loop constantly until I reset it. I believe it's a ""facebook pop"".

Now, seven months later, we feel great about our first smartphone purchases.We don't live in an area with 4G coverage (southern Oregon), so there was little reason to commit to a two-year plan. We have 3G connectivity and the Android 2.2 operating system, featuring a 3.2"" QVGA touchscreen display (480 x 320 pixels).A nice surprise is the Amazon App store, where we purchase most of our apps. We have nothing against Android market but the prices are usually better at Amazon and we can test many of the apps before purchasing them. We upgraded from the 2 GB microSD memory card included to a 16 GB card. We recommend you upgrade as well, so you can enjoy the apps without worrying about overloading your phone.The only feature we don't have (and really want) is a flash for the 3.2-megapixel auto-focus camera/camcorder. That's really the only complaint we have with this model.My Google, Yahoo and Hotmail accounts are linked to theLG Optimus V. My most used apps are Google Listen and BeyondPod, both of which give me access to a wide variety of podcasts, music and news. I've also downloaded my cardio playlist from the Amazon Cloud.The phone comes with a 3.5mm headset/headphone jack. I regularly use both myUltimate Ears 200 Noise-Isolating Earphonesand myJabra Sport corded Stereo Sports Headset. I'm happy with the sound quality and volume.In summary, the lack of a flash is not enough for me to drop a star off my rating. I hope my next smartphone purchase is as good a value as this one.

B004LJ8N78,A3I04RM049YS8Y,Jeffrey Stanley,"[1, 1]","Before I go further, the biggest drawback of this phone is battery life. It is difficult to get through a light-use day on a charge. It should have never been released with its battery issues. I'll never buy another LG product considering how little weight they give to usability.If you can put up with mid-day charging, it is a decent value. The voice search works great. It's easy to use. The touch screen is responsive. The dialer app works great. The OS is responsive and will multitask and switch apps with ease.The browser is usable but the screen is pretty tiny. It works in a pinch but you shouldn't buy it if you are a heavy web user.Text entry isn't great. It's much better in landscape mode, but still no where nearly as accurate as iPhone. If you are a heavy texter or emailer I'd suggest that you consider a virgin blackberry instead.The email app lacks sorting and searching ability. Because of this, it is a pretty terrible business phone. I'm kind of shocked that anyone would buy a business phone running android OS because of the weak email app.Simple games work fine. I play solitaire on it from time to time. Don't expect angry birds or other animated games to work well. It will not replace a pocket game system.It falls short in too many ways. I like Virgin and think they deliver a lot for what they charge, but I wish I would have bought a Blackberry instead. Blackberry is the only Virgin phone with a proven track record for good hardware and software.

B004LJ8N78,A1ZU55TM45Y2R8,J. Haggard,"[35, 36]","I've been an apple user since the iPhone 3G came out. Loved that thing and in fact I still do. But over the years it's gotten slower and I'm not ready to re-commit to a 2 year contract. I wanted a smart phone with no contract and a reasonable monthly rate. After a lot of checking I opted for the Virgin Mobile prepaid, and the LG Optimus.From a value standpoint, I purchased this phone for $100 at bestbuy on sale. And the monthly plan is a mere $25 instead of the $50-$90 I was spending on the iphone 3G. You can't beat a $25 a month phone bill for unlimited data, text and 300 minutes. If you need more minutes you can switch to a $40 or $60 plan but for me $25 is enough.The phone itself is pretty darn fast compared to my iPhone 3G. Some people say you can't do angry birds on it, I haven't had any trouble. It does take a minute to load the game, but it's not an unreasonable amount of time.The animations on the phone are smooth and the call quality isn't great but is acceptable.The GPS is incredible. When using Google maps on my iphone (and ipad 3g) I am juust a little blue dot. When running the same app on this phone I'm an arrow and it knows what direction I'm facing, something iOS doesn't do. Plus I am loving Google Goggles and barcode scanner. The camera is decent quality and it's just really well done.The only downside to this phone is Virgin installs some crapware that you can't remove unless you root the device. I'm not going to do that but I will download pro launcher or something that will allow me to hide the extra apps I don't want.Oh and one more con, itunes sync on a mac. Pretty much non-existent. You can use an app called doubletwist and it does an ok job at syncing playlists, but unless your media is in a playlist it won't sync up. I'm still looking for an alternative tool.Overall I am just as happy with this entry level android phone running 2.2 as I was with my iPhone 3g running the latest apple iOS. In fact this phone is able to do MORE then my iphone 3G even after jailbreaking it.And I'm really loving VirginMobiles $25 a month plan, so much in fact that I don't think I would EVER go back to a 2 year contract apple phone with minimum plan price points upwards of $40-$90 or whatever it is these days.Here's a promo code when you sign up with Virgin Mobile, you can get 60 MINUTES FREE by entering RYnDPLOU in the kickbacks box when you activate your phone. Minimum of $20 is required. Note: Enter this code when you active NOT when you buy the phone--UPDATE--I am now using an app called iSyncr to sync my iTunes and Android phone. It does a MUCH better job in my opinion then DoubleTwist because it doesn't make it's own library of music. It instead syncs directly from your itunes library folders. I also paid the $0.99 for the WIFI addon which now lets me sync my music, tv shows, podcasts, etc without being connected to my computer. Now because the battery isn't all that wonderful I leave it plugged in on my nightstand when I sync wireless. But this means now when I go to bed I hit the wifi sync and go to sleep. When I wake up all my latest podcasts, etc are ready to go with me.

I get 300 minutes all for $25 a month, no contract, no start up and if I happen to go over I have top up cash that covers me and also pays for any Android apps I may want.

B004LJ8N78,A2BH8KZRJDJD3Z,M. Harris,"[9, 9]","First off let me say that I've had quite a relationship with this phone. I've had ups and downs with it all the time. Here are some important points:1. The Screen - While it may not have the beauty of other phones, it certainly isn't hard to look at. The colors are all very nice, even the blacks are decent for a phone this price. It looks quite nice in the dark especially. The colors are warm, but not overly warm. There is no certain tint to the color, which is something that some high-end phones are missing. Reading is bearable on it, I had no problem reading long amounts of text at all. The pixels are visible, but if you don't look for them, you don't notice them. Actually, they are not that visible, much better than a lot of screens I've seen. While the screen is small compared to a lot of phones, in fact tiny, it's not horrible. But, if you plan on doing a lot of web browsing or movie-watching especially, then you will really enjoy a bigger screen. Even games. So, that is one major limitation of this phone.2. The Speed - A major problem with this phone is speed. Maybe several years ago, this would be considered fast. But nowadays, it's been left in the dust by dual-core processors, quad-core even. This clocks in at 600 MHz single-core. Ouch! Phones usually have at least 1.2 GHz dual-core. And you will see the difference immediately. Applications sometimes open very slowly, things that you would think should be flawless. A lot of times, even if all background programs are closed (I use Advanced Task Killer - works like a charm most of the time, greatly improves performance) the lock screen can freeze up at times. Sometimes that can make the phone unusable, but luckily you just wait a few seconds and it catches itself up. When browsing desktop-sized websites, there can be MAJOR freeze-ups. A lot of times, the status bar keeps saying that something is loading, which it is. But it's only loading one object many times. Because of that one object that refuses to load, the page looks all messed up. And since the browser doesn't have flash, there are a lot of times when things refuse to load. If you're going to browse especially picture-heavy sites like Engadget, good luck! It's a stuttering nightmare even after you wait a while after the page is fully loaded. So be patient if you want to do that kind of web browsing. Mobile sites, however, don't have a problem at all usually, but even they lack the smoothness they should have. When it comes to playing games, there is a lot of stuttering (lag) as well. Most games have at least a little, and many games like Temple Run cannot even be played on this phone due to its slow processor. What I just listed is not even close to all of the limitations the processor creates.3. The Battery - You would think a phone that doesn't have much speed would be a battery-saver. You would think it wouldn't use much energy. Well folks, you're sadly mistaken, and because of the fact that the processor has to work so hard to do the simplest of things, the battery life can be very short. It's enough to get through the day, depending on how much you use it. But trust me, I've come close to fully draining the battery a lot of times. Hooking up WiFi instead of its 3G connection is a major power saver, so you might want to consider that. It's easy enough to do. But on 3G, it drains like crazy.4. The network - All of Virgin Mobile's phones work on Sprint's network. While Sprint has been around for a long time, they still don't have a decent network built up. The speeds are atrocious sometimes, and coverage, oh boy, that's even worse. I found out that the speeds are always less than 1MBPS. Networks like AT&T; can get far better speeds, on 3G. This phone has no 4G, so that's yet ANOTHER limitation. However, even though those numbers are low, it's not the worst. Pages tend to be fast. They are usually close to WiFi. But downloads on WiFi are SO much faster. And in my home, even though I live in a decent-size city, has poor coverage. I used to have a Net10 phone, which runs off of AT&T; and T-Mobile's network, which was faster. What a shame. Sprint's network is just so unstable. For a while, I used to have no service in my home. At least now that's fixed, I guess.There are more limitations than what I listed, but there is one thing that everyone, including me, has to remember. The monthly bill is only $35. That's lower than any other carrier, so the saying, ""You get what you paid for"" works well here. So, I guess for such a great price I can't complain much. But if you're coming from contract, or like me looking to go onto contract, you will probably be disappointed if you purchase this phone, or for that matter any phone from Virgin Mobile.Overall, I still manage to get some use out of the phone. And by the way, it has a low memory capacity (internal) which is another major setback. A lot of times, a message comes up saying it's low. It's a major annoyance, so some more memory would be wonderful. But now that I've taken out a lot of apps and games, it works well for the most part. I can't wait to move onto something better though.",3.0,1330819200,"03 4, 2012",LG Optimus V Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile),58.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41l1yyZuyXL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 15416},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones'], ['Sports & Outdoors', 'Fan Shop', 'Cell Phone Accessories']]"

I was paying my parents $30 a month (for my own data use) and they covered the rest. My girlfriend had her own verizon plan but it was costing her $80 a month!! without a smartphone! She switched to VM, with the HTC Wildfire...soon after I joined her on VM in an attempt to become more independent from my parents.The day I recieved it, I activated it, transfered my verizon number, rooted and flashed cyanogenmod onto it in less than 24 hours. The number transfer took less than an hour for mine and my GFs, the root took about a half hour. I had never even attempted flashing with my Incredible. With this phone, it was super easy but very nerve wrecking lol (thinking you bricked your brand new $100 phone). Now, with cyanogenmod, its 10x better than my incredible. CPU downclocking when its not in use saves TONS of battery, awesome screen effects, everything looks and runs very well. Going from a 1ghz snapdragon to this with cyanogenmod; the change is barely noticeable.Phone : It doesnt have an FM radio. I wish it did cause I listen to the radio a lot. No camera flash either, meaning no flashlight app (I used this often on my incredible). Poor but acceptable quality camera. Physical keys can be annoying. Screen is NOT glass.

B004LJ8N78,A2BAWLYA43PJYN,Mr. Staack,"[5, 5]","I'm a long-time Virgin Mobile customer, and have always elected to own very spartan phones.  My work and social life didn't require anything fancier, and the simpler phones generally held up better than my colleagues smart phones.  However, after expanding my business, it's become necessary to own an Android smartphone that enables me to conduct my everyday duties.  As well, it would be nice to own a fun handset.I did a lot of research, comparing cellular carriers in my area (particularly the Chicagoland suburbs), and it turned out Virgin Mobile - with the LG Optimus V smartphone - was just perfect for me.  Virgin Mobile, using Sprint's network as its backbone, has always provided great coverage in and around the cities and states I work in.  For service, I signed up for the $25/month service.  300 anytime talk minutes and unlimited data and text suits me just fine.  I've never gotten close to my limit.  Virgin Mobile throttles 3G data after a 2GB cap, but I've never gotten close to that (I rely on encrypted wi-fi in most of my offices).  As a Virgin Mobile customer for years, and I've always been pleased with their cellular service, and their customer service.  I'm paying less than most of my friends, however I feel I get comparable service - sometimes even better service (especially the poor souls with AT&T;, who can't get a dependable signal in the Chicago Loop area).  The 3G download and upload speeds are comparable to other 3G service in my area.  I average 2000 kb/s, at home, and get even faster speeds in downtown Chicago.  An added bonus with Virgin Mobile's no-contract service, is that I'm not locked into some draconian service plan.  Nice!My roommate and several of my pals have the T-Mobile G2X (a.k.a., the Optimus 2X), and the Optimus V compares quite favorably.  While the more-expensive G2X has a nicer camera, LED flash bulb, a slightly nicer screen, more internal memory and a faster CPU...  Truthfully, I think the Optimus V is only just slightly less awesome than the G2X.  And, in the areas where the Optimus V are weaker, they really don't faze me.  I don't need a powerhouse phone - but even when I'm playing games or editing photos, I feel like the Qualcomm 600 MHz CPU holds up just fine.  It's still the most powerful phone I've owned, and is no slouch against other same-generation smartphones I've used.The Optimus V and very open Android Froyo 2.2.1 OS, really does suit my needs quite perfectly.  I can run the latest builds of Opera Mobile, TeamViewer (remote control software), Square with the little credit card reader, Hulu Plus, Netflix movies, Avast Antivirus, MyBackup Pro, Facebook, Cerberus (tracking software), PDF and e-book reader, Springpad, RadioReference Scanner Radio, Groundspeak geocaching app, MortPlayer multi-format music player, Zedge, multi-format QQPlayer for videos, WiGLE war driving, and many other apps - including the occasional game and augmented reality apps.  Additional perks are Google Suite integration, Gmail, Google Contact, Google Calendar, YouTube videos, Google Maps, and Google GPS Navigation.  The Android operating systems makes it super-easy to customize.  Custom wallpapers, ringtones, alarm clocks, animated screen savers, advanced launchers, custom security lockout screens and more are available online.  There really isn't any part of this phone I can't customize to my liking, WITHOUT having to root it (which I hear is fairly easy).It's a fine form factor - 113.5 mm (4.47 in) tall, 59 mm (2.3 in) wide, and 13.3 mm (0.52 in) thick.  With the stock 1500 mAh battery, it weighs a comfortable 129 g (4.6 oz).  The battery life is a little better than the G2X under similar usage, and there are higher-capacity batteries available.  As well, there are a ton of accessories available for the Optimus V.  With a little shopping around, I found numerous cases, screen protection, charges, data cables - all for super cheap.  I added in a 32GB micro SDHC card, and it instantly recognized it.  Connected to my computer, via USB micro cable, it was instantly recognized and mounted on Windows XP, Vista, and Win7.  After months of daily usage, after loading a myriad of apps, I haven't had any major crashes.  The touchscreen is very precise and sensitive, allowing for complex actions and quick typing (I've since started using Swype).  The speakers and mic are pretty good, with no complaints about call quality.  The voice recognition works really well, either with the built in microphone or using a headset.  The external jack works fine, though I only use it for the Square card reader.  For hands free, I use a Bluetooth headset - all of which, I was able to easily pair up.  All of the buttons are sturdy, and offer a satisfying click when pressed.  After months of use, the buttons still feel good as new.  The camera isn't too shabby in adequate light, either, with automatic geotagging.  Video recording is also quite good, for a phone.  A feature that comes in real handy, is that you can use the phone as a mobile hotspot, with the use of a free app.  This really is a well-designed handset, and never seems to freeze or crash, after months of extensive use.Am I the envy of owners of Apple iHype products or state-of-the-art Android handsets?  Doubt it.  Virgin Mobile may not be the sexiest of service providers, and the LG Optimus V isn't the most vogue handset.  Do I care?  Heck no!  Honestly, I'm PROUD to own a phone that is reasonably powerful, stable, energy efficient, and bargain priced.

In my opinion this is the best app for the task. Just make sure you set the right apps to be stopped. Nothing worthwhile is easy.The screen is bright and websites look beautiful. The only problem I have with this smartphone as well with any other touchscreen (including, er, iphone) is that the touchscreen keyboard SUCKS. It doesn't matter what people say, it is not easy to use a touchscreen keyboard, and it takes a big chunk of the screen. So, I'm letting this smartphone go, and I will get the Samsung Intercept which has a slide out keyboard, the way nature intended with REAL keys.Even though it doesn't have a dedicated graphics processor, I don't care, since I don't play video games much.One thing I forgot is that the Optimus V plays videogames fluidly, including angry birds and racing games, but playing video games on a touchscreen is not the way nature intended.

NO! for the whole city there are but a handful of towers and only 2 or 3 in brooklyn. had i known virgin mobile performed this poorly in a big city like this i never would have subscribed to their service. you can not surf in the comfort of your own home,at least not where i live. you have to go out in the open to get a decent signal to surf. even the so called 3G signal is slow and spotty,at best.overall the phone does not have enough internal memory, its battery life even with software like green power premium will only last two days without use. and four hours with use. without green power premium, the battery won't last even a day. apps for the phone are slow to launch and sometimes freeze up and stop working. virgin mobile's 3G service should be ranked DEAD LAST. because in a city as large as mine you should at minimum watch a youtube video without it stopping to buffer countless times. i would not recommend using this phone or the virgin mobile service.",1.0,1342224000,"07 14, 2012",LG Optimus V Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile),58.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41l1yyZuyXL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 15416},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones'], ['Sports & Outdoors', 'Fan Shop', 'Cell Phone Accessories']]"

B004LJ8N78,AGOWZ7HPTOTHQ,Saren,"[4, 4]","The LG Optimus V (part of the ONE series) is an excellent starter phone for Android. With Virgin, you also get excellent data speeds and call quality. On top of that, its only $35 a month... Beat that, other carriers! The Optimus is an excellent Android phone for starters, and is arguably the best phone on Virgin's lineup (the Triumph and Optimus Slider are also very good phones).The phone itself is made very well and is solid, with a rubbery plastic shell, but I put a caseOtterBox Commuter Case for LG Optimus - Black - Retail Packagingon it just for peace of mind.The 3.2 inch screen is bright and vivid. Although it is by no means cramped, the screen is a bit on the smaller side. Swype is nice once you get used to it, but I still prefer a regular keyboard to swiping. Quite surprisingly, I made very few mistakes while typing in portrait mode, and I have large-medium sized hands. I use landscape mode most of the time for typing, though, where the keys are much larger.The stock Android 2.2 (READ: no overlay interface) is very user-friendly. I have used many mobile OSes, and I would have to say that Android is probably my favorite. Plus, the Optimus One series are all being updated to 2.3, so let's hope Virgin gives us the 2.3 update.The network/3G data speeds are normally very fast and the call quality is great as well (no dropped calls... Yet). Virgin uses Sprint's cell towers/network for data and voice service, but, unlike Sprint phones, Virgin cannot roam on to other CDMA carriers like Verizon. That means that if you leave a Sprint area, you are stuck without service until you reenter a Sprint coverage area. Before buying, make sure you live in an area that Virgin reaches (you can check on their website)The phone's 600Mhz processor sounds slow in comparison to newer phones, yet it handles multitasking and all of my apps just fine with the occasional slowdown. Speaking of apps, there are plenty available on the Android Market.The 3.2MP camera works very well in both low and outdoor lighting conditions. The camera button on the side is a two-stage button: press slightly for autofocus, press all the way in to take the picture.The phone comes with a 2GB MicroSD card, but I upgraded to an 8GB Class 6 (aTranscend  8 GB microSDHC Class 6 Flash Memory Card TS8GUSDHC6E), which increases access speed to the SD card. The internal memory on the phone is very low, and the NON REMOVABLE bloatware only limits the number of apps you can have (even if you move them to the SD)... Probably the worst part about the phone. The only way to get rid of the apps is if you Root the phone, but I don't want to mess around with it.With a task killing app and battery-saving settings, I get exactly 2 days of battery with medium use, which is great for an Android phone. If I barely use the phone, I can even get 3 days off of it!",5.0,1331164800,"03 8, 2012",LG Optimus V Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile),58.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41l1yyZuyXL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 15416},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones'], ['Sports & Outdoors', 'Fan Shop', 'Cell Phone Accessories']]"

I can't comment on customer support because I have had no problems with the phone or the cell service after 3 months of use.The size is just perfect so it still looks like a phone when you have it up to your ear and not like a mini tablet that you have next to your face. It feels good in the hand, although I will probably get a case because I have big hands and would like a bit more grip.The processor is more than fast enough to do PHONE related tasks - music, email, web, calls, multitasking. You are not going to be playing high end games on this thing. It opens and closes all apps really fast and allows me to bounce around between them with no lag.Battery life was initially pretty bad only lasting about 4 to 6 hours with heavy use, but I installed an app called ""JuiceDefender"" and now this phone goes all day with 30% left.

Generally speaking, I've found that Virgin's 'high end' devices weren't really worth the expense- their advanced features tended to be poorly suited to their pay-as-you-go billing system, no cheaper than contract phones on their monthly plans, and just plain buggy.VM's new monthly plans and handsets, however, made me shell it out for yet another try. The main reason was devices like the Optimus V, which have a proven track record on Sprint (which Virgin runs on), T-mobile, and others. I'd also been getting tired of being made fun of with my beat-up old Samsung M340 which had never been too great in the call quality department anyhow. The Optimus V is an entry-level Android smartphone with full touchscreen control and the ability to run most apps. Among other features (which you can look up here or on VM's site) it has an external SD card slot, 3.2 MP camera, motion sensor, and rear speakerphone. It also comes with a basic wired headset, which you can replace with most third party (including bluetooth) earpieces.The biggest draw for the Optimus V, and Virgin in general, is cost. Rates start at $25 a month for unlimited data, texting, and 300 minutes. You can restart this whenever you want, so if you run out of minutes before a month is up you can just start the next month (so to speak) by paying another $25. For those that spend way more time using mobile web/email and texting than talking, this is an insanely good deal. Furthermore- and probably best of all- you are under no contractual obligations, which means if you cancel your plan (essentially, stop paying) you don't get hit with an ETF. This does mean you have to pay the full price of the handset, but the flexibility is worth it.It's worth noting, before delving into the pros and cons of the device itself, that there has been a very serious- borderline dealbreaker- technical issue with the Optimus V. In many areas, including mine, the phone would randomly drop its 3G connection and fail to reconnect. When this happened it wouldn't give any indication that something was wrong- the only way you could tell was by trying to send or receive data, which would time out. This was a big problem because if you have background data on, it would be madly attempting to retry transfer, which would eat up the battery like crazy- sometimes in 2 hours from a full charge. You have to manually toggle the device's mobile network to restore it. This issue seems to have been resolved recently in my area, but be warned that others have reported still having it. Google ""optimus v 3g drops"" if you want to learn more.Pros:Call quality is excellent, much better than any previous Virgin device I've used.Screen is superb in resolution and clarity, decent even in sunlight, and very responsive to touch and gestures. Typing on the virtual keyboard is no problem.The device is quite powerful for an entry-level smartphone and can run most apps smoothly.The build and housing are well done with a nice, solid feel and rubberized grip. It feels like it can take a few licks, and it has in my possession.Standard Google apps, such as maps/navigation, gmail, calendar, news/weather all work seamlessly. I've found this is a worthy replacement for my old Garmin GPS and serves as a better scheduling reminder than desktop web versions of Google Apps. Contacts and events sync between both automatically, so you can enter information wherever you want.Between the installed apps and stuff you can download for free, you can use this phone for pretty much anything you'd care to. It has all the basic utility features as well: decent mp3 player, email, calculator, alarm clock, browser, and chat. While it's no iPhone killer, you can do every basic task that higher end smartphones can tackle.You can root it (at your own risk) and use 3rd party apps that enable things like the mobile hotspot, which works decently. While Sprint's EVDO network might not be the latest and greatest in speed, it's plenty fast enough for web browsing.Cons:Flash doesn't work on this handset, and as far as I know there's no way to hack it (at least not for free) yet.Since the speakerphone is rear-mounted, it can be hard to hear if you put the phone down with the screen facing upwards. This means you're forced to place it face down, which is somewhat awkward seeing as how all the controls are on the front.Battery life is so-so, even after the glitch with the 3G drops was resolved. I usually have to charge it every other day with only moderate use. If you use the phone frequently or take frequent calls, expect to have to charge it daily. A car charger is recommended, and you can find some cheap ones that do the trick right here on Amazon.The motion sensor is a bit flaky, enough so that I just turned it off. The phone often fails to detect that it's been turned to landscape or portrait mode or, probably worse, sometimes falsely detects it has been reoriented. It has no sense of up or down, so if you wake it up in landscape mode it'll still show in portrait.The camera takes mediocre pictures, especially if you zoom. It doesn't focus too well by itself, so unless the subject is at ideal range and with ideal lighting, don't expect awesome results. Video is likewise unimpressive.The Optimus V is easily the best handset in Virgin's lineup and a very inexpensive and capable device. I heartily recommend it if you're at all interested in getting into the smartphone craze, yet don't want to pay out your children's inheritance in the process.",5.0,1308960000,"06 25, 2011",LG Optimus V Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile),58.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41l1yyZuyXL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 15416},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones'], ['Sports & Outdoors', 'Fan Shop', 'Cell Phone Accessories']]"

B004PEWPCI,A2NZCRHLTFKKCB,G. Denny,"[0, 1]","First, let's set the record straight. I've read many reviews where people say this is a smart phone and it really isn't. It may be smarter than some phones, but it is no where near an iPhone 4s or other android devices. The people that are saying that they see no reason to spend money on a smart phone have obviously never owned a smart phone. That being said, this phone is feature laden for the price and does most things well.The price is great, the monthly plans are an excellent value, but the only thing I really, really hate about this phone, is the positioning of the ""browser"" button. It is far too easy to hit this when returning to the home screen and doing so causes the browser to open and you are almost immediately debited 1 minute. This may not sound like much, but it happens repeatedly and it adds up. I am not a conspiracy theorist so I'll assume it's just bad design. Until you get used to it, this could be a money drain so I'll just have to teach my child to be more careful. Note that if you are on the offered unlimited plan this won't be an issue, but given the wide array of plan options, I chose to start with a lesser plan as a trial run.It's a good, inexpensive phone and I think it will serve the needs of my child well, but as an iPhone user, I could never, ever replace my true smart phone with this. It's night and day.",4.0,1326758400,"01 17, 2012",LG 900G Prepaid Phone (Net10),19.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41b0dyAPmYL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 19353},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"
B004PEWPCI,A3BPAFDOGEQ8J5,Hao Zhang,"[4, 4]","I actually don't use this phone anymore, but I still have it. So I'll just review it based on my previous experience with it. I got this from WalMart.com for ~$30, it was a bonus pack including a 4GB microSD card, a pair of hands-free earphones, and a car charger. It worked very well for the time I've had it.Let's take a tour of the physical form of this phone. The screen is bright and clear, the images look pretty sharp and crisp. The keyboard is full QWERTY, with a few shortcut keys around it. The left side of the phone has the volume controls and the microSD card slot. The right side of the phone has only the camera button (you have to hold it for about 2 seconds to access the camera). The top of the phone has the micro USB port for charging the phone and transferring files, and a 3.5"" headphone jack. The back of the phone has the 2 megapixel camera and a little self-portrait mirror, and the hole for the speaker.Upon starting the phone, you will see the home screen. You can actually customize the home screen with a few built-in widgets (not many) by going to Settings >> Screen >> Screen Theme. For those wondering what the button under the left soft key does (the one with the two overlapping squares under the Send button), it is actually a multitasking key; it's useful when you're listening to the music and browsing the web or texting at the same time. The keyboard is quite easy to use, the keys bulge out a little bit so you can differentiate between the keys. The phone has most features you would expect from a feature phone, such as messaging, contacts, recent calls, organizer, tools (alarms, calculator, stopwatch, unit converter, world time, etc.), and even a web browser. The phone is also Bluetooth enabled, so you can use headsets and transfer files and contacts from a computer or other phones.The phone is Java apps/games capable, so you can head over to websites such as GetJar and MobileRated for some Java apps and games. Not all of them are compatible with this phone, so make sure you test them. You can also buy games from TracFone/NET10's mobile website by using the built-in browser on this phone. That reminds me, you might want to use Opera Mini (a Java-based browser) and not the built-in browser, because for some reason, the browser almost always ""run out of memory"" when browsing even basic websites. If you want to install apps/games without burning your airtime, copy the .jar files to the phone/microSD card, go to My Folder >> Other Files, and select the file; you will then be asked to install the Java program.The camera is quite decent. It takes 2 megapixel images and records QCIF (176 x 144) videos. You can adjust the brightness, white balance, color effect, timer, quality, and other attributes. You can also take photos with burst shot mode, just in case you have a shaky hand and need some help getting the right one. You can also zoom in for photo taking, but you need to set the resolution of the image to VGA (640 x 480) or lower, or else you will be presented with the ""zoom not supported"" error.You can set your own MP3 files for ringtone, message tone, and start up/shut down tones. Another point of interest is its ability to play SOME flash files (.swf), just make sure they can start playing without the need of interaction from the user, because you CANNOT click on things. One other thing, the phone will default to saving things to the tiny internal memory (less than 50MB), so if you plan on using a microSD card with it (up to 4GB supported I believe), make sure you change the default saving location by going into Settings >> Memory Info. >> Primary Storage Setting and set it to ""External Memory"".Now onto the miscellaneous stuff. The battery has a capacity of 900mAh, which could power this phone for at least 3 days if used moderately. The phone runs off of AT&T; towers. It is a GSM phone, and CANNOT be used with any other carriers because TracFone/NET10 writes their own firmware onto the phone. The data speed you get on the phone is tower-dependent, and the max is around 240 kilobits per second (Kbps), or 30 kilobytes per second (KBps) since the phone's highest cellular technology is EDGE. If you use your phone quite a lot, go with the NET10 version; if you just want to use this phone as a spare/backup phone or you just never use your cellphone, go with the TracFone version.For the time I've had this phone, I was quite satisfied. Although it's no high-tech smartphone, it gets the job done at a decent price. I was using the phone with NET10's $25 a month plan with 750 minutes for data, calls, and text. If you need a basic feature phone with a physical keyboard, this is the phone to go.

I have had several other pre-paid cellphones from Net10 and it's Sister company, Tracfone. I have found the battery life in this one to be very good. The screen size if good also, not huge, but for this type of phone, very good, in fact, a Friend of mine has a Blackberry phone, side by side, they look alike.  I like the idea of easy access to the sd memory card, It's located right on the side of the phone, you dont have to take out the battery to get to it. Currently, I have a 4gb micro sd card in it.  It's bluetooth works very well with my Car's bluetooth. As far as Texting goes, I have found this to be very easy to text with, even using one hand. I also like the way you can purchase minutes for this, either online or buying a card at a local store that carries them. They also have a $15 a month plan too, the minutes carry over, if you talk alot, this one may be for you.  I have done the minutes several different ways. Using the monthly plan is a very good idea, but I do not like having a monthly pay out commitment on a phone. I choose refilling the minutes online. I have not been dissappointed in this phone. I reccomend it! UPDATE: 7-21-12 I thought I would try to save even more by using a tracfone with triple minutes for life. As it turned out, Neither phone I used with them could hold a candle to the LG900G, I'm returning to it next week. This phone rules!

Thought I could watch videos from youtube on this phone, oops, not a chance. You can't watch anything on this device.  Read another review complaining about Customer Service. I totally agree. Signed up for the unlimited plan. After the second month, I put $50.00 on the phone thinking it would cover the unlimited plan and nope, they switched it to the $30 plan. Ticked me off. Try getting broken English speaking Customer Service people to understand the problem. Plan on spending an hour or two on the phone with them becaause that's what's going to happen. Another thing, the memory sucks even with a memory card. THE ABSOLUTE WORST PART OF OWNING THIS PHONE IS THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL. That's a joke.

However, there are many drawbacks to settling for the cheaper version. Also, like with all electronics, it became outdated fast.Pros: Price (Less $), Smartphone, Decent camera, QWERTY flip out keyboard (HUGE PLUS!!!!!!), touch screen, customizability, Moderate-fast start-up speed, Android OS allows for thousands of appsCons: VERY little internal storage space, often sporadically ""rejects"" or unmounts external micro SD card, poor battery life, pre-loaded apps take up precious internal space, slow compared to products now on the market, freezes up sometimes (have to either restart or take battery out for 30 seconds)Bottom line: This phone would be excellent for someone who wants to transition into touch screen, but still wants the QWERTY flip out keyboard.

When I received a text message, I would use the touchscreen to click on the thread, instead of taking me to the correct thread, I would be directed to a completely different text thread that I could have no where near chosen.-The service is shotty, at best.

The only way it would stop is if I used the virtual keyboard on the touch screen or restart the entire phone.-Now the most recent issued I've had with this phone, is that now the screen is going through a discoloration phase for some reason.

B004VLXHA4,A31L2TD8SQGFI9,NMazzoni,"[7, 8]","Prior to August 2010, the LG VS740 Ally was a great ahead-of-its-time smartphone in many ways.  This was both good & bad.  Because of many features unheard of in many smartphones up to its release date, it quickly became popular and so LG rushed to meet the demand...and failed miserably in the process.  The quality of the rushed LG Allys diminished internally.  Many complaints of DOAs and freezing software and FCs followed and the reputation of the phone plummeted.  This was sad.I've had my Ally since the first week of May 2010 (shortly after it was available in April of 2010) and my only complaint is the tiny size of internal memory on the phone.  It has since been updated to Android 2.2.2* (modified version of FroYo that does not allow Adobe Flash due to the ARM cpu) however, this can be worked around using the Skyfire browser found in the Android Market - and the Android version now allows Apps2SD.So if you purchase or receive a new/refurbed LG Ally that was produced after August of 2010, you may just get a dud.  For more info you can wiki the phone or visit lgallyforums (.) com******UPDATE w more info Feb 23 2012****Hands down, this phone has the very best QWERTY layout of any phone before and currently in the market with a smooth & responsive feel to the buttons after nearly 2yrs of EXTENSIVE txting.  It breaks up receiving walls of texts so that you can see the correct order & what is incoming (i.e 1/6) and long pressing a text opens a window of options where you can lock it, call the #, copy the msg, view msg details, or delete an individual msg.Verizon is to blame for the eventual sluggishness as their crapware that is not removable takes up much needed memory space.  I have had to delete almost all the fun apps I was able to download when I first got the phone simply because the shrinking space will cause the phone to freeze (many complaints on this).  Once I did, however, the phone functions perfectly still.  I have to constantly clear my txt messages as well to keep the memory full warning from annoying me.I am too chicken to root this phone since it works perfectly so long as I manage the space.As of this writing, I only have 4 apps I downloaded that I deemed useful and worthy enough to keep as I had to decide what had to come off to keep the phone from freezing up due to lack of space.  The phone comes with many free and useful apps built-in such as ThinkFree Office, Youtube, Skype Mobile, News & Weather (which is very accurate), Gmail, and a handy and useful Navigator for driving.However, it would be nice if I could also have kept Angry Birds Rio that I downloaded. I had to delete it due to memory issues, but when I had it, the paid version played flawlessly.I kept the following apps: Battle.net Mobile Auth for my WoW accnt, Skyfire & Dolphin HD browsers, and Easy Reminder - atm I only have 8 MP3s & the Skyfire browser loaded on the SD card - transferring data to and from the phone is incredibly easy with dragging and dropping like any windows folder.  I keep an 8GB SD card in it which is a very nice feature as I have saved full movies in .avi format and 3 gigs of songs at one point.  The phone plays movies seamlessly with ZERO stutters and ZERO ghosting! It really was ahead of its time.I will be eligible for an upgrade phone soon and I am dreading it.  Why? Because I want the same phone essentially but with some upgraded specs: exact same QWERTY slider but with duocore or faster cpu, the same BRIGHT CRISP SAMOLED Plus HD - at least a 4.3 scrn w Gorilla Glass, at least an 8megapixel cam, 16GB internal with 32GB SD Card (like the HTC Rezound) drool (I know I am such a geek lol), Gingerbread or ICS Android, and the same excellent call quality and outstanding loud speakerphone.LG TAKE NOTE!

I wouldn't throw this device under the bus if the problem was simply that I'd received a lemon because that happens. If you do a search, however, you'll find this to be a common complaint for this device & one I've experienced a few times personally. What's more, the screen's resolution and vividness isn't up to par for an HD device.An expensive, dual core, HD phone should have either a higher resolution or an AMOLED screen. This phone is out-classed by it's other dual core, HD competitors.This high-end device is stuck on Android 2.2 (Froyo) in spite of never ending claims that it will get 2.3 (Gingerbread).I purchased this phone 2 weeks ago and I'm already on my 3rd device because of the screen bleeding light and device rebooting. If it weren't for these two issues, this would be a wonderful smartphone. ...but then, if I had wings I could fly.To T-Mobile's credit, instead of giving customer's a hard time, the company acknowledge the issue and willingly & swiftly replaces the faulty units whilst taking up the quality issues with LG. T-Mobile is handling this issue in a timely, fair & professional manner.If you seek a dual core HD device from T-Mobile, I suggest you go for HTC's Sensation 4G. Do a side-by-side comparison on gsmarena. It has a bigger screen with more pixels (qHd). It shoots 1080p at 30fps, instead of G2X's 24fps. It comes with Android 2.3.

I did experience a few of the known issues (random reboots & frozen screen), so I took it in to exchange for another one. On the second phone I got on 10/21, I have not experienced any problems what so ever! The phone is absolutely amazing! It sounds to me that with this phone, its kind of the luck of the draw? Or quite possibly, operator error? I am a bit of a tech geek and I love to push my devices to the limits. In the 3 weeks that I have been using this phone, I have rooted it and tried several different custom ROMS & Kernels. Like the previous review said, rooting phones is not for everyone. However, I am willing to bet that my G2x is faster than 98% of smart phones on the market today. I have put this phone through EXTREMELY HEAVY use and overloaded it many times and it continues to live up to every challenge I throw at it. My fiance also got the G2x on our upgrade. She has not experienced any of the problems and did not have to exchange it for a new one. Her first phone is running stock and operates beautifully. I also have a friend with this phone, he was experiencing all of the same issues. He rooted the phone and put a custom ROM on it, and ALL of the issues disappeared. So my suggestion to any consumer looking into buying this phone is this. I highly recommend the phone to anyone. You will enjoy it MUCH MUCH more if you are tech savvy and will be rooting the device.

It wasn't exactly stellar, but it was good enough. I experienced a very rare random reboot and very occasional lock-up.  Super rare, and not necessarily an indicator of the software.  Still, reports of that behavior abound on the internet with the 2.3.3 Gingerbread update.And then in April, LG/T-Mobile released a 2.3.4 update.  And wowza.  Totally solid phone.  In the 2 months since the update, I have never experienced a crash.  I don't believe I had any random reboots, though I guess it might have done it in the middle of the night.  Never once during the day when I was using it or needed it.  I'm finally really impressed.  So let's quit talking about software and get to hardware.The screen is the first thing you'll notice, and it's gorgeous.  4"", 800x480 resolution, IPS display.  IPS is one of the higher-quality LCD technologies out there, with very wide viewing angles, accurate color reproduction, and bright backlights.  It has all of that.  The screen, in fact, is what sold me on this phone in the first place. The body is sturdy and solid-feeling, as well.  The screen is covered in glass, there's a metalic trim on the sides, and a soft-touch rubberized plastic battery door.  The volume/power buttons are solid and tactile, and pressing them is easy without being out of control.  It has 2 cameras, one front-facing (which is good enough for skype) and a really nice 8MP camera on the back with LED flash.  Pictures are great, you know, for a phone.  It replaced my Nikon point-and-shoot 8MP camera since the photos are basically the same to my eyes, but if you want dSLR quality, get a dSLR.  Duh, it's a phone.After that is the engine running this ship, an nVidia Tegra 2 SoC and 512MB of RAM.  The Tegra 2 is as fast as any other 1GHz dual-core CPU, and the ultra-low-voltage GeForce GPU is quite sufficient for all your gaming wants and needs.  Where it falls a little short is the 512MB of RAM.  Occasionally if an app runs wild, the phone will sputter.  Zynga's games are the worst offenders I've found; Words and Scramble both use around 40MB when they're idle.  Totally unacceptable, honestly, and because they dont' get along with the phone I removed them.  If the phone had 768MB of RAM (like the MyTouch 4G and MyTouch 4G Slide) it'd be a different story, or if it had 1GB like the Motorola Atrix (the other Tegra 2 phone that came out in early 2011) it'd be a total non-issue.  512MB of RAM is plenty most of the time, though.The phone has 8GB of storage total, with 1.45GB partitioned off for app storage (which is plenty), 3.7GB set aside as the ""SD Card"" (internal storage), and the rest eaten up by Android's system, cache, and boot partitions.  So 5.25GB of space available to the user, and a micro SD slot that supports micro SDHC cards, so you can have another 32GB of space if you so choose.  My phone came with an 8GB SD card for a total of 16GB of storage, but if you buy used I would not count on getting that bonus.Call clarity is great.  The speaker gets relatively loud before it distorts.  I can hear people well, they can hear me well, and that's either using the handset or the speaker phone.  It has Bluetooth but i have not used it.  It also has micro-HDMI output for playing videos or games on your TV, and the phone came with a cable, but I have not made use of it yet.The phone has been discontinued but it's well worth getting. Finally.  The only way you're going to get nicer off-contract is to spend twice as much money on a MyTouch 4G Slide, or even more on a Galaxy S II or HTC One series phone.  I can't say enough.  I'm using it with the $30/month Monthly 4G pre-paid plan (I don't need more than 100 cell phone minutes, but I want the data coverage and Android OS).  Cell network speeds in my area are fast enough - this gets the same bandwidth in the same places as my wife's LG Optimus T, which varies anywhere from 6.8mbit to next-to-nothing out in the middle of nowhere.  Dropped calls are a non-issue with the phone. Reception si as good as my old phone (a cheapy java phone) or my wife's phone.I think that covers it.  It gets an unqualified thumbs-up from me as of mid-April 2012.

However, when using it as a head set, it was only fair.  Callers sounded as if they were in a cave (I could hear a slight echo).

Voice activated controls work flawlessly (almost) with the Motorola Photon I have paired to these.The neck thing was kind of in question when I ordered it, however it is extremely light, and can be worn all day.It can be worn under a loose collar, or outside the collar. I didnt have any trouble with the wires tugging or hanging up because they are adjustable.The good thing is the battery will handle it. I used mine for two days, on and off without charging.No more sore ears, earpieces dropped in pools, toilets etc., and just large enough to keep track of.

Although I have a pretty good case for the phone, it was a matter of time before something bad was going to happen. Also, it was my third wired headset from line breakage near the plug. So I did a lot of research and decided to try the LG HBS 700. I mainly listen to podcasts and some music but still wanted to retain the ability to use the phone. This unit met all those needs. The bluetooth pairing is fast and simple. The earbuds are comfortable, the controls are easy to feel and use (one you know what all the buttons do). and I hardly notice any weight around my neck.

B0052YFYFK,A8M5WJ8H1K4T7,Alex Alexzander,"[2, 2]","I bought a pair of these headphones for use in my walking and jogging exercise routines. I use them with an iPhone 4s. Mine seem to skip out the audio a fair amount. I suspect this may have something to do with GPS. That's what comes to mind anyway. I don't really know why they drop audio. I could try them with GPS off and see what happens just to see.Aside from the above, I'm someone who buys the Apple headphones with the play/pause forward/backward mic on the cable so I can skips songs, talk to Siri or make/receive a call. However, when you constantly jog or do intense cycling with the Apple ear-buds it seems to me that a little sweat on those headphones kills the controls. They just flat out stop working. I can say that I order them from Amazon a lot. I tend to buy 4 replacement headphones at a time, which gets expensive. I carry an extra pair in my laptop bag. I have a few extra pairs at the office and home. Just yesterday another pair died on me.So anyway...  my thinking is to go wireless. If I sweat on these there is nowhere for it to go really. When you see the image of these you'll understand. Today I did 2 miles run and then a 1,500 foot incline over 3 miles. Get my heart rate as high as 163. Having the right music keeps me going. Any the last thing I want is something that feels awkward and takes me out of my oneness with the road, the wind and my workout. These headphones are almost invisible to my attention. The collar goes pretty much unnoticed. And the cables going from the collar to the ear buds are long enough that you can twist your head in any direction without ever feeling a wire touch your neck.Back to Apple's ear buds for a second. One of the biggest problems with ear buds, is that as you jog your arms sway in and out building momentum for your body. Wired ear bud cables can sometimes get yanked right out of your ear when the cable gets in the path of a swaying fist. And this of course isn't a pleasant feeling. It happens at home too. Once in a while I pass an open door and find my ear yanked hard because the cord of a head phone gets caught on the passing doorknob.Don't like the seemingly random cutting out, but I'll take that over corded headphones. Maybe someone should make WiFI sport headphones for joggers. It was actually pretty difficult to find a pair of headphones that looked like they'd be suitable for jogging.  So far these seem the most suitable.Update 8-11-2012I have changed from the iPhone 4s to the Samsung Galaxy SIII. And guess what... The headphones don't cut out anymore. Well, as long as I leave the phone in an arm holster, the signal is strong. I find that if I put the phone in my back pocket, then the headphones cut out. And standing close to a microwave oven also causes drop outs.I'm now using these headphones for running, the trip to and from work and walking.

B0052YFYFK,A1SZBJP7ID93YG,Amanda,"[2, 2]","I was given these headphones as a gift and while I thought they were kinda neat I wasn't really sure how much I would use them. I typically use my headphones for physical activities like running and cycling; and I already have a pair that stay in my ears while doing that (previously my only criteria). But since the giver was very excited about them I thought I'd give them a try. I've had them a week and I've found it hard to put them down since. It's amazing how liberating it is not to have a wire. I keep having to remind myself that I can just walk away from my phone, or I don't have to unplug my headphones when I get off the bike.Pros so far:-Battery power. My initial charge seemed to last forever! Then it only took about an hour to recharge.-Distance. I find it has pretty decent distance. In my office I can go just about anywhere with zero interference (about 1800 sq ft but it is mostly ""open"" space with few walls). At my house I left my phone in my car parked in my driveway, went inside my house about 20 feet and it still worked fine. This will really depend on what's in between you and your phone but for the most part you're pretty free.-Everything it can do! Part of this is because I have an iphone 5S but I'm very impressed with all that I can do without touching my phone, including having it read my texts or emails. Requires no setup or special app, just push the phone button and say ""read my texts"", after reading it Siri will ask you if you want to reply and she'll accept dictation. Speech seems to be very clear through the headset. Previously I didn't have much use for Siri, now I'm using it all the time. If you're like me and don't utilize it much, I'd suggest Googling everything Siri can do.-Noise canceling. These headphones work well to cancel out background noise. Almost a little too well, so I only wear one ear bud while at work.-Comfort. I thought it'd be awkward to have these around my neck all day but I forget that it is there.My one complaint, is that for me these won't stay in my ears during a high impact workout, like running. They seem fine for everything else including the gym, elliptical and cycling. Maybe I just have funny ears :) But I'll probably stick to my headphones that wrap around my ears for my runs.

The problem with ears is that everyone's ears are different, and despite being similar, the generic earpieces all suck for my ears.  Beyond that, the biggest drawback for Bluetooth headsets that I found was battery life.  If I'm working for eight hours and my earpiece dies after three, I'm out of luck.  For the longest time I relegated myself to using corded earbuds with my phone, because it was the only thing that was comfortable that I could wear for a long period of time.  For ages, I wished that I could find something as comfortable as my earbuds without the hassle and frustration of a cord and a plug tying me to my phone.Enter LG, and their remarkable invention, the LG Tone.  I ordered this item in August of 2012, and I've been using it each and every day since it arrived.  The earbuds are soft and comfortable, and it arrived with a variety of sizes for varying ear canals.  I use my headset at work to listen to streaming audio, and although the advertised battery life is ten hours of use, I frequently get much more.  The controls are easy to use, and despite its size, once the collar is resting around your neck it's barely noticeable, and light as a feather.  I even wear it when running and working out at the gym without any problems.  Bluetooth range is exceptional, allowing me to walk thirty feet or more from my phone before I experience any interruption in signal.Without question, I will never buy another traditional Bluetooth headset again.

It lies comfortably around your neck and the short, but adjustable, earbud cords reach  perfectly to your ears.The soft silicone earbuds fit very comfortably and are supplied in 2 sizes: small and medium.

So you can imagine that wired headphones can get annoying really quickly.  While there are lots of bluetooth headphones out there, I wear glasses, which means that ear-bud headphones are most comfortable for me.  The ear-bud types are really rare, and the ones I have found (aside from these) tend to be of very poor quality according to reviews, or they are more expensive than I would like.These LG headphones are relatively cheap, and they are high quality.  I have been using them for about a week now, and I think I can easily say that they are the best headphones I have ever owned.

This is because the grouping of buttons on each side are very logical. Changing volume and forward/rewind songs make sense.One thing we often taking for granted is the ease of switching connection with varies devices.

I found out from the LG live chat rep there's no way to see how much battery is left...see the conversation below:Guest: Hi I just received my LG Tone HBS-700Guest: and have a few questionsGuest: Am I able to check the battery status some how?Guest: and how long does it take to fully charge?Guest: and can it be used while chargingJermel: 1. no to the first question.Jermel: It should take as long as it will show the fully charged light.Guest: so once the light is blue?Jermel: And it is not recommend to be used while charging.Guest: okGuest: Is there a warning sign when the battery is low?Jermel: You will start to notice that the quality of the calls are not the same.Guest: thats it?Guest: no flashing lights?Guest: or anything of that kindJermel: Unfortunately not.I am sure I need to live down the hype of not having to deal with cords now and having stereo sound first before I can make an honest review. But so far, calls worked great (people on the other end said I sounded clear), battery is rated for at least a whole day worth of use and the music sounds great (I am not super picky about the sound BUT am picky when it comes to static sounds and the like, which I did not hear)Only time will tell how well this will hold up. I will update this review with any bad (or good) observations in the future that are worth mentioning. For now, 4 stars for the initial impression.---- UPDATE ---- ONE YEAR LATER ----So I have had these headphones for a year now and still work like day one. I am leaving at 4 stars because while it serves its purpose well, I wish it had some type of battery meter. It pairs well with my iPhone 5 (upgraded since the last time) and the buttons on the BT headset still function properly. Battery life seems to be good. I wear the headset in the office, while working out and cleaning. None of the components have started to wear off and no clips or ear buds have broken off. I use for music and taking calls over bluetooth and it is good. By good I mean it serves its purpose. If you're looking for rich bass and treble with amazing voice call quality - you may want to look elsewhere (like in the $100 range).

I decided on this LG item first since it seems more inconspicuous and won't leave a dent in the hair, LOL! The Runaway headset does seem sturdier though..Upon first seeing this LG item, I was surprised how skinny and flexible the loop part of this headset was (the section that goes around the back of the neck)! Indeed very lightweight and I hope this doesn't make it too fragile. Want this headset to last awhile ..To start, swing the usb slot cover out to charge the unit via a micro usb to wall outlet plug. It paired easily with a Samsung Galaxy 7&#34; Tab 2 and also to an older model flip cellphone. The headset vibrates and flashes when there's an incoming call. Pressing the button on one end turns off the music and connects the headset to the incoming call. Talk quality is excellent from both sides of the phone conversation.The magnetic earbuds are seated into the grooved ends of the headset and the wire slide adjustments take up the slack to keep the cords from getting all tangled up. I would recommend storing the headset in a protective pouch or ziploc bag to prevent the wires and all the various buttons from getting scraped up and damaged.This is an impressive product .. recommended!",5.0,1387584000,"12 21, 2013",LG Tone Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange,105.97,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JnHbj9SmL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 830},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

The design is much more comfortable that I expected. As many reviews state, you really do forget you are wearing them.Not having to worry about the cord snagging and wrapping around every little thing takes a little getting used to.The sound is much better than an old wrap around BT that did pretty much the same things as the LG, just poorly.I didn't think that there was such a device that would provide great battery life, good range, great sound, and practical design in one package.The LG Tone has done so admirably.The meh: Running, and outdoors generally, are slightly better. Earphones do allow me to hear outside noise. The buds tend to slip around with jarring and moisture. Other than super glue, there really isn't a good solution though. Wind can be a problem, but what system doesn't have that problem.The cord can get hung up on the collar, or a shoulder strap catch it, but this has only happened two or three times. This is easy to avoid.Summary: The phone is great. The mike picks up just what it needs to.

Next is comfort and they again succeed where others have failed, the main unit is very lightweight and when I'm in my work attire with a collared shirt I wear it underneath the collar and on top of my undershirt and would not even notice that it is there. In a T-Shirt it's a bit different but still not uncomfortable.

The vibrating notification for calls is a novel concept that I love though it kind of freaked me out at first since I was not aware that it did that.My big complaints are with the design of the cable and the earbud holders, the magnet are far too weak and they often get knocked out. Sometimes I just let them hang down the inside of my shirt instead of bothering with them.

I like that while I'm wearing the headset and someone comes up to me all I need do is flip one of the ear-buds out and I can hear what they're saying.  If it's someone I *really* care about I flip both out.  If it's someone I don't want to talk to I flip... never mind.  When I want to resume resuming the ear buds are easy to retrieve.  If I want to get fancy I can drop them in the magnetic holders at either end of the around-my-neck thingy.The headset works flawlessly with my iPhone4.  The ""call"" button answers calls if someone is calling, hangs up when I'm done, and get's Siri's attention at other times.  Thanks to a decent microphone Siri understands what I say as do people I call.  Also, unlike the S9, it doesn't matter where I carry my phone.  The signal is clear at all times.About the only time I used my S9 was while I walked my dog.  I'm using these lots more.  While they don't sound as good as some of my wired headsets (costing many times more) they do sound pretty darn good and there is the convenience of not having to deal with a cord.In some ways this headset travels better than wired headsets because there's nothing to get tangled.  Just drop the earbuds in their individual magnetic holders and put the whole thing in a flat compartment of your backpack, briefcase, purse, satchel, valise, etc, and you're good to go.  For me it fits nicely in pocket #3 of myMoblie Edge, Mini Messenger Bag fits up to 13.3- Inch laptops and 11- Inch widescreen netbooks, Black/Dr Pepper.So how, you ask, can you make it better still?  This headset came with two different sized pairs of ear gels, one pair slightly larger than medium and the other pair slightly smaller than medium.  My problem is, these press-to-fit ear gels never work for me.  Some work better than others and these worked about as good as any but it wasn't perfect; they would slip out on occasion.  Then I stumbled across these:2 Pair, Mens Size - Earphones Plus Brand, Tri-Level, Replacement Ear Cushions, Earbuds for Sound Isolating Earphones. (See Fit Information in Details Below).  They fit both this headset and my ears perfectly.  The soft silicon (?) seals out noise, keeps the ear buds from slipping out without having to drive them in with a hammer, and they make the headset sound even better.  *Now* it's totally perfect!Please feel free to let Amazon and me know if this review was helpful to you since it helps me improve the information I provide.",5.0,1334361600,"04 14, 2012",LG Tone Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange,105.97,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JnHbj9SmL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 830},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"
B0052YFYFK,A11P105WVK5240,"Bocaboy ""BocaBoy""","[1, 1]","I've owned a few variations of Bluetooth headsets that I've used while exercising, including the Motorola S-9 and S-10 and the Jaybird Freedoms. The new LG Tone 700 may look a bit strange, but it quickly became my favorite Bluetooth headset for exercise and general use.The 700 fits around your neck, and is light enough that you really don't know you're wearing them. The only caveat I'd add regarding comfort is that if you're wearing a collarless shirt, like a tee shirt when running, you will feel the headset's thin band on the back of your neck. This doesn't bother me since the Jaybirds have a wire connecting the two earbuds that also rides the back of our neck, and the Motorola headsets have a heavy, think band that goes back and over your ears. When evaluating comfort, also keep in mind that a regular wired headset or earbuds have a wire that's flapping around. On balance, the LG headset is really the most comfortable and least noticeable of those I've tried.Surprisingly, the LG's stay in place, even when running. Unlike the Jaybirds, which have some weight to them that helps to dislodge them from your ear, the LG earbuds are featherweight and stay put. After the first few minutes of wearing them, I didn't even notice that I had them on, they're really that comfortable. With a collared shirt, like a polo, I didn't feel the headband at all. It's like they're not there!The LG's have the best battery life by far of any of the Bluetooth headsets I've owned. I tried an experiment with the LG's where I used them on two 1-hour runs, then took them to the golf course where I volunteer once a week and listened to them for 6 hours straight. The battery didn't quit and still had enough juice to keep running. The Jaybirds and the Motorolas would both have died after about 3 to 4 hours of use.The built-in phone works great, and no one I talked to with the LG's complained about the sound, even though I was outdoors. I often got complaints with the Jaybirds that people had trouble hearing me.I will concede that the Jaybirds have better sound and noticeably better fidelity than the LG's. The LG can be adjusted to boost the bass response, but they don't match the Jaybirds for sound. On the other hand, the Jaybirds can't compete with the battery life of the LG, so you'll have to decide what's most important to you. I mostly listen to audiobooks while I exercise so a small loss of fidelity, while disappointing, isn't a deal breaker for me.There is a newer version of this headset, the 730, but after reading the reviews, I thought I'd stick with the 700. There are reports that the 730 is less stable holding onto a Bluetooth signal, although I can't verify those reports. I can say that the 700 is rock solid and doesn't drop the audio stream even when the phone is in my pocket of backpack.The bottom line is that I think the LG's are a great value for the price. The Motorola S-9's LED burned out on me after a year, and the S10 wasn't nearly as comfortable as its sibling. The Jaybird Freedom slips out of my ear, even with all of their adapters, so I'm constantly fiddling with them as I run. In addition, the Jaybird Freedoms have limited controls for your iPhone or iPod. Stop, start and volume are about all you can do, as well as answer a call. With the LG you can fast forward or reverse as well as jump tracks. Another plus in this area for the LG is that it can tell you it's remaining battery life via its LED, which the Jaybirds can't.Compared to these products, the LG Bluetooth Stereo Headset is my new benchmark for audio. They do look a bit weird, but they really are well designed to deliver maximum battery life, a strong Bluetooth connection, and all the controls you need to manipulate your iPhone or Android device.",5.0,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",LG Tone Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange,105.97,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JnHbj9SmL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 830},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

I keep my smartphone (which the headset is connected to via Bluetooth) in a pouch beneath my bike seat. I only use the left earbud (illegal to wear 2 earbuds while riding a bike in California, and its safer to only wear one).Bluetooth connectivity:Works very well. It automatically connects to my smartphone when I turn the headset on. The connection rarely cuts out and, if it does, cuts out for less than a second.Audio:The sound quality seems pretty good.Locking the earbuds into the earbud holder:The earbuds have magnets in them (don't worry, they shouldn't fry your brain...) so they 'lock in' to the earbud holders pretty easily, and then they stay there (even when I'm bouncing around on my bike). The magnets are nice because they enable me to lock the earbuds into the earbud holders without looking, and also when I have semi-bulky gloves on. Occasionally, the earbuds do fall out of the earbud holders; this usually happens when I am riding 'hard' and am bumping up and down a lot while riding.Comfort:I often forget that I'm wearing this headset. That is how comfortable and light and unobtrusive this headset is! The earbuds, themselves, are very comfortable, as well. The neckband is especially useful for me because I only wear one earbud. If there was no neckband that holds earbuds not in use, the earbud that I do not use would hang and pull the other earbud down.Button Controls:The volume and song skip buttons are very accessible. I can even press them when I have semi-bulky gloves on, though I can often press the wrong button (volume up instead of volume down).Battery Life:The headset lasts something like 500 - 800 minutes on a full charge.

B0052YFYFK,AKS63YLLYU1K5,D. C. Eaton,"[1, 1]","I received the LG Tone as a gift.  First my evaluation; then the comparison.Setup: EasyI charged the LG and turned it on.  I turned on bluetooth on my Samsung Note, and then hit the button to search for bluetooth devices.  The Note immediately found the LG and I told it to pair - which took less than 5 seconds.Comfort: Good.The LG sits around my neck almost unnoticed. It comes with only 2 silicone ear bud sizes, but the larger one fit my ears.  The ear buds are then just as comfortable as any other ear bud.Snagging wires: No wires!Other ear buds must be connected by their wires to the phone/device and are prone to snagging.Range: About 30 feet.Casual Listening: Great!No hum, no hiss, no obvious distortion, and overall volume is good.  I usually have my Samsung Note music player set to 9/15 loudness with the LG volume set 3 down from the max loudness. The  LG Tone is a pleasure to use.COMPARISONContestants:1. LG Tone HBS-700 Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset (set to bass boost)2. Samsung Note Ear Buds3. JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds4. GOgroove DynaMIX High-Performance Ear Buds5. Sennheiser HD203 Closed-Back DJ Headphones (full size)6. JVC HA-RX500 Over-the-Ear Headphones (full size)Last Place: Gogroove.  Maybe this is unfair.  GOgroove didn't sound bad and seemingly (see below) had good base, but it was way too bright for my taste.  [If your ears have lost sensitivity to high frequencies maybe this would be your first choice.]Second Place: LG Tone, Samsung, and Jbuds.Really, it was hard to tell the difference between any of these 3 second place ear buds.  They were all a bit bright and all seemingly (see below) had good thumping base.  All 3 have what I would call a good quality of sound (low distortion).  I am happy that the LG sounded as good (to my ears) as any of the other ear buds.First Place: Sennheiser and JVC full size headphones.I hope nobody is surprised here!  There is just no way an ear bud can beat a good quality over-ear full-size headphone.  The ear buds only began to seem a bit bright when compared to the full size headphones.  Clarity was also better in the full size headphones (but not much better).  BASS RESPONSE?  This was the big difference.  After all, the JVC has a 40mm driver (almost 2 inches in size)!  Although the ear buds seemed to have good bass response, as soon as I put on the full size headphones the sad truth became obvious.  ALL of the ear buds were weak on bass and none of them had any very deep bass what-so-ever.  But then you knew that already, didn't you?Conclusion:  I think that all the second place ear buds (including the LG Tone) are at least adequate for casual listening, and because of their smaller size they are more convenient to carry around.  The  LG Tone was my favorite since it didn't have wires to snag.",5.0,1334880000,"04 20, 2012",LG Tone Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange,105.97,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JnHbj9SmL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 830},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

B0052YFYFK,APZ4V7V642TCI,Don,"[0, 0]","So this was my third pair of Bluetooth headsets and it's the third one that fails my usability tests. Bear in mind all 3 were different brands and all 3 had significant faults to them that forced me to return them.For starters I was kind of put off by it being called &#34;wireless&#34; when infact you have wires leading to the actual ear pieces but that's just semantics I guess. They seemed durable, flexible and looked like they could be around for the long haul. I had no problem syncing them with my Android phone and the sound clearly beats out the Plantronics rival and the Motorola. While the bass is weak the overall sound quality is the best one could expect from a Bluetooth device. Same goes for the call quality.Now looking at the device before I purchased it one would assume that since it sits around your neck it would be stiff like a partial necklace in case you had to have them on while you were doing anything that required you to be horizontal. Not the case, it is flimsy and really the only thing keeping this on your neck is the weight (not much of it) of the ends/buttons. This poses a significant problem if your sole reason for purchasing these is to utilize them at the gym. If you need to do a bench workout, situps or anything that requires you to lay flat even for a moment these will fall right off your neck. When running with these they bounce around your neck and don't feel at all secure. I tucked mine into my shirt but I'd imagine if your a woman and run in a sports bra or tank top that's just not going to be possible.Much like the Motorola I wanted to like these but at the end of the day the cons really outweighed the pros and I could not in good conscience let LG keep my money for this product. I'm hoping one day someone get's this mastered for a reasonable price but until then if you're an active guy/gal and looking specifically for a gym headset I'd stick with a good pair of wired ear buds.",2.0,1367107200,"04 28, 2013",LG Tone Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange,105.97,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JnHbj9SmL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 830},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

On the backbeats, the bulk of the units rests behind your ears, and on these, only the buds come up to your ears. In theory they Tone would be more comfortable. They are but the Tone is lopsided wieghtwise so one side tends to slip down, which shortens the wire on that side and makes the bud pull out of you ear if you turn your head.They look better than the backbeats, but the backbeats have better bass. also the buds are very easy to knock out of thier rests.On the plus side, you can have the buds out of your ears, and the unit will vibrate when a call comes in so you can quickly pop a bud in and answer",3.0,1370304000,"06 4, 2013",LG Tone Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange,105.97,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JnHbj9SmL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 830},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

Bluetooth headphones are a challenge for hardware designers because of the need to house the electronics and a big enough battery to supply decent autonomy, and the need for a wire between the electronics and both earpieces.This is why so far there has only been two major designs on the market: one is large over-the-ear pads connected with a headband or just a wire, the other being earbuds connected by a wire to a little box housing the electronics. Both designs have problems: the former is usually uncomfortable and the earpads tend to have problems staying in place, particularly when exercising; the latter defeats the purpose of wireless headphones by still leaving you to deal with a tangled mess of wires.The HBS-700 offers a novel approach to solving this problem: the electronics and controls are housed in a circle clip that sits around your neck, and the earbuds are connected to it by a short wire that can't get tangled. Even better, the earbuds attach magnetically to the tips of the neckband when not in use.Ergonomically, the HBS-700 gets top marks. The usual controls are very logically organized and easy to identify by touch even while running or exercising. The power switch is a mechanical slider, so there's never any doubt whether your headphone is on or off. Charging is done via a standard microUSB connector.The features are what you expect from bluetooth stereo headphones: bluetooth action button (pick up an incoming call, hang up, initiate a call/siri, redial), volume +/- on the left hand side, play/pause, previous and next on the right hand side. Everything works very reliably and just as you would expect (I have been using these headphones for months with an iPhone 4)Even better, the battery life is phenomenal (at least 10 hours of music playback) and the neckband vibrates when a call comes in: impossible to miss a call even in a noisy environment or while exercising.If you're listening to music and a call comes in, press the call button to pick up the call and the music pauses. When you hang up, the music resumes.In terms of sound quality, the HBS-700 delivers as well. These are not high quality audiophile headphones, but they sound perfectly adequate and will be great to use at the gym, while jogging, etc...Convenience, sound quality, battery life, reasonable price make the HBS-700 an excellent value. If you're only going to buy one set of bluetooth headphones, I can't think of a better model to recommend -- and I've tried them all.",5.0,1320192000,"11 2, 2011",LG Tone Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange,105.97,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JnHbj9SmL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 830},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

You must reconnect to your phone when you get back within the 30 foot range. Also, girls if you have long hair or a necklace on, make sure you remove your necklace and put your hair up.

B0052YFYFK,A14UIRY5JSU0AX,Frank Todd,"[18, 20]","I work in a warehouse pulling orders and driving a forklift all day, and I like to listen to news and audio books while working.  I've had a couple of Jawbone models and many pairs of corded headphones/ear-buds by Apple, Phillips, and Sony.  Problems with all of these include difficulties keeping the cord out of my way while working, volume levels too weak for loud noise environments, problems with the buds staying in my ears, and poor battery life.  This model corrects all of these deficiencies.The ear buds stay in my ears well because they are very light and the rubber tips seal well.  This was my biggest problem with the Jawbone models-even the icon was heavy enough to jostle out of my ears simply by walking.  All of the battery weight in this model is around your neck (and it's not that they're heavy, because they're not - it's just that even a little heft won't stay in my ear)  This setup also allows LG to cram at least 3 times as much battery into the halo around your neck, because the battery life is three times as long as the Jawbone, and as far as I could tell in my research, it has a better battery life than any other Bluetooth headset.Even running, the halo never threatens to fall off my neck, and I often forget it's there.  (Update; this is not the case when the buds are in the magnet pockets.  What happens then is that the buds bounce out of the pockets.  Bottom line, don't run without the buds in your ears.)The volume levels are fantastic, and with my Iphone 4 it gets louder than I can handle (and I am a drummer, I can handle loud). I can barely say this about many of the corded headsets that I have used.The range of this headset with my Iphone is the best I have ever experienced.  Maintaining line of sight, I can easily exceed 100 meters without losing signal.  In my warehouse, with many obstructions, I can exceed 50 meters as long as I don't enter a closed room without my phone.I cannot testify as to its water resistance.Callers tell me that background noise levels are much quieter than with my other headsets, which was an issue I didn't find addressed often in other reviews.There are many buttons on the headset, and initially I kept confusing the phone side with the media side (left is phone, right is media).  However, they are easy to use, have a nice feel when I press them, and I get the impression by the way that they feel when I press them that they will prove to be durable, which is a good thing because in my experience it's often buttons that wear out first on devices of this kind.The wires that connect the halo to the buds are not heavy duty, and are thin enough to have caused me a little anxiety at first, but it has not been a problem, and I cannot give too much praise to the designer who came up with the idea to provide magnetic pockets to hold the buds.  This is ingenious, and not only keeps them from flopping around when they're not in my ears, but also minimizes the opportunities for damaging them.Overall, this headset has a excellent design and is well built.  I love it, and when I wear this one out I will buy another.",5.0,1325203200,"12 30, 2011",LG Tone Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange,105.97,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JnHbj9SmL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 830},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

Connecting the unit via bluetooth has been easy.The sound is fine for podcasts & audiobooks.

Every aspect of it was paid excellent attention to. The headphone sits very well across the neck and very seamlessly. I did not sense it while running after the first few minutes.Every operation (at least the ones we care for from a headphone) has a dedicated button. This means, you can concentrate on what you do instead of figuring out a button push sequence or using it in combination.The headsets are not think and heavy going into the ear and when you are done they snap back in place that fundamentally removes cluttered wires.Performance:The pairing was seamless. It only took a few seconds (MotoACTV).I am not a audio expert by any means, so take it from that perspective. The audio stream has been very stable without any ""silence"". The bass (especially when you run outside) is okay and the it also sound slightly tinny (which can probably be adjusted if we had an EQ app but the ACTV does not support such apps). It does not isolate external audio as well as it advertises. It is definitely not annoying (not even close) but i am not sure that the noise-suppression works as well as it is advertised.The battery was high when I received it and have run for about 2 hours now and haven't had a chance to recharge it yet.I haven't tried multi-connection with my phone yet.

B0052YFYFK,A38OAEZYASPV0Q,Jacko Maccaco,"[0, 0]","This was one of my favorite purchases of the year.  I recently misplaced them, however, and will be upgrading to the new model (HBS-730).First, if you have never had wireless headphones, get ready for a treat.  Not having to worry about snagging a cord on something is great.  The battery lasts all day for me, and the duration did not seem to noticeably decrease after a year.I used them to listen to music and podcasts at work almost every day.  I appreciated the fact you can leave one earbud in, while the other sits safely in its magnetic holder.  This way I could still hear my coworkers.  Being able to leave my phone charging and still walk around while listening is great.  I can grab a glass of water from the water cooler or walk over to a colleague's desk without any hassle.  I am using a wired set of earbuds until my HBS 730 arrives, and it is amazing how much of an inconvenience the cord is.I enjoyed using them while running, although I know many hear have said the neckband bounced around too much for their liking.  This didn't bother me much so maybe my neck is bigger.  The fact that you don' t have a wire pulling on them as you run means they stayed in my ears better than a corded set.  Putting my phone in an armband and having no cord involved made running very enjoyable.Sound quality is OK.  It was better than I expected for a wireless set, and although I hear the newer version has improved sound quality, I had no complaints.  A lot of my listening was just talk radio podcasts with only one earbud in, but sound was decent for hip hop and rock when I was listening to music.Finally, just a comment on the build quality and durability.  As others have noted, these things seems to be very well built.  My set still looked new after a years worth of use.  I didn't exactly baby my set either.  They may seem kind of flimsy when you first pick them up, but the materials being used are apparently high quality.If I end up having range issues with the HBS-730 as some of the other reviewers have mentioned, I will likely end up returning those and coming back to the HBS-700.  The only thing that is NOT in question is that I apparently can't live without these, as replacing my lost pair was never in doubt.",5.0,1356566400,"12 27, 2012",LG Tone Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange,105.97,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JnHbj9SmL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 830},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

I had hoped it would also have multiple sizes of earbud covers, but no... And these earbuds are a bit too large for my ears.But I'm not returning this because I love the headset.  I use it with my iPhone 4 to listen to audio books.  Like it does with wired ear buds, it switches flawlessly between phone calls and my audio books.  Love the vibrations.  The only gotchas that I've encountered are:- I can't just hold down the phone button and go into voice control.  If I press the phone button, it only redials my previous call.  Hmmmm.  This will be s major problem when I can't look at the phone.  I did find the user manual online and downloaded it to my iPad, so will look to see if this is simply done differently on this headset.- earbud size a bit too large..  But they do seem to be secure, so I'll wear them for a few days to see how the comfort is after 4-6 hours.** correction after reading the user manual... voice control DOES work.  But where my old wired earbuds required me to press and hold the phone button to go into voice conntrol, this LG headset goes into 'redial' mode after 'press and hold'. Instead, just tap the phone button and voila, voice control.  It works great.So I've put this up to a 5star rating.  Am looking forward to finding out how long the headset lasts (wires DO break after heavy usage).  But no matter how long, I'm buying another one for my husband. This is exactly what I've been looking for!!** update 2:  tested this while wring the neck piece under the collar of my polo shirt.

This is the way to go!If you do a little research you will find that every single over the ear bluetooth set falls victim to sweat and moisture making its way into the circuitry and shorting it out... regardless of the 'Sweatproof' adverts. The only solution thus far seems to be moving the hardware to your neckline away from those hotspots. I have officially hit 4 months of constant use running and hitting the gym 3-5 times a week without a hitch. The convenience is unparalleled as you can run with your phone on your arm or workout with the phone on the ground next to you. I have taken calls in the middle of a set by simply hitting the call button. Change tracks on Pandora or even hold and speak to do voice commands. The possibilities are endless.Cons- The from factor makes for a bumpy ride if you are not wearing a shirt during a run. Normal use typically makes one end hang lower than the other which makes it feel awkward at first.

B0052YFYFK,A21CGQJX3PEUMS,"JDH ""JDH""","[1, 1]","I've had these for just over a month now and they work as intended. They're light so you don't even know they're there and they're comfortable. Only fitment issue I've had are that the size/shape of the ear bud is just big enough that it doesn't quite fit properly in my ear canal. At first I thought it was the silicon bulbs but the problem still persisted even after I swapped the bulbs from my old ear buds which fit me perfectly and never came loose. I compared the size of these ear buds to my old pair and these were a touch bigger. If I'm just sitting down they stay seated in my ear canals fine, it's when I'm moving around that they come loose and the noise cancelling effect is diminished. Not a big deal but just a concern if you feel as though you have smaller ear canals.The buttons are a bit too easy to activate. It would be nice if they were a bit firmer or required a more deliberate push to activate the intended function. It's too easy to bump something or if I reach to adjust the headset on my neck I will accidentally tap a button when grabbing for the headset.The sound quality is so-so. This is my first pair of Bluetooth earbuds so I can only compare to my old wired earbuds which sound great, IMHO. I've never really heard much bass, and the sound overall is a bit hollow (if that makes sense?) and on the tinny side. Adequate but nothing special.I've used this headset with a Samsung Galaxy S and now with a Galaxy SIII, along with my wife's HTC Windows phone and it paired fine with all three. The only functionality issues I've had with both Galaxy phones is that I will hit the play/pause button to pause music and then if it sits paused long enough, when I hit the play button again it won't restart the music. When I look at the phone I see that each time I hit the play/pause button it's actually skipping to the next song but never actually plays it. I have to start the music on my phone again and then the play/pause button functions properly. I'm using PowerAmp on my Android phone as my music player so it may be an issue with PowerAmp as much as it may be an issue with the headset. I haven't tried it with any other media player on my phone to determine which is to blame. I only used them once for a brief time on my wife's Windows phone so I didn't thoroughly test out the full functionality on that phone.I've used these when walking/jogging, mowing the yard, riding my motorcycle, and just working around my house. They're always comfortable and I sometimes forget they're even there until I bend over or lean back or do something that causes the headset to slide up my neck or fall off my neck. I've had a few times where I've been wearing them while sweating profusely and so far, so good, they're doing okay.If I could make one improvement to the headset it would be to put some sort of rigid beam in the actual headset so that you can actually form the headset to stay in fitted position - picture a piece of wire hanger running through the headset - so you can manipulate the shape a bit and have it stay in that shape. This would be a huge benefit when I'm riding my motorcycle.Speaking of using them on my motorcycle. I searched the reviews as I purchased these specifically for use when riding my motorcycle and several reviews said they worked great on their motorcycle and didn't have any problems. I have to respectively, but vehemently, disagree with each and every one of them. I ride a sportbike and wear a full face (non-modular) helmet and a leather jacket with a bit of a collar. My first few rides I put on my jacket and put the headset on the outside of my jacket and the thing flew all over the place and smack up against my helmet, and if it wasn't blowing around, whenever I would turn my head to do a lane check, or look down to check my speed I routinely bumped a button causing an undesired result. I tucked the headset in my jacket and it still randomly tapped a button when I moved my head around or the headset just happened to shift in an unfortunate manner and would press up against the jacket collar. The only way I can wear these when riding my bike is to turn them backwards (opening is on the back of my neck) and flip'em upside down and then tuck the front into my collar and leave the sides (where the buttons are) exposed above my collar. It works but this is the main reason I would love to have some sort of semi-rigid spine in the headset that would allow me to bend and form the headset around my neck to keep it from flapping around. I'm still trying to think of some way to fit something to the headset to allow me to form it securely around my neck. I'm not knocking the headset for this, just sharing my experience that this may not work for you if you intend to wear them while on your motorcycle.I have yet to use them to a point that they've clearly run out of battery power. At most I've got them on for about 30-35 minutes at a time once or twice a day. I just tend to charge them about once every 7-9 days just to avoid them actually running out of juice when I really wanted to use them. For this reason I won't really comment on battery life.For the desire of the headset having some rigidness for mold-ability I knocked off a half-star - not that the headset doesn't function properly, just that this would be an improvement I think a lot of people would appreciate. The other 1-1/2 stars is for the too-easily-activated buttons and the okay sound quality. Firm up the buttons and improve the speakers and this is a solid 4-1/2 star product.**UPDATE** 9/3/2013:Just wanted to update this review after owning these for so long...Since last March I started jogging/running pretty much every day for 30-45 minutes outdoors along with going to the gym to lift weights several days a week. I've logged hundreds of miles on these earbuds and happy to say, despite all the sweat these things have seen, they're still working great. The charge still seems to last the same as well, I've only fully drained them a few times after multiple uses for varying amounts of time. One thing I've discovered is sometimes, depending on the pace of my jog, the headset tends to bounce around a bit and will hit against my collar bones. It isn't truly painful but definitely irritating after awhile. Additionally, when jogging, the same pace which causes them to bounce off my collar bones also causes the headset to shift around on my neck so I am constantly re-adjusting them to not be lopsided to one side or the other. These two traits only serve to reinforce my original suggestion of some form of rigidness to the spine of the headset. If you're a runner this may be of some concern for you; still nothing I would consider a deal-breaker, but felt it noteworthy nonetheless.Additionally, since my original review, I've also picked up an ASUS TF-700 tablet. The headset has an issue with connecting with the tablet; it works, but each time I pair the 2 I have to go into the Bluetooth settings and tap the headset entry to manually begin the pairing process as opposed to just turning on the Bluetooth antenna and the LG headset then waiting for the automatic pairing to take place. Additionally, and this is a ding against the tablet but related to the headset, ASUS, for some reason, decided to have Bluetooth and wi-fi share the same antenna. If you like to stream anything from the Internet - Netflix, YouTube, etc. - the audio will not be in sync; about a solid half-second delay in the characters' mouths moving and the dialogue being heard through the headset. If I intend to watch any streaming videos through my tablet I make sure to have a pair of wired earbuds with me. This is not an issue when watching videos stored on the tablet itself or an inserted memory card. Again, not a fault of the headset, just noting the issue.",3.0,1342137600,"07 13, 2012",LG Tone Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange,105.97,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JnHbj9SmL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 830},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

B0052YFYFK,A3I04RM049YS8Y,Jeffrey Stanley,"[0, 1]","What I like:Call quality is acceptable. As good as any other wireless headset I've used and far better than my Sennheiser MM400s. The vibrating neckband is killer.I like having an analog on/off switch. This is missing on nearly everything these days.The form factor is great. I wear it everywhere under my shirt collar in a business casual environment. Hints of wires would be visible if you are wearing a more formal white business shirt, but my collared polo and sport shirts hide it well. The form factor is why you should buy this and why you will love it. As I stated before, I own the superior Sennheiser MM400 which has amazing audio quality. I rarely have the MM400 with me because it is not designed to wear as a business accessory. The form factor of these is perfect. Absolutely perfect. These will go with you everywhere. You will not look like a gadget spaz like the guys using the normal bluetooth accessories. When wearing the buds, you are wearing plain buds. They easily tuck away under your collar when not in use. The only bad thing about the aesthetics is the flashing blue light, but this is concealed by your collar.What I don't like:Unfortunately, the stereo sound quality is pretty poor. They don't sound as good as stock iPhone/iPod buds. They sound like cheap $10-$20 buds. Highs and lows are clipped. They funnel all sound into the muddy mids. Imagine a stock FM car stereo from 1984. I'd gladly pay $200 more for this form factor with the sound quality of my Sennheiser MM400s.Conclusion:Buy these. Buy them now. For &lt;$50, they are a great value and you will use them every day. I gave them 3 stars but they really almost merit four when you consider how flippin' cheap they are.For listening to music in a less-portable more-conspicuous form factor, buy yourself a pair of good quality Sennheisers (wired or bluetooth, they are the best for sound quality).",3.0,1342915200,"07 22, 2012",LG Tone Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange,105.97,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JnHbj9SmL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 830},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

Had trouble with garble from my HTC EVO LTE, but found conflict between Beats EQ on Phone and EQ on headset. Turned off headset EQ, sound better.3. Connectivity.

Almost all of the good stuff said about this Headset are absolutely true.Especially Good:* Lightweight* Keeps BT radiation further from your brain than most (i.e. BTR is not directly in your ear)* Great sound quality, I am sure there are superior analog buds, but they sound great to me.* I use these for exercise. I wrap the headphones under my necklace to keep the headset around my neck.* Magnetic earbud holders pretty much set a new standard.The Bad:* Serious connectivity issues when listening to streamed music on my phone. Does not work as well with wifi enabled, but this could just be my phone. Tested with Grooveshark and Pandora on a Nexus One.* When Jogging, I use a very small back pack to hold my phone and everything works as expected. When walking with the same backpack, more connectivity issues (wtf is that?!). Oh well, works perfectly fine in my pocket.* Constant blinking blue light when in use or listening to music. Can be annoying when in the dark.* Doesn't work well (for me) when connecting to a PC, either in Windows or Linux (poor sound quality). Did not test with a Mac.I do not in any way regret my purchase at all. Perfect dedicated headset for my phone which was the only reason why I purchased it. I wish streamed music would not cause connection issues, but I have no problem getting more MP3s for my phone so as to avoid these issues. Will test with a kindle fire soon and update this review to see if streamed music still causes issues.",5.0,1328313600,"02 4, 2012",LG Tone Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange,105.97,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JnHbj9SmL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 830},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"
B0052YFYFK,A1X1CEGHTHMBL1,jjceo,"[1, 1]","I purchased these for my wife because she likes to listen to audio books a lot.  She is constantly complaining about catching her earphone cables on things as she works around the home so I thought this would be a nice gift. The first thing she said is that they were comfortable to wear and she really didn't even know she had them on.The sound out of them is pretty good and the dynamic range is not bad at all.  She uses them on her iPhone and iPad 2 to listen to music and audio books.  Now she can lay her phone or iPad 2 down in the kitchen and walk about 35 feet away in any direction with very good reception.  This includes shooting the Bluetooth signal through 2 walls.  At 40 to 45 feet the sound starts breaking up and at 45 feet it just loses connection.  As you walk back into range it immediately reconnects to the source.The headphones can connect to two devices but only one of them can be a phone.  Set it up with your phone first and then use the manual linking method to set it up with a playing device only, like an iPad.The earphones come with a recharger pack and they charged very quickly.  You can listen to music or talk on the phone 10 hours before needing to recharge.The headset has multiple buttons for your use while wearing the device.  There is an on/off switch, volume up/down rocker switch, a call switch that is used for connecting and disconnecting from calls and pairing the headset to your device and a microphone all located on the LH side. The call button also has a blue LED ring around it that is a solid blue when the headset is searching for a pairing device and it flashes blue when it is in normal operating mode.  While charging, the headset is off and the blue ring turns to red.  When the charger is connected the headset turns off regardless of what position the on/off switch is in. There is also a charging port on the inner side of the LH part of the headset.  On the RH side there is a Rew/FF button, and a play/pause button.  The earplugs magnetically fit into the headset when not in use.The LED ring around the call button can also help you to determine the amount of charge left in the headset.  If you press and hold the call button for 3 seconds the LED ring will light up for 1 second.  Solid blue means high charge, violet means medium charge and red means low charge.While playing music you can skip forward or back one song or chapter by quickly pressing the REW/FF rocker switch.  If you hold the switch you can speed forward or back as long as you hold the switch down.  You can answer a call, transfer a call, voice dial, recall the last number dialed, end a call, go to call waiting or reject a call all by using the call button.  Remember your phone device must be able to handle these types of actions for them to work.Our unit came with two different sets of ear buds that looked like medium and large.  Make sure that you use the set that best fits into your ear for comfort and also for good noise blocking.  It will also help you to get the best sound as most of the audio output will be directed into your ear and give you the best sound.  If they are too loose then part of the sound is lost and you will not get the best sound fidelity.The unit also features a bass boost that can be turned on.  If you press the up and down volume rocker switch on both sides for 1 second it will switch between normal EQ or Bass Boost.  You will hear a beep in the headset when the change is made.Cons:Some items on the device seem fragile as the headset is really a high tech miniature piece of electronics.  The flap that covers the charging port for example just seems excessively fragile.There is the geek effect in that you have this ring around your neck and there is a flashing blue light going when you have it turned on.  You forget you are wearing it but people do look at you sort of strangely.One thing that I did not like is that when we received the unit we noticed that the internal box that contained the headset had been opened before we got it.  The special sealing tape from the factory had been cut and the wall charger plastic bag had been opened.  In addition there was an empty bag for another set of ear buds.  When we purchased the unit it was supposed to be new and the fact that it was opened indicated that it had either been returned or opened in the warehouse.  I don't care for that as I paid for new merchandise but the unit has performed well so far.  I didn't deduct any stars for the opened box as it does not reflect on the product but it certainly does on the seller!Overall we like the headset and I would recommend it to you!",5.0,1335484800,"04 27, 2012",LG Tone Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange,105.97,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JnHbj9SmL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 830},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"
B0052YFYFK,A1VQBEW0G4IH1J,J-J-J-Jinx!,"[0, 0]","I've tried a bunch of bluetooth headsets and this one is the best one I've found so far. They are good for biking, rollerskating, erging (rowing on a stationary rower) and walking all over the place to do errands.Since the bulk of the headset rests around your neck, the earbuds are really light, which helps them stay in your ear. I did end up putting my own silicone tips on them because the ones that come with didn't fit me quite right, but I usually have this problem with most silicone earbud tips.When I first got these, I never really used them to talk to people, in fact I wasn't even pairing them with my phone. Then one time I did have them paired to my phone and I heard a noise and pressed a button and what's this? I'm having a conversation with someone on my phone! I was riding my bike in traffic at the time, had no idea what I was doing and yet was able to answer the phone, have a conversation and then hang up afterwards, so I'd say the controls are pretty intuitive. I've used some other headsets where buttons do a lot of different things, since there just aren't that many buttons, but these let you answer the call on your left, pause your music with the right, raising and lowering volume is on one side, going forward and back on tracks is on the other. I really find it easier to navigate than the styles that try to be smaller and more compact.They do move around sometimes. Especially when riding my bike, they will EVENTUALLY start twisting to the side so by the time I've finished a ride and removed my sling bag, sometimes they are completely out of place and maybe hanging off my back on one side. Meanwhile, of course the earbuds will have fallen out. When they do come out, though, there is never a yanking out from the ears as I've experienced with other headsets with earbuds. The earbuds also come out of their magnetic holders sometimes, but overall they stay put pretty well.I will often be wearing these when I get wherever I'm going walking or biking and I don't find people staring at them strangely or even seeming to notice them much, which I think it a plus.The sound is decent quality and there is some noise cancelling going on. I sometimes wear just one ear at a time, especially if I'm in traffic or I just want to hear what's going on around me. I do find that weird head movements (especially biking or maybe rooting around in my bag while on the train) can sometimes cause buttons to be pushed, like all of a sudden I guess I've pushed the pause button with my chin or turned the volume up/down when twisting around.I sometimes lose the connection for a moment or off and on depending on where the phone is in relation to the headset. On my bike, I've had pretty good luck with it when the phone is in a pannier on the back of the bike, but sometimes when it's in a bag on my back, I lose the signal. It seems to help when I put my iPhone 4s into the outside pocket of my bag, upside down. Lately, I've done even better by getting a little bag that fastens to the front of the top tube of my bike frame (up by the fork.)Cycling JFLY Roswheel Frame BagIt's meant to hold a phone and not only does it maintain my bluetooth connection but I can actually look at my phone to do things like find out what time it is.The customer support from LG is not very good. I was having trouble pairing my headset with my phone at one point (it just wasn't working) and the LG support site had a list of all these different electronic items so you could find yours and get an automatic service/return request and this headset wasn't on the list so it required actually being on hold and talking to a human and asked some silly questions before being given instructions for sending in the headset (with me paying for shipping.) Then I didn't hear anything from them for a while, then one day my headset showed back up with a note that seemed to be saying I forgot to put my proof of purchase in with the headset so they didn't work on it BUT I tried it again and it seemed to be working so...whatever, I don't know. It's out of warranty now as I write this anyway, so not something I have to worry about any more! At least it's working, but if it wasn't, unless something better has come along in the meantime, I'd probably buy another of this same style because of it's multiple activity uses, general ease of use and fairly long battery life.Oh, I should also mention that I have sweated on it quite a bit and that hasn't seemed to affect it at all.",4.0,1381017600,"10 6, 2013",LG Tone Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange,105.97,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JnHbj9SmL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 830},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

B0052YFYFK,A2N6ROIO1VNOET,"J. Miller ""Scientist""","[0, 0]","I've only had these for 48 hours, but so far I am loving these headphones.  I bought them because I had broken 3 wired pairs in the past 2 months, all at the base where they plug into my iPhone.  I'm not an audiophile, but I'd say the sounds quality is great; comparable to the $20-$25 headphones that I usually buy and I was surprised that the phone call quality is better than my dedicated Plantronics Discovery 975 bluetooth headset which cost me twice as much.  Though I haven't tried it in a noisy environment yet.  I plan on getting a lot of use out of these as I use them for both work and play so I'll update my review if anything goes wrong or any issues develop.My only issue so far is that I wish it came with some sort of carrying case because they can get caught on things if you throw them in a bag.  I don't want to put undue pressure on the wires.  I think any heavy zip-lock or cloth bag would work for this though so I'm sure I won't have trouble finding something around this size to offer a little protection.On a side note, I don't know where these shipped from, but I ordered using Prime and they were on my doorstep 18 hours later as I was leaving for work, so I have to say I'm very happy with amazon shipping.  One note on the packaging; I saw some reviewers say they had a difficult time opening the packaging, but I found it very easy.  You just cut the 1 inch tape tab on the bottom of the box and it opens like a clam-shell.  No other cutting, pulling or forcing required.  Maybe they heard the complaints and updated the package.UPDATE: After a couple of weeks I'm still really enjoying these.  I've found that they are a little strange to run with so I use regular workout headphones for that, but for work, they are wonderful.  No more keeping a bluetooth headset in one ear and a headphone in the other when I'm expecting a call; I like being able to answer calls on the fly without removing the headphones.  I saw that some people had an issue with an occasional skip in audio.  I do get this occasionally, maybe once or twice a day, but it doesn't really bother me enough to worry about.

It sits very comfortably on your neck and you actually forget that it is there.I was afraid that the ear piece will not fit well in my ears cannel but that concern turned to be not-relevant. They are very comfortable in my ears and can sit there for long time without causing irritation feeling.Another concern that I had was with the connection of the ear piece with the tiny wire to the base of the headset. So far it works fine and proved durable. I hope that it won't tear apart on an accidental pull.The only thing that I would change is the blinking blue light while it operates.

As with all of the others, they lose the connection thoughout the day. I'm sitting at a desk two feet from the laptop or tablet. And, I've had numerous laptops, tablets, phones etc. - same results - I don't get it. Windows or Mac or Android - or even Nokia - made no difference.I have to conclude Bluetooth is not ready for prime time. And, I will not buy another Bluetooth headset - nope not again. All I need is for the headset to maintain the connection so that I can make and receive skype calls throughout the day - that's it. I don't want to have to reconnect if someone calls or if I want to make a quick call. I don't get it - why can't this be accomplished.And, I really liked these. All the weight is in the part that rests - unnoticed - on your neck. And, when the ear buds fall out - as they inevitably do - they're right there a few inches from your ears so it's fast and easy to reinsert them.It's a brilliant design. And, when it was working - it worked very well. And, for music probably fine - good sound. Good range too.The magnet thing too is super clever. When the ear buds are not in your ears, they naturally get sucked into the ends via some magnets so they don't go flopping around. That's clever.Lastly, in terms of durability, I'm not sure these would have lasted all that long in my backpack anyway. They do seem a little fragile. I'm going to stick with my last set of BT - the Plantronics BackBeat 903+  They also lose connection all the time too but I didn't return those in time.

Bought the headset to use with myApple MacBook Pro MD311LL/A 17-Inch Laptop (NEWEST VERSION)to listen/control books on iTunes while working out on myNordicTrack Sequoia Skier (Ski Machine). It worked at first. In less than a month the headset was more and more difficult to pair/connect to my MacBook Pro. Sometimes, it would lose connection while in use.

I agree with other users who have recommended only using one bud and leaving the other ear open - It is better for safety as the buds block much of the external sounds, and being able to switch buds during long calls helps to avoid ear discomfort.The only reason that I am not giving the LG five stars is that I have only had it for about a month, so I can't yet rate reliable quality over the long haul.

Wang,"[0, 0]","I held out from buying Bluetooth headsets for a long time after my last pair (Motorola I believe) gave me too many issues during college from dropped signals. With LG scoring massive praise and high reviews, I finally thought I would jump in a deal offered by Newegg. I brought these headphones with me to the Philippines, after testing them for two weeks in Seattle with fairly decent results.At first the range was good with the headphones. I could leave my phone in one room and get up to fifteen feet away while receiving a good signal. Maybe eight feet with a wall between us. This was pretty good, the sound quality was great and noise isolation was acceptable.However, once I arrived in the Philippines I started having larger issues. My phone was unable to play to the headphones without skipping around a lot while I was exercising. Also, I found that the headset itself likes to jump around a lot, resulting in a bruised collar after about a mile of jogging nonstop. This was later partially solved by wearing a shirt with a smaller collar and placing the unit underneath, but I was still unable to listen to music without holding my phone in my hand within three feet of the unit.I became fed up with this after the third week that I've since thrown the headset into my luggage and refuse to acknowledge its pitiful existence. I've tried many things, from charging to testing from alternative sources and it has not given me the performance I was hoping for.

I can't do ""behind the neck"" style as I have a very thick neck, and this I can leave outside my shirt collar.Audio quality is quite good, and battery life is phenomenal. You practically forget it's there. Charge it in the morning, and even if you use it all day you'll only run out of juice just before you go to bed, and that's with HOURS of listening to podcasts, taking and making calls, etc.The magnet tips are very cool as they ""take"" the ear buds back so they don't wrap around your neck.Two problems, however, marred its existence.1) It only wants to pair to ONE host at a time. I have both a laptop with Bluetooth, and a smartphone. I really want the headset to pair to both so I don't have to swap things back and forth. Unfortunately, this cannot be done with this particular headset. It's either-or, not both.2) Months after purchase and almost daily use, the left earbud broke in half at the seam. Seems the glue just ""popped"". I glued it back together with superglue, but it seems I lost a wire connection as there's no more sound from the left bud, even though I detect no wire break.Oh, and you'll very likely lose one or both of the ""retainer rings"" that hooked the wire back to the main loop. I did. It's not critical, but it's likely that you'll end up yanking the wire too hard and thus rip the bud out of the body if you're not careful.For $60 or so, this is a very good stereo headset.

Stays on neck all day without even noticing and is ready to use as needed.  Great quality which allows for flexibility with movements.  Perfect Perfect design with magnet-ed earbuds safely tucked away when not in-use.  Sound quality is great as well and no problems with callers on other end, so microphone also has great location!  Cant believe I waited so long to try Bluetooth, and this headset is proving to be a nice welcome.  Stupid me thought BT had to be glued to ear all day, which kept me away from BT for so long.  No longer will I use wired headsets, the freedom these provide is amazing.  Battery is also superb for my use where I typically charge every other day.  Battery has yet to go completely dead even after using with phone after several days.  I probably use about 1-2 hours MAX of actual talk-time each day.  The only small downside is with Bluetooth enabled on phone most of the day it does cause a noticeable  battery drain on the phone:(  However I'm now getting into habit of turning off Bluetooth on phone during long periods of stand-by and turning back on after answering call.

Sure, the bass function isn't much of a real bass, and the ear bud cables are just a tad too short. But for me, these concerns have been minor. For design, I'd give 4 stars. After 4 months, it's still holding up well, too, despite numerous drops on the ground and falling asleep many a night with it around my neck!I initially awarded 2 stars for performance, after having the unit for about 3 weeks. It seemed at the time that the range and strength of the Bluetooth radio was lessening significantly. However, this proved to be an issue with my iPhone--not the headset--and was easily solved with a reboot of the phone. So here I am correcting my initial review and going back to a full 4 stars!Update 2013/06/18: Still going strong. My chin sometimes toggles the forward/back rocker on the right side when I turn my head too far and scrunch my shoulders a bit (for whatever reason). It's a minor annoyance.

I can usually wander about two rooms away before losing my connection.The sound quality is excellent on phone calls or listening to music.  People on the other end can't tell I'm on a wireless headset.  I also like the magnetic ear bud holders although the bright orange is a little loud.The build quality is excellent, except for the ear buds where they come out of the neck piece.  They need to reinforce the wires.  My hbs-700 headsets have all failed at that specific location.  Regardless, I get very good wear from these headsets.  (typically I've gotten about 6 months out of a headset, 7 days a week 12 -18 hrs a day, running wires, crawling under desks, taking apart computers, replacing hard drives, etc.)I've probably owned 20 different sets of bluetooth headsets.  These are hands down the best bluetooth headsets out there with the exception of hbs-730.  At $60, these LG headsets easily blow away headsets that cost twice as much. They are MUCH better than plantronics, motorola, jabra etc.I've seen some headsets connect by a small wire, and have been tempted, then realized this is a better design.  Here I can take the ear buds out of my ears, and I have a place for them that protects them, but keeps them handy.By the way, the headsets vibrate when a call is coming in, so you can tell your phone is ringing even if the ear buds are in their magnetic holders.If you are looking at the hbs-730, it differentiates itself from the hbs-700 with voice feedback that tells you you've answered a call, or that your bluetooth is connected, or disconnected.  It also vibrates twice when it loses connection with your phone, or gets connected with your phone.The headsets come with 3 different sizes of ear buds, so even the smallest ears and biggest ears will be comfortable.They are a little bit nerdy, but they also command a lot of respect.  I find that when I'm out and about on a very casual Saturday wearing  raggedy shorts, a torn t-shirt, flip-flops, unshaven, and with my long hair down instead of in a pony tail, people still call me Sir and Mr. MyLastName.  I was real surprised to find myself being treated so respectfully until I realized I had my hbs-730 headset on.  I guess it just screams expensive high-tech, so the person wearing it must be a person of means who can afford to look his worst.  ;-)Try them, you'll love them.PS.

I returned the 730 and got another 700 for my wife.  I had a 700 for over 1 year and still love it and working and the tiny wires are still in good shape and I thought it would be torn easily.  Well, I got this 700 last week from a 3rd party seller on Amazon which does the fullfilment and the price was much cheaper, instead of $79, I think it was like $56.  When I got it, the box was torn slightly and must have been opened before.  Charged it and the sound was tinny also but when I tried to do the bass boost, it does not work and there is NO sound or tone reminder going from normal to bass boost and vise versa.  I checked with the first one that I bought and the sound reminder was there.  That is why I think this one is a fake unit, and I have seen them when I was in China.  We I do not understand is that if it is fullfilled by Amazon, why is the box opened and torn.  Something smells fishy.  I can guarantee that there are tons of fake units out there and even selling on Amazon.  Well, i called Amazon and complained and they gave me a discount coupon and I bought another 700 that is sold and fullfilled by Amazon.  This white one is only $44 and the black one is $79!  I do not understand at all.  Finally, I got this white one and everything works, including the bass boost and range is good. So, after weeks or month of trouble I finally got myself, my wife the LG HBS 700.  The form and function for this unit is the best in the market.  Oh, in between I also bought her a Plantronics Backbeat GO2 with sound good but has not vibration alert for incoming call.

I would wear them while golfing sometimes and the Bluetooth would start to cut out around 20-25 feet, but otherwise absolutely no problems ever if phone is kept close by.

I would recommend some sort of way to have the wires extend and withdraw inside of the headphone base, but overall a wonderful product I am very happy with.

Based on user reviews and the overall design I thought this would be the winner.  Well everyone is right about design, audio quality, music features and comfort.  Very well designed and thought out.  The general design of having all controls on the neck band is brilliant and for those who want a great Bluetooth streaming audio headset you will be happy if not delighted.

It's also pretty lightweight, making it very comfortable to wear. The sound quality is excellent for this price and the type of headphones. What's also great is that when you plug them into your ears they also work as ear protectors, since they isolate your ear quite well. Another great feature is the call vibration alert, which makes the headset vibrate in case you get a call. But how is the call quality? Well, I got to say that it's decent. Granted, a phone connection will only provide a certain amount of quality, but that's unavoidable, so no points off there. Also there seems to be very little lag in between the phone (Nexus 5) and the headset, so that's a plus. In terms of battery life, I found that those headphones hold about 10 hours before beeping for power, and that's plenty of time. It also recharges pretty quickly over any micro USB cable, therefore making it fairly practical in case you need to quickly charge it up with your laptop.One thing I did notice though is that you may look a bit weird wearing them because it looks a bit like a collar.

B0052YFYFK,A2M1ZV1949CUQK,Mr. Bill,"[1, 1]","I purchased the LG HBS-700 Bluetooth Stereo Headset in August 2011 from another retailer. I paid $48.70 with tax. My purpose was to listen to music while driving overnight when everyone else would be sleeping. I know it's against the law to use headphones/headset in both ears in most states but I am an avid mirror watcher so I took the risk. It made my driving duties bearable. And it transmitted Google map driving directions as well. The only drawback to using with Google maps is if you had a long period of time between last transmission/instructions such as long interstate driving it may miss the first part of the transmission. When driving around Chicago using secondary roads it worked very good.This headset sounds better than any cable/wired ear-buds I own. I have the Altec Lansing BackBeat Pro UHP606 with armature micro speakers which ran $99 new, Altec Lansing UHP106 with Ultimate Ears Technology, Skullcandy's Ink'd versions (1) and (2), the Apple earbuds included with the both the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5.Nothing compares to the sound and ease of using the LG HBS-700. The headset sits around your neck resting on your shoulders. You can put your phone in your pocket and control the audio or phone functions without removing it. The only time you would need to hold your phone is if you want to change your audio source such as going from Slacker to Pandora or when you need to make a call. You just can beat the freedom this headset gives you vs. being tethered to your phone by a cable. This makes working out, running or walking a breeze. The earbuds stay in great most of the time even after I start to perspire. The only problem I have had was when I perspired too much after about (3) miles and the play/pause button or fast forward/reverse controls did not work properly. After a few hours they worked again. So this headset is not perspiration proof but it did not suffer a permanent function problem. I wouldn't try wearing them in a rainstorm or they probably would suffer a meltdown.Pairing this headset to a Bluetooth source device is very easy. Takes only about (15) seconds the first time on an iPhone. It automatically pairs about 98% of the time when you turn on the Bluetooth enable source the next time. If it does not pair, I usually just turn off the power and then turn on again. 2% of the time I need to go into Bluetooth setting on the phone and manually pair it. This device has a range of about 30 feet and it works good when leaving a room going into another with walls in between. The headset can also pair over multiple sources/devices. I have a Logitech Bluetooth Boombox which must be manually paired if I am attempting to use it with another Bluetooth enabled device if it was not the last device it had been paired with.One of the BEST features of the LG's is the ability to activate loudness by holding BOTH the volume up and down at the same time WHILE YOU ARE LISTENING TO AUDIO. It will not activate until you hear some type of audio. When activated it beeps in your ear once. The sound just seems to jump at you after activating loudness feature.I still average about (10) hours listening to audio 1.5 years after purchase with the loudness always on before I need to recharge them. It takes between 2-3 hours to charge them fully using the included AC plug. The included AC charger is a 5.1 Volt Output at 0.7 amps. I have also used an AC Apple 5 Volt Output at 1.0 amp sugar cube charger with a USB to micro USB cable I purchased separately. And if on the go with no AC/DC charger, I have used a New Trent IMP50D Portable/External Battery with Output of both 5 Volts at 1 amp and 5 Volts at 0.5 amps using the same USB to micro USB cable. I use the 1.0 amp side to charge the iPhone while also using the 0.5 amp to charge the LG headset. But you cannot use the LG headset while it is charging. I  have also used a Mediabridge Dual USB Car Charger putting out 1.0 amps. This car charger can put out 2.1 amps on one USB but I have not tried to use that one with headset. I use the 2.1 for my iPhone and it charges very quickly. I have experienced no problems with the headset using a source that puts out more than the included AC charger which puts out only 0.7 amps.The headset has controls on both the left and right sides. Those on the left side control volume up/down, a dedicated answer call/hang up call button and as stated above activate loudness function by holding up/down volume controls at same time. You can also use voice commands if your phone supports it by briefly pressing the dedicated answer call/hang up button. Last number redial, just hold the dedicated call answer/hang up button for one second and the headset makes the call for you. And before I forget, the headset vibrates when your phone rings if you are listening to audio. Great idea. The power on/off switch is on the outside of the left arm. The charging port is located on the inner side of the left arm behind swinging mini door. The right side has rewind/fast forwarding tracks and dedicated play/pause button.As far as phone call quality, I have never had a complaint while using this headset as a Bluetooth phone headset. The microphone is built into left side of headset. If you are only using only one earbud for calls use the LEFT side one. Otherwise if the left one is attached via the magnet to the headset it can hamper/block your voice from being heard clearly by the caller on the other end as the microphone sits just behind the left earbud where it attaches by the magnet. As a comparison, I have a top of the line Plantronics 975 Bluetooth headset which can only be used for phone calls. It ran $129 + tax when it first came out and I frequently receive complaints when using it for phone calls.CONS: The included AC Charger wire frayed just behind where the cable goes into the plug and you can see the colored interior cable. I used it only about 20-30 times and wrapped the cable around the charger for storage before it frayed. I taped mine up using electrical tape and it still works. Also where the earbuds sit when attached by the magnets is yellow/orange in color which stands out when you are using the earbuds. I see the new model HBS-730 is gray in color which is an improvement but I wonder why it is not black like the rest of the headset.Last CON is the only way you can see the present charge of the headset is to hold down the left volume control for (3) seconds. A HIGH charge is indicated by a solid blue for one second around the dedicated call answer/hang up button, violet for MEDIUM charge and red for LOW. You can't see percentages anywhere. If you see violet, charge your device immediately is my suggestion. I have gone from violet to red during a 1/2 hour walk and the unit starts beeping in your ear. It beeps more often the lower the charge and just plain turns off when it dies leaving you with no way to listen to audio at all short of your speakerphone on your phone.",5.0,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",LG Tone Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange,105.97,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JnHbj9SmL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 830},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

On top of that, the battery seems to last forever, they vibrate when a call comes in, and you can barely tell they are there when not in use. Stereo sounds great, using just 1 earbud works great. Lots of volume. No one has EVER complained or mentioned mic quality when on calls.I have been using them for 2.5 months and no one has ever commented on ""what is that around your neck."" I always wear collared shirts and tuck them under the collar, or inside my shirt.I have these few complaints- the magnets aren't strong enough and the earbuds are too large to lay on comfortable in bed (I know, who does this?). With just a casual bump, the earbuds fall out of their home. This has yet to irk me, but I think it might bother others. There are these cool, breakaway cable holders that make the earbuds easy to find if not in their home and yet let the cable go in case you catch them on something. Like I said, I have very small ears. To keep from bugging my wife, I use earbuds in bed before sleep. I can't use these because the earbuds themselves are quite large. I use Altec Lansing blitz earbuds for bedtime, and when and if these earbuds die, I'll soilder(sp) the smaller earbuds onto the wires. Like I said, it doesn't bug me when the earbuds don't lock in to their home, so this change won't bother me if I ever need to do it.Orange is ugly, but a sharpie will fix this.Work great on walks and in the car. I will only replace for use in the car when Motorola comes up with a newer, streaming model of H730s. You listening, Motorola?You won't regret buying these, especially if you like to have a seperate on off switch, a seperate answer call/end button, a seperate play/pause button, a seperate up and down rocker switch (switches actually), and individual next and last track controls.It did take a while to sort out its use with my car's stereo... which I use to stream my audio through a cable. Once connected to the car stereo, the ipod audio comes out the car stereo. When I take a call, I have to be carefull to answer using the button on the headphones. If I answer on the phone, I hear the person over the speakers, but there is no mic (my stereo doesn't have a mic). If I answer with the earbuds, I can talk and listen to the caller on the earbuds. Then, unforetunately, I have to manually select the car stereo on a menu on my iphone to resume listening there. Not a huge problem, I don't take a lot of calls in the car. I can also just toggle power to the LGs to regain car stereo audio.You can't charge these and use these at the same time... not rare on bluetooth headsets, but regretable I guess.These are great if you are in and out of your car alot. Just listen to music or audiobooks via the LGs, then you have little or no interuption as you get in and out of your car as the battery lasts forever.Lastly, if I had a very important meeting, the earbuds fit in my pants pocket.. I'd hate to do that regularly as it could break the cables. Would work great in a purse I suppose too.",5.0,1330041600,"02 24, 2012",LG Tone Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange,105.97,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JnHbj9SmL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 830},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

B0052YFYFK,A2K5RRMPICZ606,Nathaniel Allen,"[0, 0]","Stellar, lightweight design. But get this: the earbud cords that connect to the unit are just a little lightweight and rubbery. I can tell from the type of material used that these are designed to be sweatproof and should age well, but you'll need to treat them with a bit of respect to avoid tangles, kinks and outright breakage.Sound quality is good enough. I won't pretend to be an audiophile, but I have owned two sets of Sennheiser lanyard-style headphones for previous MP3 players that received excellent reviews for their fidelity, and I have to say that I can't tell a bit of difference versus some stock earbuds that I own -- not when I'm outside, walking the dogs at the park. These LGs are just fine.They're lightweight, and although I thought they'd be uncomfortable (or maybe just annoying) to wear around my neck, they really just ""disappear."" I just have to make sure to set the sliding cord retainers close to the ""pods"" on the neck piece, so as to avoid the buds from pulling out when I turn my head.Charging is quick via the included micro USB -- unfortunately via a port that's covered by a tethered plastic piece that I'm accustom to breaking off after a limited number of uses. Power is handled by a slider switch on one side; volume is handled by an appropriately sized rocker switch on the other. The pause/play button and FFWD/RWD rocker works with Google Music, but not Pandora.I love the concept of the magnetic earbud holders at the ends of this thing, but wish they were stronger. And the magnets don't solve the problem of the loose cord, which is left to snag on something if not stored and handled with respect.Nice sounding headset; a pleasure to be free from the cord!",4.0,1327276800,"01 23, 2012",LG Tone Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange,105.97,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JnHbj9SmL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 830},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

B0052YFYFK,A1N5FSCYN4796F,"Philip R. Heath ""Gadgets, Music, & Books""","[443, 464]","The LG HBS-700 is the third Bluetooth stereo headset that I have used (see my reviews of the Motorola S10-HD andJabra CLIPPER).  As in my other reviews I will focus on the music experience as I use my Motorola T305 for hands free calling.  After pairing this unit with my Droid X, I evaluated it for sound quality, ease of use, and comfort.Sound Quality:  I don't have the strictest standards for music listening, but I haven't had many better listening experiences that I have with the 700.  After changing out the earbuds for the larger set to get a good fit, I was ready to go.  I can't emphasize enough the importance of getting a good seal between your ear and the earbud for sound quality.  I have had this wrong on other earbuds in the past, and the difference in sound quality is night and day.  For clarity of playback the only thing that I have gotten better sound from is my Creative Zen X-Fi with the EP-830 earbuds.  While the 700 doesn't produce booming base, it is rare that earbuds do.  By comparison I think that the 700 has better sound than either the Motorola or Jabra units that I have used.Ease of Use:  This is an area where I think LG has really scored.  The 700 has a dedicated on/off switch, and each of its controls does exactly one thing.  There are dedicated buttons for play/pause, skip, and reverse for controlling your music player.  In addition there are dedicated volume and call buttons too.  Once you learn which side the controls are on, it is very easy to control the 700 without being able to see the controls.Comfort:  If you have used earbuds with no issues in the past, you should have every reason to expect the 700 to be of similar comfort.  I have listened for an hour and a half without giving any thought to the headset I was using.  The unit itself rests like a necklace around your neck.  The only potential issue I could see is that people with long hair may find that it gets tangled in the unit.  If you are concerned about this, I would recommend checking out this unit in person.  As of this writing you can do so at a Sprint store.The one caution I would issue would be around active use.  I don't think the unit is designed to hold up to bouncing around, and it also does seem to be sweat resistant either.  I would recommend the Jabra Clipper for active use.  However I use the 700 while sitting at my desk at work.  It does fine with normal walking around and light activity.  I would just refrain from using it during exercise.Overall:  The LG HBS-700 is a very strong offering.  It hits the mark on sound quality, ease of use, and comfort.  The only downside I see to it is that it was not designed for using during exercise.  Otherwise I think that you will be happy with this unit.",5.0,1291161600,"12 1, 2010",LG Tone Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange,105.97,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JnHbj9SmL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 830},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

They said it didnt sound any different than when we normally talk on the phone.Having this resting around my neck is comforatable so far. It is very light, i can easily forget it's there at all.There are some buttons on either side of the headset near where the earbuds would stick to for the volume and an on/off switch.One kind of annoying thing to me, just a little one is that while the cords to the earbuds in my ear are long enough to easily reach my ears; i find that if I turn my head to much it will cause the earbud to be pulled out.I would have enjoyed them being an inch or so longer, or having a retractable cord inside the plastic.  It is more than ok though, and this is a very minor thing to me, but it is somewhat irritating and I wanted to let others know.  it kind of makes me think of having my neck on a brace in the sense that I am unable to turn it to much without causing myself trouble.Overall I would recommend this to anyone else who needs or wants a blutooth headset for hands free calls while driving, or listening to music while you run or what not.I personally am happy with this product so far, and would buy it again.",4.0,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",LG Tone Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange,105.97,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JnHbj9SmL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 830},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

They were comfortable, light weight, could be easily tucked away when not in use, they were great. There were a couple of issues though. If my phone was in my back pocket, somehow that interrupted the signal and it would fade in and out significantly.I lived with that issue though as the solution was, don't put it in my back pocket. I could accept that. A few months later though, the left ear phone started getting a little &#34;staticky&#34; for lack of a better term. Well about two weeks or so ago, I discovered a short in that ear bud. If I wiggle it around and hold it just right, I can get sound out of it, otherwise though, it is silent. I'm still tolerating it as I usually only use one side anyway (although it used to be the left for the most part). The right one now though is starting to do the same as the left did. I'm pretty sad about it.I really wanted them to work. The concept is fantastic, but the connections to the ear buds seems to be lacking in the sturdiness department.

I replaced a Phillips over the ear waterproof headset, which failed after about 5 months. The LG has better sound quality, longer battery life, MUCH more comfortable fit, and due to the design has larger thus useable buttons. I pair with my Samsung Focus WP 7.5 and they sync fast and have good range. On occasion I get a phone call and the large buttons make answering a breeze, and the mike being around your neck makes for excellent voice quality, I do notice the callers voice volume is a bit lower than the music level but still ok for easy conversation. I charge them every 2 to 3 days, so not sure how long the charge last in terms of hours.The con's:  They only come with one set of spare rubber cups and they are the same size. They are little large for my ear canals, but stay in place once I get them in there. They say they are waterproof (I guess they mean the speakers), but the cover over the charger port doesn't seem to be at all waterproof and is positioned so once you start sweating it lays right against my sweat soaked tee shirt collar, so far no problem but long term???They look like they would be cumbersome hanging around your neck but you really are unaware they are there unless you look in the mirror then they look a little geeky.For the price I don't see how you could beat them.",5.0,1335744000,"04 30, 2012",LG Tone Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange,105.97,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JnHbj9SmL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 830},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

We had the MOST difficult time getting the bluetooth to work with our phone. Upon initial connection, the bluetooth paired seamlessly. Our issue was it would not stay connected. It would disconnect every 15 - 30 seconds and simply say ""bluetooth disconnected"" but would reconnect right away, only to be disconnected again. This was so very frustating! I did some internet research outside the Amazon forum and found that there is a known problem with the HTC and LG interface. There's supposed to be a software push to fix the bug but that obviously hasn't happened yet.Here's how we resolved the issue:1. Wi-Fi has to be turned off on your phone2. Restart Phone3. Voila! Bluetooth Disconnect issue is resolved!I hope this review saves someone the frustration we went through. We returned 3 headsets before the light bulb came on to do some online troubleshooting.

This time, I needed this faster than I would be able to get it via mail - so I bought it from a retailer and paid $10.00 more for it than if I had bought it from Amazon (sorry for going to another retailer on this one Amazon).I am using this product (mainly) on an iPhone 3GS.I am in LOVE with this product.My boss allows me to use my iPhone to listen to podcasts and watch movies (in the background) while I work (as long as I do my job and stay productive!).  Recently, a co-worker moved near my work area and didn't like some of the things that I listen to.  So I went to earbuds.  Worked out great, but the wires were in my way.  So I needed a wireless audio solution.Being a very technical person - my first thought was that if you TRANSMIT something - there will be a DELAY.  So I was concerned that audio/video would not sync up properly.After much research - I chose this product.Turned out to be a GREAT choice!  The audio/video has ZERO delay issues.  Now I HAVE seen a delay problem a FEW times.  I've only had this problem AFTER pairing the device with ANOTHER source.  Something gets out of sync. - but if you go to settings (on the iPhone) and disable the device and then re-enable it - the delay disappears.Now then - a few pro's and con's:Pro's:1.  EASY PAIRING.  My iPhone paired with it quickly and easily.2.  Charges FAST - I think I had it on the charger for around 10 minutes.  The light went out (indicating full charge) and I thought 'wow!  Really?  Already?'.3.  Long battery life.  I haven't had them long enough to say for sure - but they advertise 10 hours of play time.  I've been on them at LEAST 6 hours now and they are doing fine.4.  Very comfortable.Con's:1.  The audio quality is better than expected for a bluetooth device - BUT  - They do NOT match my sony earbuds.  They don't have quite the bass ""thump"" or clarity.  That said - the sound quality IS impressive for a wireless device and it is beyond acceptable - I'd even repeat that impressive is the right word for the audio.2.  There is no 2.  And con number 1 is very minor unless you are a die-hard audiofile.  The sound quality is beyond what I expected for a wireless device.Hope this review helps.

B0052YFYFK,A28UJ9RRG42LNB,Roux,"[7, 7]","I have tried numeerous bluetooth stero headphones, trying to get the perfect mix of sound quality and convenience.Convenience - These are top notch, and a brilliant concept.  I love the fact that I can just put this headset on around my neck, and leave them on throughout the day.  I wear collared shirts to work, so the headset is mostly concealed by my shirt.  I am a large guy with a 22"" neck, and these fit just fine.  My 11 year old son also wore them one day in the car, and they fit his narrow neck just fine too.  These truly are one-size-fits-all.Design - I must give props to the design team here.  This is a very unique take on the stereo bluetooth headset, and I applaud them.  They need to address a few issues on the next model of these though.  The magnetic clips are fantastic, but could stand to be a little stronger.  My earpieces spend more time disconnected from the magnet than they do connected.  Not a big deal, since there is only so far they can stray because of the wire length.  They need to make the cables more durable.  I have worn mine daily for only a little over a month, and I have wires exposed at 3 different points.  The cable insulation can rub off VERY easily.  I have had to resort to ""liquid electrical tape"" to reinforce those areas.  This could also be partly remedied by a re-designing of the departure angle of the cable from the body of the unit.  The cables come out of the unit at almost a straight 90 deg. angle instead of a lower angle, causing more stress on the cables.Battery Life - Stellar.  I consistently get 9.5 to 10 hours of continuous listen / talk time.  Are there any other bluetooth headsets out there with a 10 hour talk time rating?Call Quality - The call quality is not that bad.  It takes getting used to having a phone conversation in stereo, but I got used to it.  All callers said I was very easy to hear, but that a lot of background noise could be heard.Sound Quality - The sound quality was just mediocre to me.  Don't buy these if you want a full sound stage for your music, or if you consider yourself an audiophile.  Buy these for the convenience and the massive talk / listen time.  the phone calls sounded great, but my music (many different styles) sounded shallow, lacking any low-end sound stage.  I even jammed the earbuds in to my ears tightly to see if there was any more bass that could be heard.  None that I could tell.Controls - Very easy to learn and use.  This is the first time that the button placement makes sense to me.  Basically all of your call controls come from the left side, and your music controls are on the right.  I love the fact that there is a slide power switch instead of a ""push & hold"" power button.Summary - I like these alot, but I don't think they are going to last very long.  The exposed wiring through the cable insulation makes me think these will have a very limited life-span.  Overall, I like these much better than my Plantronics Back Beat 903+'s.  I like the ear buds on these versus the traditional ""on-ear"" style of bud that Plantronics uses.  Get these if you want a convenient wireless headset with copius amoutns of talk/listen time, but aren't that concerned with overall sound.  They sound good, but not near as good as other wired earbuds.",3.0,1338854400,"06 5, 2012",LG Tone Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange,105.97,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JnHbj9SmL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 830},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

B0052YFYFK,A3OCIWPCPXNN0I,"Tetsu Noguchi ""tekkster""","[1, 1]","With such a great review from David Parenteau, it would be almost pointless to read anyone else's review, but I'll throw in my two cents.I've owned quite a few BT headsets and headphones, and have always struggled with a few frustrating issues.- Plantronics makes amazing headsets, and for one ear headsets, none are better.  But I find the biggest issue as being...where do I put it when not using it?- Motorola makes amazing sweat proof stereo headsets, but they are rather large, and frankly, if you're not working out, there's in the way.- Many other BT headsets suffer from an inability to connect quickly as you jump from device to device, and while I'm sure there are several exceptions out there, I've never found one.- One thing that is always frustrating:  I'd like to watch videos or listen to music on my iPad, but still answer calls from my cell phone, and it's been annoying that many BT headsets don't have this function.- BT antenna strength has been a problem for me on almost every stereo BT headset, with several intermittent dropouts while listening to music or on a call.If the above are annoyances you have struggled with, then the LG HBS700 may be just the ticket for you.The HBS700 is a bit of a godsend and fairly close to what I would consider an ideal headset.- First off, the BT electronics is separated from the canal phones.  This alone is a huge advantage.  It allow for larger electronics that don't annoy you while listening to music.- Next, the canal phones have magnetic slots to sit in when not in use.  What a great idea!  having a place to put the canal phones when not in use means they're not dangling and more importantly, don't get tangled.- The larger electronics means bigger battery than other stereo BT headphones, and that's a major plus as you can use it all day.- The unique multi-connection means I can watch videos on my iPad, or listen to music from my laptop, and still have it ""cell"" connected to my iPhone to answer calls if need be.  It'd be better if it could do calls on two devices, then I could Skype on one and still answer calls from the cell.  - Still, this feature is pretty amazing.- And it connects fast....I mean, really fast.  I can jump from device to device and discoveries occur within a few seconds and connection another 2-3 seconds.  I can't even imagine how many times I've been annoyed with switching devices.- I've broken or lost more single ear BT headsets than I can count.  Always because I have no place to really put the headset when not in use, what's more, I've missed many calls because the BT headset is buried in my shirt or pants pocket and hard to get out in time.  This can't be stressed enough from my perspective.  These things are never in my ear when not in use, but quick to get in my ear and answer calls.- The antenna is strong, also probably because of the larger electronics in the neck band.five small annoyances:- The neck band is weighted slightly on the right, which always gives a lopsided look.- the rear of the band is too flexible.  I get why they did that, to maximize comfort, but there's a fine balance there, and they err'd on the side of too flimsy, rather than too firm.  Not quite perfect.- The magnets are too weak.  Here again, it's a balance issue.  Too strong would also be annoying, but they could have made it stronger.- Sound quality.  Disagree with just about everyone else here.  The sound quality is just soso.  Good enough, but hardly what I'd call great.  Maybe ""good"" but even that is a bit of a stretch.  Not complaining, mind you, but not ideal by any means.- durability is a major issue with these.  You might get more than a year's use out of them, but don't expect it.  Be happy with 6 months.All in all though, the good far far outweighs the bad, and these will be my new favorite BT headphones for a some time to come.",5.0,1337040000,"05 15, 2012",LG Tone Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange,105.97,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JnHbj9SmL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 830},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

B0052YFYFK,ABJU3MYLBAJ20,The Gadgetman,"[6, 6]","I've tried countless Bluetooth headsets since 2000 with Jabra.  Since then I've tried numerous models, some good, some bad (some real bad).  When the original iPhone came out in 2007, my hunt for a good Bluetooth headset got more serious.  I've tried many of them (Jabra, Morotola, Lubix, Jawbone, Plantronics, etc.) and wasn't happy with any of them.  My last one was Plantronics 975 because I gave up finding a stereo headset that I could be happy with.  It was okay for calls...it was small but I'm not one of those that parade around with a headset in my ear all day, so I had to always find a place to keep it handy to answer calls (and no I didn't want to use a lanyard)So while perusing Amazon last week, I came across this one by chance (honestly I didn't know LG even made them).  I immediately ordered one and got it very next day.  After using it for almost a week, both indoors and outdoors, I have to put this one on top of my list of all time favorite list.  Here are the pluses:- Since all the weight is in the housing that goes around your neck, only thing that goes into your ears is the buds so it's very light and comfortable to have it on.- It comes with 2 sets of ear buds.  I had to use the larger ones for more snug fit.- The whole unit is still light so right after putting this around your neck, you forget you have it around you (funny, this is also a minue).- Works great with Siri (was my biggest concern)- Reception is very good.  I can walk from my home office to the kitchen (~35ft and two walls) and still can have a conversation.- You don't have to memorize a series of complex sequences to use the controls.  It comes with a separate on/off slidern switch, volume up/down, call/answer button (you also use this to invoke Siri) on the left side.  On the right has play/pause button and prev/next track controls.  It only took me 15 minutes to get familar with these controls.- The unit is very comfortable and flexible.- More opportunity to listen to your music without worrying about missing calls...plus you don't look weird wearing it because they look more like stereo music headphones.- It's sleek and easy to conceal it under the collar of your collared shirt.  Just the ends will produce slightly.- The earbuds are magnetized so they snaps into the end of the housing.Now the minuses:- It's so comfortable and light that you forget you have them on. especially when you have the buds stored.- The microphone is located in the left side near the end, so when you have the buds stored it, it blocked by it.- I wish I can turn off the small blue light ring (around the call button).  It does attract attention especially indoors.- If you push the call button slightly longer, it redials the last number (called my boss a couple times...embarrasing).  I wish they made it a little longer.- It does not have noise-cancellation so when using it outdoors, Siri sometime didn't work as expected (but Siri is still Beta).All in all, I'm very happy with this unit.

B0052YFYFK,A1ITUNKZ2QHSX1,W. Tubbert,"[2, 2]","I've had these headphones on my Wish List for some time and finally received them for Christmas this year, and let me tell you something: I had NO idea what I was missing! If I'd realized how great these were, I would have purchased them for myself a long time ago.In the few days I have had them, I've easily used them for several multi-hour sessions (watching movies at night on my Tablet or music on my phone) with NO discomfort. In fact, I find it difficult to find earbuds small enough to comfortably fit my ears for more than a half an hour, but the default installed earbuds fit perfectly! (There is a second, larger set included).On top of that, at night I put on a movie or show on Netflix to fall asleep to, but wear headphones so as to not wake my spouse. Prior to receiving these, my favorite set have been a wired set of Vizio, which, if I rolled to my side, would become uncomfortable in the ear pressed into my pillow, and are often yanked out as the wire would get tangled up as I rolled around in my sleep.These have such a low profile in the ear that there is no pressure or discomfort when laying on my side. Even more impressive is that they remain in place even after moving around in my sleep. I just remove them on my first arousal after falling asleep. Even after using them the night before, I can use them the following day for several hours before recharging them for the next night.Ultimately, I returned this pair (HSB-700) for the similarly (and through some Amazon vendors, even more cheaply) priced Tone+ (HSB-730). I was stunned that the 700 does not include a microphone Mute function on the headset. There are a lot of very convenient control buttons, but found this to be an odd oversight. The HSB-730 includes a microphone mute, a vibration setting, and an increase to the already impressive battery life.PROs:+Extremely comfortable.+Good sound quality.+Great range.+Impressive battery life.+FANTASTIC VALUENEUTRAL:=The thin wire connecting the earbuds to the base may not be as durable long-term as some heavier-duty wired earbuds.=SMS Text Reader app was not personally tested, but Android Play Store reviews seem to indicate that the required app is hit or miss based on your specific device.CONs:-Surprising lack of a microphone mute feature.-Obsolete?

The battery life is excellent allowing you to use the headphones for an entire workday.

All that aside, I've never worn a more comfortable and better sounding bluetooth audio device.However, it has a flaw.The microphone is the weakest point on the device. It clear but has very poor gain. The result is that you will be hard to hear on any phone calls you take with this device.

B0057K6EVC,A3BPAFDOGEQ8J5,Hao Zhang,"[11, 12]","I purchased this phone for use as a backup/spare phone, in case my fancy schmancy Android phone goes out of whack. For $35, it's not too shabby. It costs $50+ with shipping anywhere else, so this was a great deal on Amazon by shopcelldeals.The touch screen is pretty sensitive, it doesn't require a lot of hard pressing unless you encounter a tiny object that needs a bit of accuracy. It uses a resistive touch screen, so it's not going to be comparable to a capacitive touch screen found on fancy touch screen phones, like Android phones and iPhone/iPod touch/iPads. I found it very surprising that the screen was so sensitive; from my previous experience with resistive touch screens, they require me to jam my thumb down on the screen to operate, but this phone had no trouble with the touch operation at all. Using the virtual QWERTY keyboard at first was a bit hard for me since I use an Android phone and an iPod touch 4G, but after getting used to the touch screen, it was easy to type.The features on this phone are quite fulfilling. There are a few smartphone-esque features on this phone, such as a home screen with widgets, a lock screen (sort of), and apps/games capability. The web browser appears to be a full HTML browser; it's easy to navigate around the web, but there is no video streaming capability (YouTube). The music player is pretty good on this device, it scans for all the songs you downloaded to the phone/memory card, and compiles them into a list. The speaker is loud and clear, a lot louder than my Android phone (10/20 volume on this phone is louder than full volume on my Android phone), so this phone is great for anyone who likes to use their phone as a boombox/stereo.The phone comes preloaded with 2 games, Container Block and Castle Defense. Container Block is quite entertaining, you have to find ways to move your container out of the area by moving other containers out of the way. I haven't played Castle Defense yet, but I'm sure it will be just as fun. You can download Java (J2ME) apps onto this phone, by either using the built-in web browser to download directly from app distribution sites, or transfer .jar files to your phone/memory card, then opening the file on the phone. You can use websites such as GetJar, MobileRated, etc. to get apps and games. The games won't be as fancy as smartphone games, but there are some classic games such as Tic Tac Toe, Tetris, and Pac-Man that you can play. I would recommend downloading Opera Mini so you can browse the web better, because the built-in web browser has a few issues with memory and doesn't have some of the features found in Opera Mini.The camera will get the job done for occasional snapshots on-the-go. It's a 2 megapixel camera, so don't expect it to take SLR quality pictures or videos. It also doesn't have an LED flash light, which is understandable since this is a low-end phone. Like any other cameras built into phones, it is horrible under low-lighting conditions, so it's best to just stick to taking pictures under bright light. In order to use the digital zoom option for taking photos, you would have to tune the size down to VGA quality (640x480). The video it records are somewhat decent; again, do not expect it to be high quality. The camera has a few settings such as brightness control, white balance, color effect, timer, continuous shot mode, night mode, etc. so you can shoot photos and videos with a few preferences.Now let's just get on with the miscellaneous stuff. The phone has common tools and utilities like calendar, alarm clock, calculator, tasks and memo pad, stop watch, world clock, voice recorder, and even a unit converter. There's two pages on the main menu, so be sure to swipe over to find the rest of the apps. The battery is a bit small, only holding 900mAh; it's not too bad since this isn't a fancy smartphone, it doesn't use as much power. The phone runs on AT&T; towers, and their EDGE service (theoretical max speed is around 240Kbps, most people only get around half of that). I get 4 to 5 bars most of the time at my house, so if you have good AT&T; reception at where you live, you're good to go. You can send and view MMS messages, so that's not a problem there. You can transfer contacts from another phone by either mashing them into a .vcf file, which is a feature found on most feature/smartphones; or you can transfer them to your phone via Bluetooth.This is a good feature/semi-smart phone for someone upgrading from another feature phone, or using it for a spare phone. It will get the job done if it fits your need, but don't expect it to be comparable to true smartphones (Android, iOS, Windows Phone, etc.)",5.0,1341878400,"07 10, 2012",LG 800G Prepaid Phone (Net10),19.9,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ayhu7OEkL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 70126},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"

She took a few weeks to get use to the touch screen, but would not turn loose of this phone now. Great phone and Net 10 service is really good too. The only thing is the battery is a little short on life, but just buy a car charger set from Amazon.I absolutely love this LG800G! It takes a little getting use to a touch screen from a flip phone, but after a while it is easy to use and great reception. I think it is so nice not having a contract and I pay $50 a month for unlimited talk, text and web.I was a Verizon customer for many years, a VERY UNHAPPY Verizon customer.

B0057K6EVC,A2BH8KZRJDJD3Z,M. Harris,"[25, 31]","The rating of this phone really depends on what you are looking for. If you are looking for an Android, look somewhere else. But if you are looking for something that is like a smartphone in some ways, this is the choice. Personally this is not something I would love and cherish, but if you don't want a fancy phone then this is a good idea. It has internet, texting, and you can download a facebook app. This in some ways is a more basic phone, because it cannot play Youtube videos, nor can it use wifi, and it doesn't have 3g or 4g speeds. And the thing is, it doesn't let you use the on-screen keyboard with the browser. I still can't understand why not, but trust me because of this you will get annoyed. You have to use the keypad, which is like when you dial a phone number, press 1 for letters a,b, or c. Press 2 for e,d, or f. You will find it can get quite annoying. The texting works well, and it does allow you to use the keyboard. You see, this is emulating Androids and iPhones because it has a virtual keyboard, not a slide-out one or anything like that.The facebook app can be tricky at times, and every time you use it you have to switch from the keypad to the keyboard. I don't understand why it just doesn't give you the keyboard to begin with. But maybe that is too much like an Android. There are a few useful things on this phone, like a stopwatch, alarm clock, unit converter, calculator, etc. While this may have the facebook app available, there are not many others. So if you want a phone with apps, do not get this one.Sometimes this phone can act weird, like sometimes the facebook app doesn't work, sometimes it acts weird during texting. I find that my signal goes up and down. Whenever it has all bars, it is fast. But when it has only a few bars, things are really slow. Battery life is okay, but there are plenty of other phones that get better battery life. There are a lot of cases available for this phone, which is a good thing. The touchscreen itself is okay, but not nearly as nice as an iPhone.So compared to an iPhone or any Android, this phone is a joke. But for someone who wants a cheap touchscreen, this is the one to get. The call reception is pretty good too. There are several plans available, all which you have to buy cards for. The most amount of minutes you can get is 750, but there is also an unlimited plan. But with this phone, that really seems like a waste of time. And you will find that the minutes go by fast, especially with texting.Update 5/13/2012I am so glad I switched to the LG Optimus. It may not be the best phone in the world at all, but at least it is better than this phone. I still have this phone, and I, just for the heck of it, turned it on. It's so inferior to an Android device. The minutes went by so quickly, I could never do the large amount of texting I do now. There is an unlimited plan, but why pay $50 for such a cheap device? There are plenty of far better prepaid phones out there for that amount or LESS! The touchscreen is terrible, even my Optimus has a better screen. In fact, its screen is very sensitive, I don't wish for it to be any more sensitive than it already is. But this phone, you cannot type fast, and you always have to turn the screen to use the keyboard. I would suggest you go with a slider phone instead, it is a much better option than this touchscreen. If you want a touchscreen, go with any Android from any prepaid carrier, there are some really nice ones out there, especially at MetroPCS.",1.0,1329436800,"02 17, 2012",LG 800G Prepaid Phone (Net10),19.9,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ayhu7OEkL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 70126},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"

B0060NG6M2,A1CD7IUM2JRPY1,"Alexander V. Ramos ""Doc Taz""","[0, 1]","I don't currently own this phone. Still, I've been able to sort of play with one for a few days. The processor is faster, so in stock form, is more user friendly compared to the V. Memory is still an issue, but like the V, if you only need a few apps, this shouldn't be a problem. Many apps can be moved to the SD card, and yes, the phone can be rooted if needed. The CPU can't tolerate much overclocking or underclocking; it can only go about 50 MHz in either direction before problems arise.I'm basing this review on a few days of use with a phone that I helped my dad choose. He wanted a model with a QWERTY keyboard, as too many touchscreen actions don't appeal to him. I have no plans to root his phone, though I may explain the process to him further if he is seriously interested in it. Otherwise he is happy with the way the phone works, so I don't foresee having to do this for him. If this were my next phone, yes, I would root it. There are a few ROMs available for the Slider, including the Mobster ROM. Most of the devs for these ROMs also don't recommend clocking the processor more or less than 800 MHz. The reason of this is of course the overclockers' classic enemy: heat buildup. Nothing's worse than a phone that turns to toast when you least expect it.All of that being said, it is possible to do a bit more than the usual with this phone. The keyboard can be useful if you run terminal emulators. Remember DOS and GUI-less UNIX terminals? Yeah, you know who you are! Type away all the Linux commands you can remember; most of them work here. :) Games? It does run quite a few well. I tested a 3d golf game, and a motorcycle 3d racer. Both ran fairly smoothly, with little slowdowns. YouTube video ran well, too. Web surfing is quite good for a lower end Android phone. You'll notice it when zooming full size pages to size.In short, this really is an improved version of the V. My only niggle is the lack of LED flash for the camera. At this point, that might break the deal for me, as I am fairly adept at touchscreen typing, after a year of using the V. If you simply need a QWERTY, this is still one of the better deals for a no contract phone in the USA, in mid 2012. The only other model I'd recommend is the Samsung Transform Ultra, which is on Boost Mobile.",4.0,1342310400,"07 15, 2012",LG Optimus Slider Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile),118.26,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CAc9SFrDL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 59693},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones'], ['Sports & Outdoors', 'Fan Shop', 'Cell Phone Accessories']]"

The phone is basically the older Optimus V, which I currently have, with a faster processor (800Mhz vs 600Mhz - I could tell a big difference when using the operating system, it's much snappier now), more internal memory (512MB vs 256MB), a physical keyboard, and Anroid 2.3 (vs 2.2).  It's really a nice phone that you can tell is made well - the fit and finish is really nice.  The keyboard slider works well too - it's a very smooth action that just feels right.  My only complaint for this phone is that it has a fairly small screen of 3.2"". It's just a little on the small side for browsing webpages and such.

B0060NG6M2,A2Y3FNMRNCDFUA,Hamstersadancin,"[1, 1]","Bought the LG Optimus Slider after my prior LG Rumor2 succumbed to water damage.This essentially is my first smartphone since switching from a basic feature phone.Overall experience with the Optimus Slider is mostly positive.Biggest positive for me:Since the Optimus Slider was released  before prices for the Beyond Talk plans increased I get to keep my old BT plan at its original price $25.Phone Experience:First time  with Android it was an easy transition got used it within the first day.Call Quality is quite good far better than LG Rumor2 I can hear people clearly.Speaker quality is very clear making my  MP3's bearable to hear even in noisy places.Battery life was abysmal the first few days. Before I got the phone I purchased 2x OEM BL44JN 1540MAH batteries of which its standard just encase. For the first few days with the OEM batteries I only got around 4 hours of use per battery at the time. Downloaded the Juice Defender app. each battery lasted me atleast 6-7 hours on normal use. Later bought an extended battery 3850mah(still skeptic on the mah 2 1/2x the power of the OEM) from Sporting Persistence. Battery life significantly increased to a days worth.Apps & Storage:Appspace is limited to around 150-160mb's. This forces me to think hard on which apps I want to keep. I remember reading that if I reach its limit the phone will not work properly as intended. So I limited myself to 10 downloadable apps leaving 40mb of extra space to be safe.Most of the apps run fine with no slowdown unless they happen to be emulators with games that require faster processing.Stuck with Gingerbread OS. That means I can't use apps meant for later versions. Also since the LG OS uses the ARM/6 CPU some apps that can be run on Gingerbread may not work if using this processor.Physical Keyboard:it's bigger than my Rumor2's physical keyboard pleasant to type with. However major downside for me is the backlight for  the keys. Unlike the Rumor2 the backlight doesn't stay lit. They automatically shut off a few seconds later unless pressed. I can't find the options if any to keep them lit. So my nightly texts are a bad experience in this regard.Camera:Max Picture size is 3.2mp while video is the old VGA 640X480 standard. Reminds me of the P&S; cameras prior 2005.Considering the small CCD it has its not best in lowlight at all. Picture quality is okay, and usable still not on par with my old Canon A310 from 2004. Physical camera shutter  button on the phone doesn't respond very well if wanting to take multiple photos. So the onscreen shutter button is best be used in that regard. Lacks a timer and flash. So essentially good enough only in well-lit conditions, but not with fast moving subjects. Video quality is the same with picture quality. Definitely not replacing my P&S; camera at all.Overall its a decent low-end handset for me as a texted.Didn't touch on every single detail, but eh  likely prior reviewers already done so.I do recommend getting a battery extender for this phone especially the fat variety that comes with a backplate for it. More battery life and a better grip atleast that is for me.March 2014 Update:Phone still functions flawlessly.

B0060NG6M2,A1M4M0O5JBIXW7,NY Andrew,"[0, 1]","Well, first off, this is my FIRST smartphone! YAY ME! Anyway, with the Virgin Mobile plan of $35 a month, you can't go wrong. You will get everything an iPhone user gets for almost a third of the price!!! Me being a college student, this is what I need and can afford.OK, so this phone is AMAZING!!! I LOVE IT!!! Alright, the battery will most likely be bad (I never tried it), but install an Extended Battery for it like I did (READ MY REVIEW ON IT FOR MORE INFO!!!).Anyway, the slide out keyboard is awesome and useful when typing for accuracy. Speaking of typing, I DO NOT like the swype keyboard, but it is optional so don't worry. Now the slide out keyboard does have one big downside..The stupid back button is next to the A button.. So if you slip and click the back button, you will lose your typed message.. Also the spacebar on the slide out keyboard is complete TRASH. You literally have to push directly in the center in order for it to pick up the keypress, you can't just press the edge of the spacebar.. Whatever, it's still faster then the touchscreen when aiming for accuracy.Now, the phone does not have that much internal memory. Now you're thinking to yourself, ""It comes with an SD card, I don't need internal memory."" WRONG! The stock apps suck up a lot more memory then you would think... Yes you can move some apps you download to the SD card, but most won't let you. So you won't be able to install a HUGE amount of apps. Plus remember that it will ask you to update apps (you can ignore it though) and that will use more internal memory for internal apps. Supposedly, you can ROOT and delete these stock apps, etc, but I'm not down for the risks and plus I haven't found a reliable up-to-date guide.As for the phone itself, I LOVE IT SO MUCH! I moved from a Pantech AT&T; Prepaid GoPhone to this phone and it is the best choice I've made in a long time! I have come across a couple Wi-Fi glitches, but maybe that's because I don't live in a cell service area..All in all, I recommend this phone to anyone wanting a GREAT smartphone with a top-line Operating System with a CHEAP monthly plan!

The Optimus Slider is worlds faster and more reliable than my previous Virgin Mobile phone the Samsung Intercept but it still has some problems. It occasionally shuts down and the only way to restart is to remove the battery. Also, sometimes it will get really hot and blow through all your battery power in about an hour as if every app on the phone is running at once. To alleviate this problem I highly recommend the Advanced Task Killer by ReChild. Installing this app appears to have fixed that problem but I have to be dilligent about killing apps. Other than these two issues I've been happy with this phone especially coming from using one of the worst smartphones ever, the Intercept. However, if it breaks I probably won't buy it again. I'll be tempted to try out something else. Overall though I don't regret purchasing this phone and it was worth the low $180 price.

B006E8MKZU,AYYF9H1WKICH7,A. Fierman,"[15, 16]","I have had the LG800G Tracfone for about four months and have differing thoughts.  It is a good deal for a touch screen.  When it first came out, the price point was at $59.99.  Now (July 2012) it is at $49.99.  When I got mine through the Tracfone website, it was at $39.99.  Amazon is offering it for $32.99, which is a good deal.  The phone is easy to use and for a prepaid phone is a giant leap for the technology available.  Everything about the phone is fantastic except for texting.  There is no stylus provided with the phone and texting with your fingers is difficult.  There are different methods of texting input.  You can use the ABC method like the older analaog phones were.  You can use the QWERTY keyboard, which is difficult to do unless you use a pencil or other ""stylus"".  You can use the hand writing method.  I have been told that I print like a walking typewriter (Thanks to Mrs Foster my fourth grade teacher).  Even with this, I have to attempt up to five times to get a ""T"" not to register as a ""J"".  Be careful also about how you carry the phone when not in use.  The touch screen is very sensative and could engage when you don't want it to.  It is also annoying when getting a call.  As soon as you get the call, the screen goes into the lock mode and you have to hold the unlock icon if you need to press any keys for input, (Like when the prompt comes for you to enter 1 for this or enter 2 for that).  I do like the phone for daily use.  I just can't text with it.  Tracfones are relatively inexpensive so I have a second one that I use for texting.  My friends and family have gotten used to me having more than the one phone number.  Is it a Smart Phone?  It could be with the right apps.  Tracfone is pretty ""propriotary"" with their software and can only be downloaded through their sites so you are very limited on what you can do.  I am retired now and do not use my phone as I used to but like to have an upgrade from the ""clamshell"" type of phones.  If you can use a phone with touchscreen but again do not use the phone as your PC, this one is good.  If you use your phone for texting, this one could really slow you down.  Make sure you know what you are getting into when you get this one.  I might just retire this one into one of my desk drawers and go back to my LG500C.

B006E8MKZU,A12DQZKRKTNF5E,Andrea Polk,"[2, 2]","I purchased this phone for my husband who has been using a Motorola flip phone (Tracfone) for the past five years. The older phone was still working fine, but I needed a gift idea for Father's Day so I thought I'd 'upgrade' him to a touchscreen phone and the purchase of some extras for the phone was a good idea. I had looked at the more expensive Tracfone offerings:LG 840G Prepaid Phone With Triple Minutes (Tracfone)andLG Optimus Dynamic Android Prepaid Phone with Triple Minutes (Tracfone), but he's a cheap guy who doesn't text and makes about 2 short calls a month, so I thought this LG 800G would be a good choice.The flip phone also had triple minutes, so I was looking for that perk on this one. For those who have not experienced this before, you can add aTracfone 60 Minute Airtime Cardand get 180 minutes automatically with triple minute phones. This works with any size of additional minutes added - the minutes are tripled when added to this phone.ACTIVATION:Upon opening the sealed container we found the LG 800G, a wall charger, booklet and activation code (red card). After charging the phone; which took no time at all, I went to Tracfone dot com to port the flip phone's number to the new phone. **You CAN keep your old number when getting a new Tracfone.  If it sounds difficult call Tracfone and they'll walk you through it.I transferred the number by entering in the old phone number and the old phone and new phone's serial numbers - found in the PrePaid section of each phone. Tracfone indicated this process could take a couple hours, but up to 4 days in some cases. My deactivation of the old phone took about 1 hour, then I noted the phone number had been changed to the new phone, but the minutes had not transferred and neither phone was activated or could be used. Approximately 8 hours later, the new phone was activated by Tracfone, but it was missing minutes that should have been transferred.NOTE: Another great feature of Tracfone service is that the minutes rollover each month - you don't lose them! We had 1500 minutes on the old phone and only 1100 transferred.PROBLEM TRANSFERRING ALL THE MINUTES:I called Tracfone and after several 'hit this button to's', I got a real person, who was a tad hard for me to understand. Despite the language barrier, we did manage to get the lost 400 minutes transferred quickly and easily (while I was on the phone with the rep).I was happy and surprised to find out that the service activation is good for 1 year - not the expected 90 days before there is a need to add more minutes. For my husband, this means that he'll have a phone for free for 1 year, as he will never use 1500 minutes in 12 months.THE PHONE:I purchased a case, charging accessories, and screen protectors for under fifteen bucks on Amazon, and thus for twenty-five I have a fully functional, semi-smartphone with touchscreen input.  The 3x minutes and 1 year of service without a need to add minutes make this a super-sweet deal at under ten dollars.The phone itself is lightweight in its construction, and the touchscreen response is lacking by comparison to new, higher end phones, but hey, you're getting a lot for the price!The touchscreen requires calibration - you can do it in Settings on the phone, and when using the touchscreen you actually have to press versus just touching it lightly. Time will tell if that negatively affects performance of the phone.Web surfing on this phone can be done, but it's expensive and awkward. You can text with the phone (about thirty cents per text) , but it's not a phone that's the best for texting. It has a Qwerty touchscreen keyboard, as well as a number pad that can be used for data entry.There is no GPS on the phone, but you do have apps for email and other functions. You can buy games with your minutes, check the weather, input info into a calendar app, and use the phone as a MP3 player. (It has a 3.5mm headphone jack on the top of it, and a microSD slot on the side that will accept up to a 4GB card - available for about six dollars shipped.)Because it has Bluetooth, you can pair it with a hands-free headset or your car's Bluetooth. You can also pair it with a portable  Bluetooth speaker to enjoy your music from the phone - anywhere!There is a 2MP camera and you can take video with this phone. Obviously this is not the phone's strong-suit, but it does work and media can be saved to the internal memory or a microSD card (considered 'external' memory). You can also transfer photos from your old phone to the new phone with a cable transfer, or by transferring a microSD card between the two; putting photos from the old phone on the card and then putting the card into the new phone.The screen can be set as shown on Amazon, or to a darker, more attractive screen. You can use your photos as wallpaper on this phone.Call quality where I live is excellent. Sprint towers are used, and this phone can actually make and receive calls better than my Virgin Mobile powered iPhone 4S.My husband likes his new phone, but he says there is a learning curve for him. Thankfully there are also quite a few video tutorials on YouTube that are very helpful for figuring out the basic functionality of this phone.PROS:1. Inexpensive phone.2. 1 Year Service with Activation; instead of the usual 90 days, with additional service time added with more airtime added to the phone, which can be added at any time. (It means you don't have to worry about your phone being deactivated after 90 days if you haven't added additional minutes to keep it active.)3. You can text, call, take video, take photos, play games, surf the web, listen to music, and more!4. Easy to use; the icons make things clear.5. Triple Minute phone for the life of the phone.6. Bluetooth for connecting to hands free speakers and headsets.CONS:1. Feels cheap; lightweight construction, by comparison to higher end touchscreen phones.2. Touchscreen has to be depressed versus just touched, to operate.3. Using the Internet is expensive, and there is NO WIFI option to surf without using data.4. NO GPS or navigation options, other than to use the browser to use Google Maps or similar.TIP: If you want to check your Voicemail, call your phone via another phone, and when your Voicemail picks up, press * on the phone you are calling from and enter your passcode when prompted. This doesn't use your Tracfone's minutes when you're checking your Voicemail.Overall, this is a great buy when you consider you'll pay as much for two tall lattes. The price is what makes me give it 5 stars. My husband is happy with it, and I'm happy I was able to transfer minutes, and get a phone with a 1 year activation and triple minutes.I also purchased these accessories for the phone:3x LG 800G Premium Clear LCD Screen Protector Cover Guard Shield Protective Film Kit,Hard Case for LG 800G BLACK - SLCPC06-LG800GBKandLG 800G Combo Rapid Car Charger + Home Wall Charger + USB Data Charge Sync Cable for LG 800G.6/18/14: Successfully added a 4GB microSD card into this phone.

For me it's as my second phone as I also have a hard line, I use this phone when out and about. It does take good pictures but the screen is a bit too small to use for the internet option, though it can be done. I suggest that you get the extra storage chip and cord so you can connect it to your Pc and a screen protector (3 to a pack) to keep it from being scratched, all these can be purchased together group for a few $ here on Amazon and less than on ebay..This is the second TracFone I have had the other was an old Motorola flip phone so after 2+ year of use the battery went bad so rather than buying another battery I sprang for a new phone (my kids told me I had been working with vintage technology) I am extremely satified with this phone.  There are features which I haven't explored yet----BUT THE PRICE IS RIGHT and NO CONTRACT, buy only the airtime you need. With this phone came triple minutes for the life of the PHONE which means when you buy 100 minutes what actually receive is 300 minutes of air time, I buy minutes a year at a time. It also works with the bluetooth feature in my car--hands free thru the radio. There is also other special aps like ITunes which you can purchase if you think you need them in exchange for your air time minutes as these minutes have a dollar value...PS- the phone still works even after my dog chewed the cornor off of it.

If you get the maximum minutes bundle with the triple minutes plan, it's still like 10-11 cents a min. Buy the smallest bundle and it's more like 33 cents a min. So at best you pay $6/hr to gab?! At worst, $19.80/hour! Remember the stores charge tax on these cards as do the company when you refill from them.Signal was great in rural Ohio, clear, best I have had of 8 phones.

We've always  owned cheap pay as you go phones, because the value is fantastic and we hate getting ourselves into pricey contracts.  This phone is smart in looks only.  The features are awful, the touch screen finicky...it's basically a toy phone meant to ""look"" like a fancier one.  My husband has had his for about 6 months and it just kept getting worse.  We just replaced it with a $65 Optimus Elite and what a world of difference.  Seriously...unless you're getting this for a child, never use your phone, and rarely text I cannot recommend it.  If you have never ever owned any other touch screen device, you might think this is pretty nifty. We have always gone with low end pay as you go's, but we would have preferred one of the non touch screen ones over this.  The pros are that it is super cheap (especially on amazon) and tracfone is fairly reliable and a very inexpensive service.  The cons are that the phone is just doesn't work well after a couple of months, and the touch screen on my 5 year old daughters leapfrog toys are better made and less finicky.

B006E8MKZU,A1VYFEJM12ZP11,Jana Taylor,"[7, 7]","My family has used Tracfone for years and this is the 7th phone we've bought.  This was a replacement for my old phone which after 5 years finally died.  This was my FIRST Tracfone bought somewhere other than the Tracfone website and I will probably be doing this in this in the future as it seems to be the cheaper option.I was able to transfer my old phone number and minutes with ease through the website and the process was pretty painless.The phone itself is the nicest one by far we've ever gotten.  Camera, MP3 player, games, web access, memo pad, calendar, alarms, touch screen... it seems to have everything I'd need and mostly stuff I'll probably never use but I'm still annoyed that it touts having the MP3 player but you have to buy the SD card and cord separately for it to be of use.  I have purchased those but they have not yet arrived so I can't say if that feature is any good or not.The thing I like best about this phone was that adding contacts was so much easier with the ""handwriting"" option rather than using the keypad.  I could use my finger and I got some measure of accuracy but using a toothpick I was able to just write in all my contact names and numbers in no time at all.  It was just awesome.  I imagine there has got to be a stylus somewhere for sale for this phone you can buy separately.  I'll probably stick to my toothpick which is free and handy.The phone menu is a vastly different set up than anything I had previously but it didn't take too long to get used to and now I feel pretty comfortable with it.  Tracfones are always very simple to use, and that is somewhat appealing to me, I don't have to spend hours to familiarize myself with them.  They get the job done efficiently and cheaply.  This phone though looks more complicated than it is.  Fool your friends into thinking you have an expensive cell plan!  Then laugh as you have loads more money at the end of the month!EDIT - I have since began using the MP3 feature and I love it.  It works so well and I have since stopped using my old MP3 player even though the sound quality on it was better.  This is just so much more convenient because it is also my phone.I have also figured out how to disable the ""lock screen"" that comes up automatically on the phone.  That was so annoying to me.  So now my phone is just the way I like it.EDIT - I have also discovered you can convert your videos to GP3 format and load them on this phone and play videos.  This is a lifesaver for me because I don't like my &lt;2 year old son to play with my more expensive Sony media player or my Galaxy Tablets, so I can just give him my inexpensive phone and load a video and he's happy.  I am seriously considering just buying another phone just for him for the purposes of a cheap video player only...

Although it is the only touch-type phone that TracPhone  offers I believe that it needs a great deal more R and D.

(4 hr talk, and 8 day standby) It has to be discharged fully and recharged a couple time and should be OK. Sending photos deducts 1 full minute.

I wanted a phone that could access the internet and one that would support some apps but I didn't want a contract and pay $50 - $100 a month and I didn't want to pay hundreds of dollars for a phone either. This phone is perfect for me. I can access the internet and check my email, do some surfing and even Ebay. You can Bookmark the mobile versions of many websites. I also downloaded the Opera Mini browser for free and it works great. For under $40 dollars, you get more then your money's worth. With internet access, texting (it even has hand writing recognition), camera, music and of course voice calls, you can't go wrong with this phone. Internet connection speed has been good for me too. Although at times it hangs,  most of the time it's a good connection. And you can add more storage by getting a SDHC Flash Memory Card. Calls are very clear too. This is a full feature phone. It may not be an android but there are many free Java apps out there. I downloaded for free, a ton of ringtones, wallpapers and games and installed Google Maps, which works great. I also downloaded a mobile spreadsheet app. And I synced my Bluetooth headset. File transfer between PC and phone is a breeze. Just be sure to get the USB cable. I'm more then pleased with this phone and I'm still discovering all that it can do. I would recommend it to anybody who would like a smart phone but doesn't want to spend the money. Also, with this phone you get triple minutes for life, which is a great deal. I average about $10 a month on mine, so I feel that I have a great deal and get a lot for that 10 bucks.

Plus the batteries are not soldered in like some phones requiring you to send your phone away and pay someone else to replace it. It also has a memory slot inside, unlike others, to add more memory options to your phone. It includes many features. Some of my favorites: I can either buy games directly off phone or buy a cheap memory card and load it with java games & apps off the internet or my PC; Customizable Menus; Texting/E-mailing to phones or computer users; I can insert my stand-alone camera's vacation photos into it and show them anywhere. If someone wants a copy, I can just send it as an attachment to their cell phone# or e-mail address.  Besides the deeply discounted and dependable cell service, my favorite feature is the MP3 player and Music Software Suite. Not only can the phone display an album Cover (if included in song file) it has a graphic equalizer to adjust Bass, Treble Etc. It scrolls at the touch of a finger to find the right song or you can use the advanced search option to find a specific tune. You can even slide the song (or video) to any position with your finger. You can adjust the volume with a touch-slide or press side buttons on phone. The headphone port accepts all standard mini-phono jacks so you do not need to special order them.It's appearance is streamlined & quite similar to many trending phones and more so if a 'skin' is used; it does not scream 'Prepaid'. There are many hits and some misses but for the price you can not go wrong. The Phone is customizable; I can buy various skins, guards, protective screen films, tripods, headphones, chargers etc. from different brands, buy or load different wallpapers & ringtones from my PC and I can load all of my favorite music on a memory card and use it just as an iPod but for 90% less. Even if I no longer keep it activated it can be used or shared & recycled as a stand alone LQ Video Camera, MP3 Player, Picture Camera, Calculator, Tip Formulator, Digital Photo Scrapbook Screen, Night-Time Key-Hole Finder, Phone Book, Mini-Game Console, & Voice Recorder.Some people insult these phones merely for NOT being a Premiere model but a premium price is not being paid, so don't expect it!?Top notch Phones & Plans combined can cost hundred$ or thou$ands a year and require a two year Legal Financial Contract and a credit check! If you are an infrequent user and don't need to be a trend-copier but still want a Dependable, Durable, Economical yet Multi-Functional Phone with _Some_ options, this Trac-Fone Model is for you. [I suggest the yearly card for the very best rates- first year average about 35c a day (127yr) and includes over 20 hours of talk time using the triple minutes 27c 2nd year]*  Note: Is not compatible with the majority of Apps & Services advertised towards the costly models.**  Initial setup may require patience & time from customer service but it appears most phones areset-up instantly -> to three days max.

Then it's a snap to cut and paste or copy/paste from one drive to another.If you are new to the LG800g, Google tutorials for an impressive list of tasks.

I also got lifetime triple minutes.  All for $37!!!  It cost me $4 from Amazon.com to get the 4gb micro card.  I had bought the 8gb micro card it said it would take and nothing would make it work.  I called Tracfone and learned it will ONLY take 4gb. Now it works perfectly.  One must go into photo camera and page 2 to activate/change over to the additional memory card.  SIMPLE.  As a phone it is excellent.  People can actually hear me.  I can hear them.  The camera is great 2mb will store like 1100 pictures on the extra card or alot of music.  There are crazy features like internet access I rarely use for other than weather and international calling and texting is crazy cheap.  In SHORT I love this phone.

If you need to buy minutes or basic needs on their web page you will be OK, BUT if you need to talk to someone for help you may be in for a real experience. My wife and I have had Net10 phones for five years and have been happy. I decided to purchase a new phone for my wife that would be easier to text from so I purchased the LG-800G. It came in two days and looks like it would do a nice job for us. My wife does not use her phone much so her minutes pile up. I use my phone much more so I don't have many minutes but lots of service days.I called and spoke to a Net10 Service Rep. and asked if they could transfer the 2200 minutes from My wife's phone to my phone. The Rep. said ""Sure"". She had me enter data on my wife's phone to take the minutes off her phone and move them to my phone. Well, she got the minutes off of her phone but they never showed up on my phone. I have been on the phone for several hours the past three days with no success. I have been given Ticket Numbers for special help. These have no meaning as the next person I talk to has no idea why I am calling and I have to explain why I am calling each time. The reps. spend most of your time updating their logging system and not providing any meaningful help to the customer.My last call was to a specialist who spent his time updating his records and then told me he was replacing my phone and I would have to return my phone which is out of warranty. He had no idea if that would fix my problem. At that point, I had had enough and told him to keep the phone and I would look for a new carrier.

B006E8MKZU,AE826WHLH1ZQJ,x,"[4, 5]","I recently bought this LG 800G ""smart"" phone to replace another LG (500) with the teeny-tiny keypad for texting.  Using that phone was a nightmare, seeing how my one finger would routinely push down 2-3 keys at the same time.  Using the new LG 800G is such a nice upgrade from that mini keyboard- love that handwriting recognition feature!  The LG 800 has a great sounding MP3 player (with equalizer and CD cover art), a really good quality camera with instagram-esque filters you can add to your photos, and a very handy touch screen that makes it extremely user friendly.I initially had a problem switching phones - the phone number tranfered okay, but the minutes I had on my old phone (1988) showed up as 0 on my new phone.  I kept getting the ""activation required"" message as well.  After calling Tracfone 2 times, they had my new LG 800G up and running - and as you can guess, I love it!  If you're looking for a cheap upgrade from a basic Tracfone, this is the one to get.  No- it isn't an iPhone or even one of the many Samsung droid smart phones, but for $30 and $100 for 400 minutes per year (did I mention this phone has 3x minutes!) it'll leave your hard earned dollars in your wallet to be spent on other more important things.  Do iPhone users really spend $600+ a year for data plans + $200 for the phone?

First, the app that they have designed to work with this bluetooth won't work unless you have media and audio options being used with your phone which means that if you are using the A2DP part of the bluetooth with a second device, you cannot hear text messages through your bluetooth. This works with other talk-to-text apps. Secondly, I left my iPod connected to my bluetooth in my house on the first floor and I stepped outside to get something from my car approximately 10 feet away and the music started stuttering and cut out all together at one point. Not good AT ALL! Lastly, the earpiece on the bluetooth IS uncomfortable; but, just as another customer recommended, buying some smaller and more comfortable earbuds REALLY did the trick. I bought another bluetooth to replace this one, hopefully, so I'll probably return it. Another thing, a question I had before I purchased this bluetooth was ""Can it connect to two devices at one time?"" The answer is absolutely. I have it connected to my phone and my iPod touch as I type. Sound quality is excellent. People I talked to did not know I was on a bluetooth.  One more thing I forgot about that I REALLY didn't like.  Usually my bluetooth headsets that connect to two devices will pause my music while I take a call then resume my music after the call has ended.  My music just kept playing through the call which means I will need to physically stop my music from playing while I'm on the phone.

Battery life is extremely long....I haven't charged it yet. Talk time is great, haven't run out of battery when using it. The text to speech works fantastic. With a tap on the front you pick up your calls. Use two taps and it will dial the last number you spoke with. When turning on it automatically tells you the battery life &#34;Connected...x amount of battery remaining.&#34;Talk range is easily 30 feet or so, I went out onto my front porch and had an hour and a half conversation before I realized that I had left my cell in the house! Noise reduction is great, I haven't had any complaints from callers. My husband also has one and I can not tell if he is on a blue tooth or straight cell. There is no echo and the call is crisp.The only reason that I give it 4 stars is that it fits rather large in my ear and does hurt. I have to remove it constantly and never can forget that I have it on. I called LG and asked if there is a smaller ear-bud that I could order, unfortunately, there isn't one.

The battery life is phenomenal, and the range is plenty. Pairing with devices is extremely easy and fast.So far I've paired it with the following devices:Samsung Galaxy S3 AT&T; (i747 running CM10 M2): : Calls, music, audio all work through the headset and the headset buttons all work with the phone too. The S3 also supports AptX so this pairing was meant to be!PS3: : The HBS-730 only works as a voice and mic headset with the PS3. So no in-game sound will go through to the headset. Bummer, I know...PS Vita: : I was not expecting this, but all the audio from the Vita is outputted to the headset! In game sound, voice chat, music, everything! I couldn't believe it. I thought it would just be voice chat just like the PS3, but I was pleasantly mistaken!Nexus 7: : Works just like the phone, except for the phone part haha.Desktop using Asus USB Bluetooth Adapter ([...]): : All the sound is outputted through to the headset clearly. Although, when watching a movie, for example, there is a very very small lag between the video and audio which is expected from a wireless set, but it's not enough to affect the viewing experience.Overall, get this headset. Just get it an be happy with wireless freedom. The battery lasts longer than expected, it's form factor/weight makes me forget it's even on my neck, and the sound quality is exceptional!Tip: make sure your Bluetooth device supports A2DP & AVRCP to get the full functionality from the LG Tone+. At least make sure it has A2DP, which enables stereo audio to be transmitted. AVRCP is for the button controls, which is obviously not necessary but very awesome indeed. Most Bluetooth devices will have these profiles, but just make sure. (Likely, BT 2.0 and up)As always, I will update this review if anything comes up.

I purchased the 700 3 weeks ago and used it extensively. I love the 700. The sound is not stellar, but it isn't totally crappy. The sound lacks depth, like the difference between AM sound and FM sound, though not as extreme. The sound also distorts on the loud end. However, it worked great.The 730 has a few extra features that make it better, like the voice battery status and other messages. The sound is much better. The sound quality now rivals mid-tier phones that would please the average user who likes bass and mostly clear sound. It's full sound, but not audiophile quality. I am no audiophile and do have mild-medium hearing loss. I hate total flat response, anyway, even if it is ""pure."" I like good clean sound with a little extra nice, tight bass. Compared to my Bose QC15s, this is not too far off. I'd say this is pretty darn good for BT headphones. This would be worth the upgrade hands down if not for one big flaw.The range of this is far inferior to the 700 I own. It drops out sound and makes it choppy after 10 feet. With the 700, I can be 2 stories down, 20 feet away, and choppiness is minimal. Not so with 730. Just turning my back to my phone from 10 feet away and sound drops. Knowing the battery life is a little better on the 730s, it makes me wonder if LG didn't simply reduce the BT radio power for more efficiency? I hope not. I was perfectly fine with the battery life of the 700s. That's just speculation, but the radio performance between the two headsets is huge.What I love about BT headsets is the freedom I have to leave my phone down and do things. With the 700, I had this freedom with OK, but nothing special sound. With the 730, I have great sound with good bass, but can't go more than 5-10 feet without having annoying drops in sound.Which one to send back?***Update 9 OCT 2012***I really love the sound improvement over the 700. I find I am using the 730 all the time and have modified my behavior in order to prevent the dropped sound. One thing to note is that these in ear phones are comfortable, but are so because they don't jam all they way in the ear. There is a little more air that gets in. In the office or at home, no issue, sound and bass is great. While driving in the car, I lose a lot of bass and have to turn it up more and stuff them tighter in the ear. It is still a clearer, more open sound.Based on the few comments left, I will be calling LG to see if my unit is defective.I also want to note that the color difference where the buds attach is much better. The silver color is less obnoxious. I tend to be more conservative in dress and don't like loud colors that scream, ""look at me.""I do wish the wires were a more flexible as the stiffness causes them to stick out. Thankfully, the wires are very thin and most people won't notice them from a distance.I also wish the magnets were a little stronger. It's easy to knock them out of the holder area.In spite of these other little points, I still think this is the best BT headset I've ever had. The biggest advantage is that they are ""there."" With my past headsets, once they are out of the ear, I kept losing them all the time. Not so with these. It's also way better for listening to music, way better. I also like that when it's loud, I can put both buds in and actually hear the conversation I am having.***Update NOV 27 2012***I ended up keeping both. I'm using the 730 less and just starting going back to the 700 because of the better range. The big reason for this is because the 730 began dropping out in the middle of a longer phone conversation. This was getting very annoying, especially with my 35 minute each way drive to and from work. I'd have to scramble to turn on the speakerphone. All it took was a shut off and turn back on to make it connect, but this is not good. It does this even being fully charged. I wanted to send back the 730, but with my busy schedule, I unfortunately missed the deadline.With the latest problem, I can't recommend these. Short range for music is one thing - it won't matter in certain situations. Drops during calls is a deal killer for me.I am also finding the magnets to be more of an issue, though more a minor annoyance. I tuck everything in under my collar and fish out the ear buds by pulling on the wire. I'd rather just go to where it is supposed to be seated. This is true of both 700 and 730.***UPDATE 19 FEB 2013***After several more months of use, I almost exclusively use the 700s while the 730 sits collecting dust. Why? The only major advantage the 730s has, with its range issue, is the sound quality. So, if it's just going to be headphones, I'd rather use good headphones. That's what I've done - first with the V-Moda M-100 (which include a mic, a great portable headphone with really good sound) and now the HiFiman HE-500, which gives me awesome premium sound, though no mic and not really portable.I still use the 700's paired to my phone because it is more reliable. Still, it does drop on me, an issue I'm going to blame on my phone, as it has other quirks that lead me to believe that.After reading some comments below, those who were in the same boat as me, until LG offers a fix, or a better model, go with the 700s. If sound is really important to you and you are just going to sit in an office, buy yourself a nice in ear buds or headphones with great sound quality and a built in mic. There are a lot of choices that way.***UPDATE 6 NOV 2013***For those of you who are having issues with the tips, I have found a happy solution. I got the Comply T-400 foam tips and they greatly increase the noise isolation as well as staying in the ear better with activity. The set comes with three sizes and I use all of them with various earphones. They are pretty tight going on, but can be wiggled on with a little muscle.Comply T-400 Isolation Earphone Tips (Black, 3 Pairs, S/M/L)Comply offers white and sets with one size.***UPDATE 20 DEC 2013***I finally retired the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. I now have the Verizon LG G2. I did not choose the phone with BT headsets in mind at all. I mainly choose if for the battery life and Snapdragon 800/Adreno 330 combination. The LG G2 phone does have BT 4.0.I wasn't looking for it, but I dug up the HBS-730, which has been missing for some time, but not missed. I charged it up and gave it a try with the LG G2. Holy smokes! The connection problems are greatly reduced! In fact, I'd say the range is about 85%-90% of the the HBS-700s, which is about twice the range I got with the Galaxy Nexus. The choppiness does not start until I get a respectable distance away, even through a wall. I can put my phone in my back pocket without it cutting out. The range is good enough that I now have some freedom to move about.With the range issues minimized, it's like I just got a new device and am giddy and happy! I can now enjoy the feature improvements that lured me to the 730s in the first place, to include the vastly superior sound quality, and being able to connect to 2 devices (need to power off, hold call button while powering back on to pair to second device) which I really appreciate since I use the Cowan Z2 for my music and audio books. I'm loving that I can go wireless with both devices, and know I can still get my calls while listening to the Cowan.The HBS-730 just took on a whole new life and I can't wait to start using it again!Based on my own experience and from the posts from other users, the HBS-730s seem to be device specific for the best experience. Maybe it's because LG specifically made sure the G2 works well with the 730, but I'm glad that it does, as I love the G2 phone (other than Verizon messing up the buttons on the back.)I will continue to use the 730s for a bit longer and if it holds up, I will change the rating.Thank you all for the great discussion down below!",3.0,1349481600,"10 6, 2012",LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,48.23,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rkWJ3jIBL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

To give some background perspective, I have had jaybirds (stopped working after only 9 months..thankfully had warranty  at Best Buy and got my money back as they are somewhat pricey)..Sony wireless clip with FM radio (they were ok but easily misplaced/came loose as wearing them required they beclipped to clothing and finally I ended up losing them), cheapie/knock off ear tags I purchased off Amazon that have really crappy sound, microphone and battery life.I was looking for comfortable, great sounding headphones fornmy daily commute.  These fit the bill.  The battery life is good so far.  Pairing was unbelievably simple..turned them on...turned on scan on my phone (Note II) and they were paired. Call quality is good..no complaints from callers or inability to converse.  The bluetooth signal isnt easily blocked as was the case with my old jaybirds and the crappy ear tags.  The only disadvantages are 1. These are too bulky for exercise.  They seem too susceptible to getting shorted from sweat as they rest around your neck. 2. Wish they came with a case..I am going to have to find something to put them in so they dont get damaged in my bag or purse.  I will likely keep using the crappy tags to exercise as their limited battery life and sound quality are acceptable trade-offs given their portability and better suited design.  But that is all they are good for...these are now my daily go-to headphones for excellent sound and comfort.",5.0,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,48.23,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rkWJ3jIBL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

Beautiful!At first, just when I received the headphones, I was concerned by the quality of the sound: not great with a lot of echo. But after charging the headphones: WOW!!! Amazing sound!!! Bluetooth works great too with my phone (Samsung Note 2 with an Otterbox Commuter case). At least 35 feet on the same floor and even through one closed door, at a different floor and at a distance of 30 feet. I wonder whether people reporting losing the signal have either a phone with a bad bluetooth 'antenna' or maybe an Otterbox defender case or any kind of casing that would mask the bluetooth signal. Or maybe their HBS730 has a defective battery that could explain their bad connection with the phone. In any case, if I have anything bad about these bluetooth headphones or the LG customer service, I will update my review.But so far, highly recommended!!!Update: After 2 weeks of using it: no complain at all. Sound still great. No problem to answer a phone call. The microphone is very sensitive. No interruption in my listening even when walking and with my phone in my back pocket.

B009A5204K,A19PH5EX0Q2ATV,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","I looked through a lot of reviews before I settled on the LG Tone+ HBS-730. Either the ear buds were way out of my price range or they seemed to be unreliable. Everyone raved about the original Tone Bluetooth headset, but said it sounded tinny. This set caught my eye because a lot of reviewers said they sounded better than the originals. However, there were a lot of complaints about these headphones dropping connection with the device in a front pocket or only a foot or so away. Other people said they had no problems. It was one reviewer who mentioned that it could be an issue with an older protocol on older phones. Because of his review I decided to take a chance and get them, if I didn't like them I could send them back. (I have an LG Nexus 4 phone.)These arrived, a birthday present I picked out, and I synced them to my phone. They synced effortlessly. I simply turned them on and pressed the button on top that flashed blue. Went into my settings and turned on the Bluetooth and had it search for new devices. It found the headphones, I tapped, they paired, done. I turned on some music, sounded great. I would say it has plenty of base and a nice range. I use the poweramp app, so I was able to tune them the way I like my music to sound. Would I say they would compete with 300.00 headphones, no. But they sound really good for the price. I made a couple of phone calls, clarity was great. Everyone I called said it sounded like I was just talking normal on my phone. The only issue I had was a brother who talked to me over a speaker phone, it sounded echoey, but that was on his end. Everyone else sounded great. I fiddled with the settings and volume, everything works great. As to connectivity, on my Nexus 4, I put my phone in my pants pocket and did my normal tasks, sound never lost quality or dropped. Put it in my back pocket, same result. Decided that evening to check how far away I could get before it would dropp. I left my phone on its charger and walked out of my bedroom on one side of the house to my living room on the other side, the sound quality dropped a little when I got to the far end of the living room, as soon as I stopped the sound quality returned to normal and I finished listening to the song. I then walked downstairs to my basement all the way to the other side and the sound quality cut out for a split second and recovered as soon as I stopped walking. I sat at my computer and listened to music for almost an hour with only a few momentarily noticeable drops in quality and or sound. I figured that was a good enough test for me. I would say that the connectivity equals that of the older model as described in many reviews. So why do some of us rave about these headphones and others curse them? I can only assume that the reviewer who mentioned needing a newer phone with an upgraded protocol was right. With my Nexus phone, they are stellar. Only time will if they are durable. My only negative impression is the necleas doo-hickies on my neck. But I knew that going in.

Here's the summary (after a week):  First, the sound quality sucks.  Really.  Phone calls sound very, very tinny.  Music sounds flat and unimpressive.  The equalizing function doesn't work, perhaps becasue it is hooked to an iPhone (they mention it won't work if you have &#34;apt-X&#34; on your device, and I have no idea if iPhone does).

B009A5204K,A3A2RA03DTGOSU,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Work fabulously well. Pros: The ear bud fit is excellent.  I have small canals, so this is often an issue for me. Once paired, connecting is nearly instantaneous.  Sound quality is clear and balanced with good bass. Audiophiles need not be overly concerned, but don't be foolish:  It's not an over the ear Bose system, so don't expect it to be.  Controls are simple to learn, and there are very few 'combination' controls, which I love.  Separate controls for all the important functions, unlike the Plantronics model that has recently been released (which I personally despised.)  As long as these are made, I will buy another.  No issues with the buttons, wires, other hardware.Cons: When firmly seated in the ear, phone calls can be painful even with the Bluetooth level turned to the minimum on Samsung phones.  Often I have to loosen the buds to escape the clear, and sometimes painful sound levels.  The Android limitation is the number of available increments you can adjust the volume down.  There are apps in the market that allow for much lower volume.  It's been nearly two years since I purchased these, and they randomly disconnect, or I experience one way audio.  I must unpair and re-pair to alleviate the condition.  Not an issue with a task cleaner (as I don't use them).Summary: The sound with music is excellent, though with occasional (and consistent) pause for buffering (again, this may be an Android issue).  Just wish the performance remained consistent.  I.e.: Connection and sound quality.

There are three different sizes and you can easily buy replacement earpieces on Amazon. The only problem is the head phones were corded - and I ruined the cord when I was doing heavy yard work.So I tried these headphones. Since it is bluetooth, there isn't a cord. Also, sometimes I have to wear earmuffs when operating loud equipment, so that is a concern. Well, it works just fine with this headset. The cords from the necklace aren't very long and it is not an issue at all when I use this with earmuffs.The bluetooth works well, though I have had some issues. I use this with my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 phone, to listen to audio books and podcasts. If I have the phone in my pocket and turn my head or body to the left, sometimes the signal cuts out a bit. If I have a shirt with a big enough pocket, I can put the phone in the front pocket and I do not have the same issue. But really? From my pants pocket to my neck isn't that far!I have another set of bluetooth headphones that cover the ear, and I have never had problems like that. Also, if I walk away from the phone, I can go about 10 feet and then the signal starts dropping.LG needs to work on the bluetooth issue, even though apparently LG denies it is a problem, but it is a problem for those who need to walk around a room without a phone in their pocket or want to connect to a computer, for example.It does seem to work fairly well with talking on the phone, but it's real sensitive to wind noise. So don't talk on the phone outside!I tried streaming music with it the other day, and I must say, it sounded really good! Listened to some Beatles - I Am the Walrus, Revolver, Jimi Hendrix, Moody Blues, Buck Owens, Mozart, sounded real nice, I was very pleasantly surprised.I am not real wild about the earpieces - they are the kind you actually insert in the ear. After awhile it starts to bother me, and I have to take them out and put them back in again. Also, wind does make a noise with these headphones, even when just listening to music or audiobooks and not talking on the phone. It's the design of the earpiece.Overall, I am very happy with this purchase because it allows me to do yard work and other outdoor activities while listening to books, and I don't have to worry about cords.

B009A5204K,A3G07AKUPSTJU2,B,"[0, 0]","Love/hate with this product.For all the positives it has, I ended up returning it because of its' construction.Pros:- great connectivity, battery life and comfort.  The earbuds fit well and the sound is very clear.  It also holds a charge through a solid 5 hours a day.  I would charge it at the end of every day, so not sure how much longer it would last if I kept using it.Cons:- Although it is very comfortable and easy to wear during active runs and gym sessions, it just feels flimsy to me.The little earbuds are supposed to be held onto the neckband with little magnets.  These magnets are far too weak and barely hold them in when they are stationary.  They are also not the easiest to fit in place while the neckband is still around your neck.If you do manage to fit them in, the slightest head movement causes them to fall out.This is not only frustrating, but with them just dangling there, they easily got caught on my jacket, shoulder strap of my purse and scarf.It was an accident waiting to happen and I just knew they'd get torn off one day soon.Another concern was how they'd hold up being toted around in bag.  If you don't want to walk around with them hanging around your neck, there's really no easy way to transport them.  I'd wear them on the train to listen to music, but didn't want to leave them on once I got to work.  I'd put them in my bag, but then had to wrestle with a tangle when I retrieved them.Overall very disappointed because although user unfriendly, the sound and comfort of these were great.  If you're just going to be using them at home and not taking them with you, they will suffice.  A bit pricey for being limited like that though.

There is a trick to it. It is very annoying, but the trick is to un-pair then repair the headset EVERY time you want optimal quality. If you don't do this trick, it will still work, but it will sound terrible and the signal will become unstable. For this reason, I've written 2 versions of reviews with either ""Default only"" or ""Tricked out only"" to represent performance when the trick is done.Default AND Tricked out Pros:---Comfortable. You can't tell from the picture, but the band that rests on your neck is actually very soft.---Great battery life.Tricked out only Pros:---great sound quality---good connection rangeDefault AND Tricked out Cons:---Inadequate volume control on the headset itself. As other reviews have mentioned, the volume is loud even when set to the lowest volume on the headset. In order to avoid going deaf, you will need to adjust the signal directly on the source device the headset is streaming.---LG SMS reader software doesn't consistently work. Even the most advanced Android phone to my knowledge, Samsung Galaxy Note 2, considers the LG SMS reader buggy and it will interfere with your other text-to-speech/speech-to-text apps like Google Voice, Skype, Swiftkey Swype.Default only Cons:---Connection is frequently dropped once signal becomes medium. This alone renders the product unusable.---Sound quality becomes high pitched and metallic once the battery hits medium.Bottom line: This product has an annoying procedure to make it work properly, but it's still the best available in its class.

With no object obstruction, i can distance out 10 ft before the connection drops; 700 i can go 10+ ft and in another room with no issues.  On the 730, when going to the next song or fast forward to the next song, the first 3-5 secs are skipped.  Sometimes I won't hear anything so i have to rewind and forward again just to get it to play.  For the 700's, no issue at all.Overall, if you're looking for sound quality, then go with the 730.  I'm a headphone fiend and always looking for sound quality so i decided to stick with the 730 (returned the 700) and just deal with the issues described.

It is great because it is small and doesnt have an annoying flashing light. I use a usb lanyard to keep it concealed under my shirt and use it as needed. For my nightly TV viewing where I like to use a stereo headset so I dont wake other family members I was using a jabra clipper and apple earbuds. I evaluated the jabra street 2 but went with the clipper because both had relatively poor battery life and you could keep the clipper plugged in and still use it whereas the street 2 would not work when plugged in.This LG set is so much better because instead of having a dongle to drag around or clip to your neck with long cords for the earbuds these go right around your neck with no excess cording or unbalanced weight.  I cant even tell I am wearing it... I am about 18 ft away from the TV and the clipper often broke connection causing the audio to go out of sync from video especially if a body part or anything moved in front. No issue like that with these. Also much louder and better fidelity.I also have Moto S10-HD headset and they are no comparison, besides being extremely uncomfortable after only a few minutes of use the buttons are hard to locate and actuate.",5.0,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,48.23,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rkWJ3jIBL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

He LOVED it, so I decided to give it a try.  I ordered one from Amazon on 2/13/13.  I started using it and it was the best thing ever!  I drive a convertible and I could never have a conversation with the top down (even with the manufacturer's built in Bluetooth system).  My LG HBS-730 fixed that.  I've had not one single complaint of background noise since I've been using it.  One of the main reasons for me buying it is because all of my music is on my phone.  The sound quality is great!  The only problems I encountered is that the ear plugs would slide out from time to time (even after adjusting the sizes).  Other than that, the product works great!  It pairs easily, it works as advertised.Nevertheless; I noticed this morning, less than 2 months after having it that one of the wires that connects the ear piece is frayed, exposing the metalic wire at the point where it connects to the unit. This is from normal use.  So I checked Amazon for their return policy and it states that I'm eligible for a ""partial"" refund, and I will have to pay all shipping charges.  Not being happy with that; I called LG directly (800-243-0000) and spoke to Fernando (nice guy), and he informed me that their warranty doesn't cover damage due to ""normal use"" even if it's less than 2 months old.  I paid a pretty penny for this thing, so that was discouraging news.  At this point my only choice is to send it back to Amazon and look for a product that is more durable and better supported by the manufacturer.I would still recommend this product, if you're willing to accept the risk that if it gets damage (and it is a little fragile); you may be up the creek with one paddle.

The fifth time I gave it up, even though I loved Moto support, the device was clearly not ready for workouts.Samsung advertises this unit for workouts.

B009A5204K,A17KNKWCU3VQCC,Ed in Raleigh,"[4, 4]","Let me say up front that my hearing is not the best at 68 but I can discern clean clear sharp audio from muffled audio and love the sound! This review is more about the general design of the HBS-730.I have been a fan of Bluetooth technology ever since Ericsson (a former employer) started putting it into their phones (pre Sony-Ericsson). I love the wireless convenience but was never quite ecstatic about its implementation until now! LG has obviously thought through the design of this device carefully and has applied good engineering where it counts--functionality--and good design where it counts--comfort and convenience.At the gym, this is the first BT hearing device that is NEVER in the way, remains in place so the buds don't fall out, provides easy to access controls that work, receives and processes interruptions to my music or audio book listening (interruptions like incoming phone calls and self-imposed outgoing phone calls) without a problem, and this device so easily deals with issues of pairing.Not only that but this device provides audible queues informing the wearer (with at least one ear bud inserted in the ear) the state of the device power switch, the state of the device battery, and the state of the device pairing.This headset is hands-down the best BT headphone device I have used, and I have invested hundreds into these things over the years since the introduction of Bluetooth in phones and headphones. One more plus... the magnetic docking of the buds into the wrap-around neck piece is ingenious and the buds almost always stay secured to their base when secured in this way.  I gladly give this Bluetooth headphone my best rating.",5.0,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,48.23,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rkWJ3jIBL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

B009A5204K,A1W6TDZ4NPP091,Elissa,"[0, 0]","I had the HBS-730 in black and loved it, unfortunately it fell off me when I was thrown in an accident and since I was in full adrenaline panic mode at the time I didn't notice they were not on me until I got home.So I bought this in white only because the white was $10 cheaper, I don't care $10 worth about the color though I prefer black if all things are equal.Now I wish I'd gone with the black but I wore these for a week before I realized it and had thrown out the packaging already. I'll keep them, I'll use them, and I'd probably even love them if I hadn't had the the other set before, here is why:- This is stupid perhaps but this headset uses a different voice than my last one, sounds like just some random lady at the office that they recorded, I don't like her voice where before I'd really not noticed.- When the headset is low on batteries it gives you a warning, waits a while and then warns you again. My old one did this too but infrequently enough that I could keep listening to my music for a while. Important sometimes for that last 2 stops on the train or the last 5 minutes of my run! Give me the warning well ahead of time so I know to charge it but give me time to actually listen. This new one? Once the voice says the battery is low there is no point to continuing to listen because she interrupts the music/phone every 5 seconds to tell me the battery is low. I wonder how much battery time is wasted with that but it is so annoying that I just turn the damn thing off.- The bluetooth signal is just a bit weaker. Sometimes I lose signal when my phone is in my purse as my purse swings around behind me, one of the things I loved about the 730 before was that it was the first stereo headset I'd found that reliably maintained the signal through my body (I'm a totally average sized woman), this is still better than the others I'd tried just not perfect.I don't know if this is a difference between white and black versions/batches or if the quality in this model went downhill or what but there is definitely a difference. I suppose compared against other stereo headsets I'd tried I'd still give it 5 stars but compared against the other of the same model: 4 stars",4.0,1398729600,"04 29, 2014",LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,48.23,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rkWJ3jIBL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

I have bought a couple for myself and family and several friends have followed suit.  My 2-3 year old model with the orange tips is still working perfect, but this newer black one with silver tips has some great enhancements.  Instead of an ascending tri-tone for power on and a descending tri-tone for power off, it now speaks to you with a Siri-like female voice.  She also tells you when you are paired, connected, disconnected, etc.  This is a neat upgrade from the tones.This thing works awesome and is almost as good as high quality headphones for music.  Mine has taken quite a beating running and biking, and has been wet and muddy many times.  It still works perfect and battery life is still great.  I can say that I am careful with batteries though.  I plug mine in overnight every night and use it much of the day every day.FYI, it is not as good as a Jawbone or BlueParrot for phone only use, not quite as loud or clear, but for a do it all device it can't be beat.  I usually use one earbud when talking or listening to podcasts/voice and pop the second one in for music.

The noise cancelling is very good, no problems with background while on the phone.  The sound quality is good for voice and reasonable for music.  And comfort, I have the neck of a defensive lineman and its still comfortable enough that I would forget that it was there.  Battery life also is good, you can wear it all day connected to your phone with no problems.In short, out of the gate, it works as advertised.  So where does it start to come up short?First thing you're going to notice is the buds are going to go exploring down your chest very regularly, especially if you're wearing a collared shirt.  The magnets just aren't very strong.  Second is the wire management.  It has a long wire on each bud, a giraffe could almost wear one of these.  But these are unruly to keep up with.  They have a teeny easy to lose clip to try to manage this excess wire which is quite ineffective and easy to lose.The real problem with the wires is they are thin and cheap.  After 4 months, mine are showing breaks at the connection points on both ends, and I assure you I'm a gentle user.  I only use them at the office, no jogging or anything that might account for this.And then there's the cover over the micro usb charging port....if you keep short fingernails, you're going to hate this thing.

I loved that set and used it pretty much every day until somehow misplacing them after about a year.  I had read previous reviews for this product and was concerned about the range issues many people reported.  I figured I would take a chance, and exchange it for the older model if I had a problem.I am happy to report that so far, I have had no connection issues with the 730 and my LG Nexus 4.  I am able to walk approximately 20 feet away from my phone, with a wall in between, and still have a solid connection.  This is similar to the performance of the HBS-700, and is definitely enough for my needs.  I am not sure if they have been tweaking the components in these to address connection problems, or if it just happens to certain phones.  In any case, the LG Nexus 4 seems to work well with this set.Sound quality does seem to be slightly better than the previous model, but I unfortunately do not have the 700's around to compare.  Bass seems fuller.  A lot of my listening is podcasts, but when I switch over to music I have no complaints regarding sound.  They won't blow you away if you have listened to high end cans in the past, but for the freedom of wireless and the low price, they are more than adequate.I've only had these for two days so far, but so far, so good.

I don't know, maybe it's me.First off, this seems like it might be a knock off device, not the one pictured. As someone else mentioned, the on/off switch is reversed, there are silver bands on the earbuds which aren't on the promo images. But maybe there are slight variations based on the assembly from different plants. The other reviewer also mentioned there was no LG logo on his device. I didn't see one either, but there was a small sticker where the logo should have been with the words &#34;TEAR INVALID&#34; on it. Underneath that sticker was the LG logo. Very odd. Seems almost like a non-english speaker attempting to prevent me from removing the sticker, that it may invalidate the warranty? Just guessing here.At first I had tremendous trouble pairing the device with my Samsung Galaxy S3. The instructions (which don't appear all that professional) say to turn the power on, and the blue LED will light solid. Of course they don't tell you where the blue LED is. I can't find one anywhere. The only thing that lights up is the red ring around the &#34;call&#34; button when I plug in the charger cord. So I tried the manual pairing method. That seemed to work (though no blue light appeared anywhere), I got it to play some music. But the sound was pretty bad. Muffled, not much treble, as compared to my wired earbuds I got with my Galaxy. But when I turned the power off, and back on, it didn't reconnect with my phone. Even the manual pairing method wouldn't work after that.So I figured maybe the battery was low, there doesn't seem to be any way to tell. I let it charge for about 15 mins, then powered it on. The red ring around the call button began to flicker and the headset vibrated a couple times, and it connected to my phone. I got it to play some more music again, but the sound was no better.So my plan is to give it a good charge overnight, and see if it acts any better.

B009A5204K,A3HQ2B57GJNDDB,"Jason ""The Darkness""","[0, 0]","I've tried so many bluetooth ear piece. They're either not working very well or I still got complain about background noise. Then I opt out for a bluetooth headset for phone call and music. I look up Sony and Jabra clip on bluetooth. Both of them require you to plug in a headphone in order to use it. Good thing is, they're compact, somehow long reception range. However, I found that when you clip on those bluetooth on your shirt, those headphone wire will be too long. Makes it kinda bulky and lost the purpose of wireless (Might just well plug the headphone into my phone).This LG here, completely serve the &#34;WIRELESS&#34; purpose. I don't have to worry about the bulky wire got stuck with something. The music/sound quality is very good for a wireless headset. It comes with 3 size ear plug to fit your ear so you won't distort by outside noise. For phone calls, my friend said my voice change a little but I never ever got complain about my background noise again. My wife even said she thought I was indoor with talking with me. The buttons are plain and simple and easy to use, no multi-function key to mess with.The only cons is the reception range. It's very short and easily distorted by objects in the pairing path. I use it with my S3 to play music and it'll break up very easy (phone in back pocket). However, when I use it with my Note 3 it didn't happen again. Maybe the Note 3 has more power Bluetooth 4.0 while S3 is only 3.0. Overall, for the money, function and quality, I'll still recommend this headset over Sony or Jabra.",5.0,1381363200,"10 10, 2013",LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,48.23,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rkWJ3jIBL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

B009A5204K,A3O2NS5RJ7OU5G,Joe Wood,"[0, 0]","I have owned a number of Bluetooth headphones over the years, but none for about 5 years due to: (a) the fact that I always ended up losing them, and (b) the audio (sent and received) was always relatively poor.On a whim, I purchased these (HBS-730), and I love them. I realize that others have said the range is bad, but my phone is apparently always close enough to me that it isn't an issue. I've had no dropped audio whatsoever.For the price - under $50 - you can't go wrong as long as you're OK with the basic premise of the design. These wrap around your neck (or, for me, go under the collar of my shirt). For some, that might be uncomfortable. I don't notice that I'm wearing them.I love the fact that I can wear either of the earpieces (or both of them, of course) without affecting the microphone, which is located on the left end of the main body. Since one of my uses for these is talking while driving, and since I can't legally drive with both ears plugged, the design allows me to use either ear (and to switch ears) without the listener being affected. Audio is easily loud enough for calls with one earpiece in, and especially good with them both in (when at home, for example).I also am quite happy that these use a micro USB port for charging (as do most of my devices) and also came with a charger (which is worth something in and of itself). No extra proprietary cords when traveling are needed, and I've got another charger I can use with any USB charging cable (I don't think it's extraordinarily powerful, but it'll slowly charge just about anything).The audio when listening to music is stellar. Not audiophile-grade, mind you, but *vastly* better than I was expecting from something in this price range that included the Bluetooth circuitry, a charger, a cable, and so on. Most plain headphones at this price don't sound as good, and few sound much better.Finally, one of the potential drawbacks - the size - is, to me, a benefit. I'm far less likely to lose these.Are there nits to pick? Sure, but nothing significant, and none that take away from my rating for these in their price range.",5.0,1390435200,"01 23, 2014",LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,48.23,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rkWJ3jIBL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

All the other headsets were way more expensive than these and had way less features and not to mention were more buggy with the blue tooth connections..These were a secret until the word gets out ..Let me touch on the J birds they sounded almost as good as the LG 730 not quite + all the ear combinations on the J birds became uncomfortable after wearing for an hour or so , and the J bird noise cancellation doesn't work and everyone said I sounded like I was underwater when talking on them .  I don't want to get into why every other brand was inferior I will highlight why the LG's  are the best and what phone I have the Samsung Galaxy 3..  The LG 730 Tone + blue tooth connectivity between phone and headset always connects and never interfers when I go to my vehicle Bluetooth .  Sound quality the best even better than my 300 dollar PC headset .  The unit has volume controls so you dont have to touch your phone to even change songs or start playing them or answer calls. The headset informs you of battery life none of the above did that or had an indicator.. The battery goes all day I have to change my phone battery after 7 hours of listening to music on the LG .I put in a new spare phone battery I keep in my wallet the LG says it has a  half charge by then outstanding battery life .  The LG vibrates to let you know when you have a call .  The noise cancellation I drive a tin can of a truck at work I have never found a headset that someone could hear me when driving until Now ... The amazing part they can only hear me not the truck or the diesel engine and the pot holes and bumps that are shaking my teeth out of my head..  I get asked if I am on my regular phone when talking no one knows I am working .  So until now I can't tell you how long I have been looking for a headset like this and does such a good job LG please make more of these in the future...

And I still feel like it makes me look a bit nerdy so I found putty them under the collar rather than outside helps. Plus still no way to turn off the stupid LED that pulsates blue all the time. Expect to get looks as people seem to think you may be in security or something. Often I use with one side in to hear the world around me but still get through audio books or listen to music.Bluetooth does tend to drop a bit when the phone is positioned against you like in your pocket and has to go through &#34;you&#34; to get to the ear piece. Hoping they would come out with a version that takes advantage of the newer bluetooth standards but we'll wait and see.The good news is that I've had the prior version and now this one. With all my little complaints these are still dollar for dollar the best buy I've found on the market today. Very comfortable as they rest on your neck/shoulder. charge lasts for 10-12 hours and amazingly only takes about 20minutes to recharge.

B009A5204K,A1UR56NHJFNPZL,Kindle Customer,"[0, 0]","I love mine. Works with Android and iPhone. Great for multitasking because you don't have to worry about running a wire from your phone to your ears. These head phones represent freedom - no getting tangled up while working. Works great as a headset for phone calls (good mic). The battery lasts pretty long. I use mine about 1.5 hours a day while commuting and only charge it about every 3 or 4 days. The charging port is the same as most non-Apple smartphones, which is convenient for Android users (i.e. one charger fits all). They're pretty durable, just be careful not to yank the ear buds too hard (the wires are pretty thin and would probably break relatively easily). If you're really fashion-conscious, they are a bit gadget-y and may make you feel a little nerdy at times - just something to think about.ONE THING YOU SHOULD KNOW: if you are using an older smart phone (e.g. Atrix 4G), the Bluetooth technology is a little different and it does pose a problem - namely, you won't have control over the volume at the headset. I thought mine was broke, but after a little research, I found out that it was a hardware issue. It worked fine on my newer phones. So I don't recommend for older smart phones.

Even after reading previous reviews I couldn't resist additional features on the 730 so took a chance.  All additional features work great, especially the voice activated battery indicator.  I will keep it since connection seems to be good (with descent range) as long as there is clear line of sight, which works for me 80% of time especially when driving.  I can see this as a problem if working-out.  However when phone is in holster, pocket it does cut in and out.

B009A5204K,AYVGWS9V6ETEY,"Kirk Fraley ""Kirk""","[0, 0]","I've been on a quest to find the perfect set of bluetooth headphones. Instead, I've found two bluetooth headsets that, together, manage to come real close. These LG headphones are perfect for the gym. The sound is really good (not exactly flat, there's a noticeable bass bump....I'm an audio engineer and very picky) and they get loud enough, which can be hard to find. It seems like every manufacturer has their own idea about where buttons should be. These take a little getting used to, but after a couple uses this isn't an issue for me. I like the magnetic openings at the ends that hold the earbuds when you want to talk to a gym-rat buddy. I have a pair of Wireless Beats that SUCK for the gym. I usually take about 2 hours to get in a good gym workout. By the end of my workout, when using the Beats, they and my ears are really hot and sweaty. And forget about benching with the Beats on..... they're heavy enough to fall right off. Not so with these LG's. Even when doing flat bench exercises, these LG's stay barely noticeable around my neck, At the gym, I wear my phone in an arm strap case, so I haven't noticed any connection drop outs with the LG's INDOORS.And this brings me back to the beginning of my review. Indoors, at the gym, these LG's are as close to the perfect headphones as I've found. Outside, running or even just walking, not so great. My pair of wireless Beats are great when I run.  The LG's have a lot of dropouts outside for some reason.  However, running outside with the Beats, I've had zero drop outs.The ear bud inserts don't block wind noise very well. The Beats are over-the ear and block out all wind noise. I haven't tried running with the LG's, but I imagine the neck piece would tug at the earbuds because I'm not exactly a smooth runner and even on the elliptical they shift a bit (not at all bad, just extrapolating).

Ordered placed on 10/31/13 with expected delivery on 11/2/13 and it arrived today 11/1/13 at 11:20am!!! It was fully charged!! I was expecting to charge it up for awhile then 4-5 mins pairing process, but as soon as I switch on power and pairing with my phone and tablet, I was all set. This is an awesome product. When I saw a friend with these a few months ago the cost was much pricier. I was thinking to myself do I really want it, is it really worth it. I've been using an over the ear Bluetooth but it's been uncomfortable while wearing glasses. Plus I couldn't listen to music. Now I'm able to be on the go listen to music while walking and able to switch to answering those important calls.  I would not hesitate to recommend these to everyone!! You absolutely can't go wrong. I've been reading some great reviews and I'm so thrilled that can finally add to them and happy to finally own this great product!!Nov 6thIt has been 6 days now since I've been using this awesome headset. I realized the next day that if I'm listening to music, I need to pause before answering the phone as the calls drop every 5-8 mins. I initially thought it was my friends or even the headset itself and was able to retract the above review. I admit that I haven't read the instructions thoroughly. But I'm still happy and will keep this headset.

After about a month, I realized the Bluetooth in my car sucks, and needed an actual headset if I wanted to connect wireless in my car. So I bought this headset again April of 2014!Things I love about this headset:-take it anywhere, very little wire to get tangled in...sits around my neck and I forget it's even there-mic works flawlessly, people on the other end said they could hear me great even with lots of background noise-surround sound (in both ears) so I can drown out my own background noise-clear sound coming through for music and voice... it's no Bose, but it's amazing either way!-it vibrates when you get a call, so even without the earpiece in I know a call is incoming-music controls at my fingertips while leaving my phone in my bag/pocket!-sleek design and nice colorThings that could be improved:-better magnets for the headphones-the way the wires connect bothers me. I don't like that they head towards the back before heading back to the front, but that's a minor irritation more than anything-text integration for iPhone so I can hear my texts read to me while I'm driving as a 4S userOverall, 6 stars, but Amazon only lets me give 5!",5.0,1397088000,"04 10, 2014",LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,48.23,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rkWJ3jIBL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

B009A5204K,AYKBPF7FLR6ZW,lingomanaz,"[0, 0]","I have owned about 4 hbs-700 headsets prior to buying this hbs-730.  I didn't think the hbs-700 could get much better.Well, this is better.  I was a little worried about the range of this unit due to several comments I read online.  They must have fixed the problem, because I often find myself three rooms away while talking on my phone, before I realize I've forgotten my phone.The sound quality is excellent on phone calls or listening to music.  People on the other end can't tell I'm on a wireless headset.  I also like the silver magnetic ear bud holders better than the bright orange ones.The build quality is excellent, and they have reinforced the wires for the ear buds where they come out of the neck piece.  This is an improvement, because my hbs-700 headsets have all failed at that specific location.  Hopefully these will last longer because of the reinforcements.  (typically I've gotten about 6 months out of a headset, 7 days a week 12 -18 hrs a day, running wires, crawling under desks, taking apart computers, replacing hard drives, etc.)I've probably owned 20 different sets of bluetooth headsets.  These are hands down the best bluetooth headsets out there.  At $60, these LG headsets easily blow away headsets that cost twice as much. They are MUCH better than plantronics, motorola, jabra etc.I've seen some headsets connect by a small wire, and have been tempted, then realized this is a better design.  Here I can take the ear buds out of my ears, and I have a place for them that protects them, but keeps them handy.By the way, the headsets vibrate when a call is coming in, so you can tell your phone is ringing even if the ear buds are in their magnetic holders.The hbs-730 differentiates itself from the hbs-700 with voice feedback that tells you you've answered a call, that your bluetooth is connected, or disconnected.  It also vibrates twice when it loses connection with your phone, or gets connected with your phone.The headsets come with 3 different sizes of ear buds, so even the smallest ears and biggest ears will be comfortable.They are a little bit nerdy, but they also command a lot of respect.  I find that when I'm out and about on a very casual Saturday wearing  raggedy shorts, a torn t-shirt, flip-flops, unshaven, and with my long hair down instead of in a pony tail, people still call me Sir and Mr. MyLastName.  I was real surprised to find myself being treated so respectfully until I realized I had my hbs-730 headset on.  I guess it just screams expensive high-tech, so the person wearing it must be a person of means who can afford to look his worst.  ;-)Try them, you'll love them.PS.

B009A5204K,A1NQFT941TOTT7,Mandryke,"[0, 0]","Pros:* Actually quite good distance--sometimes up to 15m or so without line-of-sight. (I'm using this with a laptop; not a cell phone. Most cell phones have fairly terrible Bluetooth power.) Class 2 devices like this should get at least 30m with LoS, and this might even do so.* Audio is relatively good, if a bit flat, and the earbuds actually stay in my ears.Cons:* The magnets are pure gimmickry. Giving the earbuds a hard look will cause them to fall out of the tip &#34;holders&#34;. This will not prevent the cords from getting tangled or destroyed. Sorry.* The &#34;multi-point&#34; is also gimmickry. If you're listening to an A2DP via your laptop or tablet or something and a call comes in on your cell phone, forget hearing who the caller is, much less talking to them. I was just barely about to make out something like a voice, and my phone has *great* speech synthesis.* Non-A2DP audio is just completely terrible compared to a real headset.* LG provides no support for this device, as with most things they sell. There are no firmware upgrades to fix multi-point. I was told point-blank that it's not possible to upgrade firmware on this device. I suspect that's completely untrue, but there are certainly no downloads available on their site. Not even the manual, or a spec sheet.Other:Since it works for music, I'll hold onto it until I can afford some decent Bluetooth headphones--if those exist.

For someone who needs to take a lot of phone calls while doing other stuff (I take care of my infant, ride my bike, mow the lawn etc. while wearing these and taking calls or listening to music).The only Con I can think of is that it has relatively short range, so you can't go too far away from your phone.  Probably max 20' before it starts breaking.  If that is not an issue for you, then you should probably look at others.For me, it sounds great, it keeps my hands free while being really active, the phone audio quality is great.",5.0,1404950400,"07 10, 2014",LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,48.23,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rkWJ3jIBL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

I use the Kinevo 4.0 USB bluetooth adapter for my HTPC.Connection is flawless. When I turn the headset on the TV audio automatically switches to bluetooth and vice versa when I turn the headset off. I recommend turning on the HTPC before the headset as the pairing does not always work the other way around.  Audio works in both Windows Media Center and Plex. If there is audio lag it's very subtle IMO.The headset works great on a treadmill and elliptical as the earbuds really block out the noise. I can watch TV with the volume lower because I don't have to drown out the equipment noise with the TV speakers.The range is at least 20 feet in open space in my experience which is plenty for me.,5.0,1385769600,"11 30, 2013",LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,48.23,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rkWJ3jIBL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

I loved my Tone and figured this would be basically the same, but newer. It has some key changes which caused me to return the first one and now the second (in black).The pros:- The sound quality seems to be pretty good (I'm no audiophile, but it sounded good to me).- The form factor is the same.- It puts a neat battery indicator on the iPhoneThe cons:- The volume buttons are reversed which has me constantly moving the volume in the wrong direction.- Now it talks to me. This might be neat the first time, but the indicator beeps from the earlier one were just fine. These take a little longer to listen through. It's minor, but annoying to me.- The pause button does not work consistently with my iPhone 4S. The stop function works and serves largely the same purpose, but I don't want to have to hold the button down for a full second just because I want to hear someone who is trying to talk to me.This last is the biggest irritation for me and the reason I'm switching back to the previous version.

I have used these with a Droid 2 and Samsung Note II with very little connectivity problems I have seen in other reviews.  If you use it in an area where there are many walls between the phone and headset, then there will be connectivity issues.  Also, I have notices, if there is any more than normal pressure put on the phone itself, ie. tight pants pockets, the connection is spotty as well.  I cannot blame these on the headset itself.

B009A5204K,AC6LV5D2RKTIR,"Michigoon ""tech geek""","[0, 0]","I just bought these headphones for a business trip to a major city, and my impression is: Wow. The LG Tone+ is everything I want in a set of in-ear headphones. Note that these were tested on a Samsung Galaxy S5, which naturally has enormous Bluetooth range- I can leave my phone in a room and be across the parking lot before the connection drops.Pros:-AptX. If your phone supports the AptX protocol, you will hear CD-quality sound. (Note that despite not saying so on the website, the S5 does support AptX).-Yes, that means good sound! I'm an audiophile with extra-sensitive hearing, and these headphones are as good as you can possibly get in this price range. I listen to dance music (driving bass), rock music (midrange), and audiobooks (voice, treble). All sound as good as I can get with a full set of speakers.-Cool design. Of course the neckband is mostly to store the batteries and antennas necessary to make the Bluetooth work, but having extra controls and magnetic rests for the earbuds makes them very cool.-Good signal. After a good 8 hours of use, I've had a handful of brief stutters that resolved automatically within a fraction of a second. My phone has been in a front pocket, a jacket, a backpack, across the room- it's great.-Good battery. I had a 4-hour train ride and I think the batteries were only down to what the announcer said was &#34;power medium&#34;. Very nice.-Good sound dampening. Even when not in use, I sometimes used the earbuds to block our sound- like when passing a train engine at a train station. The earbuds can completely dampen the normal hum of a city, including nature sounds and distant vehicles. That's more than enough for me.-Easy &#34;one-ear&#34; use. If I need to listen- say, as I'm crossing traffic- I can pop out one earbud and use the magnet to hold it to the neck piece. Once I'm done, pop it back into my ear. Simple, easy, effective.Cons:-The magnets holding the earbuds are kind of weak, so they pop out easily in a pocket or just as you move. I leave it on my neck as much as possible.-Wire management can be an issue. It's not as bad as a traditional wire, but the design could use some minor tweaks. For example, why don't the wires just travel inside the loop for most of their distance? This would be an easy way to pin them back out of the way for most people.-App support for buttons is not perfect. My favorite apps (Play Music, DI.fm) only &#34;sort of&#34; recognize the fast-forward or play-pause buttons. I can usually stop music (hold the play/pause button), and track skip will work but I can't fast-forward within a track. Considering that these are fairly popular apps I'm wondering if I should look into a firmware update for the headphones. Regardless, volume and power always work, so that has me covered.Overall:-Competitively priced, great audio, great connection, great batteries. What else could a person ask for in a headset? I wish there was a version of this same product with over-the-ear headphones, but this is as good as you can ask for in-ear headphones.",5.0,1399766400,"05 11, 2014",LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,48.23,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rkWJ3jIBL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

B009A5204K,AHSOOQWJHLAZM,Nikesh,"[0, 0]","I have to say, I really wanted to like these headphones. As one of the few sets with Apt-X and given that I was loathe to spend over a $100 on a pair of bluetooth headphones, I went into this purchase with high hopes which LG promptly crushed.To start, these headphones have a very odd design. Maybe it's just me, but the earbuds we always falling out of the holder and if I wore a coat, they were damn near impossible to use because they'd always fall out, get stuck in the coat, or the coat would block the controls.I also had the poor signal issue that many people complain about. When I first received the buds, they worked perfectly, but they soon started dropping out even if the phone was in my front pocket. It seemed as if these headphones could not do their job if they had less than a 3/4 charge.More importantly though, these headphones are just poorly manufactured. After less than two months use, one of the earbuds stopped playing at the same volume as the other. I could not believe that they lasted for such a short amount of time. I still haven't bothered with the warranty process, mostly because I know I'll just get another piece of shoddily manufactured plastic and I'm not really in a hurry for that.My recommendation is that you save some extra cash and get a nicer set of BT headphones. It will be worth it in the not-so-long run.",2.0,1397865600,"04 19, 2014",LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,48.23,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rkWJ3jIBL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

B009A5204K,A125YTPPTOD3XT,P. Lucas,"[0, 0]","It's amazing how gadgets like these make our lives better in subtle but important ways. It's surprising how a little thing like a headphone cord can limit what you like to do. Going out to ride a bike, bopping around the house doing chores, talking on the phone with your hands full, you can do these with a wired headset but it's not nearly as enjoyable. These headphones have all the positives of a normal set of earbuds with very few drawbacks.Pros - Sound, battery, range, comfort, appearance, build quality.Cons - Color (pearl white), button feel, LED indicator.Sound - The sound is obviously very important to the success of a headset. I'm no audio expert, but I am picky. I know the difference between crappy, distorted, flat performance and good, clear dynamic range. With Bluetooth anything sound quality is always a concern. These headphones don't disappoint. I was nearly shocked at how good the low range is. Bass is clear, powerful and full, not muddy. I sometimes have to turn the volume down on a song that has a strong bass line because it feels like it's a tiny bit too punchy. There is an EQ setting for bass boost if you're not a fan of bass. I used to have a couple of twelve inch woofers in the back of my car growing up, so I'm a fan of strong bass. It's not enough to make you deaf, but you definitely can feel that the bass is there. You do need to make sure the buds are seated in your ear canal to get the full effect. It's impressive. I have high quality over the ear headphones that don't have this good of bass reproduction. I just switched from listening to Daft Punk to Yo-Yo Ma and the bass sounds just as good on both tracks. The midrange and highs are also clear, full and crisp. Vocals are beautiful. At full volume there is the occasional crackle or pop but that is to be expected. Not bad for a regular headset, especially a bluetooth connection. Obviously sound quality is dependent on the source. I found that sound coming from my Nexus 5 phone was noticeably clearer than the bluetooth from my Mac Mini, possibly due to the apt-X tech.Range - With a wireless connection range is always a concern as well. Great sound means nothing if you can't hear it or if it's constantly dropping out. Bluetooth is an amazing technology but has its limits. I find that normal use, if I'm not separated from the device by walls or doors, I consistently have a great connection. There can be the odd drop out, but not enough to make it a bad experience. I can easily expect to get 30 feet of unobstructed distance from the unit without worry of a disconnect sometimes double that range. Now if I move to another room, separated by a wall then there are dropouts. I expect that though. If your want is to have absolutely perfect connection and be in another room, these aren't the headphones for you. The connection is good, very good, but not that good.Battery Life - The battery on these beauties is amazing. It easily runs for several hours without hardly a dent in the battery level. I charge these every few days and have never gotten anything less than the &#34;medium&#34; battery warning when I power them on. The battery strength is liberating, not limiting on these headphones. You'll run out of juice before they do.Comfort - The soft rubber tips on the earbuds conform nicely to your ear canal without pressure or discomfort. They seat well and rarely come loose. If I'm chewing gum they gradually work themselves loose, but that's to be expected. They provide three different sizes. My ears use the smallest ones, which are still a bit too big. I must have freakishly small ear canals for a grown man. Changing the rubber tips can be tricky as they are super tight on the buds, but with perseverance it can be done. The main unit sits lightly around the base of your neck. I forget it's there most of the time. For some reason mine likes to rotate around so that the left side is higher than the right when I'm moving around a lot. Not sure if it's my neck shape or possibly a slight imbalance in the two sides that causes this. No big deal. The only thing I find uncomfortable about this headset is the pointy buttons. The volume up/down and fwd/back buttons are thin and easily distinguished from the round call / stop / pause buttons but they are kind of pointy and sharp on the ends. Not that you would ever scratch yourself, but just not pleasing to the touch. A slightly more rounded button would be nicer and feel higher quality.Appearance - Some headphones, especially wireless headphones make you look like an idiot from a low budget sci-fi movie. These don't. If you have a collar on your shirt these often disappear and other than the wires going to your ears they are hardly noticeable. I like that they come in black or white, the silver accents are tasteful and they don't look cheap. I was surprised that when I ordered the &#34;white&#34; color they were actually pearl (iridescent) white and not plain white. That was definitely a bummer for me, being a guy pearl is not my thing. If you're a lady you might not care as much or might actually prefer the pearl as it is a bit more feminine in my opinion. It's not over the top reflective and at just a glance you wouldn't notice but it bugs me a bit they didn't put that in the product description. Pure white would have been a classier choice in my opinion, but hey. The only other flashy thing I don't like is the LED indicator around the call button. It does give you a visual indication that the unit is charging and when it's done charging but if you're listening to audio in a darkened room it does seem like a police cruiser is parked outside your window. It's bright.Features - Multipoint Bluetooth means you can connect it to your phone and tablet at the same time to the headset. Convenient if you're watching a movie or listening to music from your tablet but still want to be alerted about incoming calls and messages from your phone. Cool. It allows two simultaneous connections. Noise canceling seems to work well, when I'm on a call people say I sound clear and no excessive background or wind noise. Very nice when I'm riding the bicycle. Text to Speech to read back sms messages worked with Apple/Siri but I couldn't figure out how to get it to work with stock Android/KitKat. There's probably an app for that. There are tons of in-call options, call waiting, voice dialing, HD Voice, call reject, etc. all considering you have a compatible phone. The magnetically tipped earbuds/collar are a cool design feature. Nice to have the buds hanging out where you can pop them on and off with little effort and they are always in the same place. The magnets are the perfect strength in my opinion. Firm enough to keep the earbuds there but not tough enough that you have to fight to get them loose.Build Quality - These headphones seem suitable for medium abuse. I exercise (biking mostly) with mine, sweat a bit but definitely don't get them overly drenched. I have a two year old that likes to play with the earbuds and magnets and she has yet to pop an earbud loose from one of the wires. If I left her alone with them in a room for ten minutes they might not work when I got back though, they're not that sturdy. I've read other reviews where the on/off switch breaks or stops working over time, mine still work about four months later and doesn't seem sketchy. I am a bit concerned about the charging port over time, it does take some force to push in the Micro USB charger and would not be surprised if it eventually broke. It might get more easy to plug in over time. I toss these in the seat of the car or on the coffee table when I get home and don't worry too much about parts coming loose or insides breaking. They seem fairly sturdy for what they're meant for.Overall I would rate these headphones very highly.

B009A5204K,A3HBS95IZVAHSB,rambo_son,"[1, 1]","I didn't get mine from Amazon because I didn't want to charge anything to my card but I did buy the 730 based on reviews here. I purchased my through another online retailer that had a clearance for new 730 with damaged boxes from shipping (so they say). The price was very close to the $55 they sell it for here.First Impression 4-26-13.I got mine from USPS today. One, It was very light. Two, The part that goes around your neck is very flexible. Although it has a rubbery feel there won't be that big of an issue with tangling and the sticky feeling. This thing is loaded with buttons and features for calling and music, it even has an app that's supposed to read your SMS (text messages) from Google Play.Features on this is a blessing and a curse for this stereo headset because there are more things you have to read and learn about in order to operate this. For instance: in order to sync the Bluetooth with my phone, the manual says I got to hold down the phone button and then turn the power switch to ON. There is a lot more to remember from the tiny but information filled manual. The blessing is that this device is modern and up-to-date. There is something called aptX that's built into this headset that can be used with newer Android phones like the Samsung Galaxy S3 which also has this. the aptX boasts better music quality that is much needed. I also love the drivers on this headset because this is what I gambled $50+ for.First I'd like to let you know that using this headset on anything other than a good phone like my Samsung Galaxy S2 with awesome music apps and built-in equalizers, is a waste. By itself without a good equalizer I say this is a 6/10. With Poweramp app (equalizer on / no changes, and low bass). I received sound quality from those tiny drivers that most popular/cheap ones can't even match. Hell, I didn't even need to break-in and that's what blows my mind. I was able to dissect the music I'm listening to. For the first time, I was able to pick out different parts of songs, and vocals are clear. I can actually make out what they are singing about in Final Fantasy Distant Worlds - Draco and Maria. I used a song like I Miss You by Klymaxx to test out the headset with the dissecting part. Only with a good equalizer I can give this headset an 8/10.Style. This neck band style does make me look a bit weird with the wire sticking out. There are clips on each side that you can slide to take away the slack and/or adjust length. Be Careful not to take too much out or you won't like it when you swing your around and feel the band tugging. This thing is really light and the end sits right on top of my collar bone. This so light I don't even care that it is laying on my collar bone. The earbud seals really well and very comfortably. A lot of earbuds normally seal too well and leaves pressure in your ears. This one stayed in my ear and does pretty well at keeping out outside noise. At the ends you can insert the earbuds into a slot to hold it in place instead of letting it dangling.This unit is comfortable, modern, sounds great, not so stylist, and has too many functions and signals to remember. This may not be a Bose or Ludacris Soul (I'm leaving out Dre's Beats because I didn't like them) but for an afforadle headset this isn't just a winner, it is the winner! Earbuds are really hard to get right because they are so small and you can buy tons of them and never get clean bass or clear vocal, and sometimes sound like a radio. For $55, this is a 10/10. Just about everything about this unit is premium for a bluetooth unit at such a low price. I'll write a follow-up after I tested all the features and tell you about how this unit does at my workplace.Initial Testing 4-27-13I was able to walk about 6 car length (front and back) without a hiccup and more when I give it time to adjust. Im not sure if it is the 730 or my Samsung Galaxy S2 but they both did wonderfully together. I had a few situations when my jaw bone would hit the track button and change my music. The back side of the earbud is magnetic. When I had it dangling and I was leaning against my door the earbud would stick to the door. I hid my 730 under the collar of my shirt keeping almost the whole unit hidden. I will test call quality next time.Update on Performance testing 5-27-13My SGS2 power button broke and it keep resetting randomly so I switched phones. Until I can get it fixed, I am using the HTC Amaze 4G. The HTC couldn't be more than 2 feet away from the 730, otherwise it would cut out. This test proves that if you are getting poor performance then it is your phone or player. 6 car lengths Samsung VS. 2 ft.

B009A5204K,A3JCBDXNF0ZB66,Ram-Z,"[0, 0]","07/14/2014 *** Update***I've had this set for over a year now.  What was good is still good, when the connectivity is there.  When riding my motorcycle and the phone is mounted on my handlebars with nothing between me and the phone, connectivity is good and stays there.When I am doing yard work and the phone is on my right hip, connectivity is iffy.  And I get complaints of echoing and such intermittently.  I thought is was my phone because I had the Android 4.3 upgrade which trashed my wi-fi and I thought might have impacted my bluetooth as well but two weeks ago, I finally got a replacement phone.  The new Phone (Galaxy Note 2-Verizon) accepted the 4.3 and 4.4.2 updates with no issue to my wi-fi this time(YEA!) but the bluetooth issues are still there.  My son has the same headset with a galaxy S4 and the same problems.  My wife has the same headset on her Iphone-4 and no issues.  Go figure.So, my recommendation is this:1)  Buy it, try it out heavily and return it if it does not work.2)  If you have problems, Do not wait to return it or maybe get a fix from LG.  I waited too long and the warranty ran out.When it works, the sound is GREAT.  Good bass (well, let's just say my ears like it but I do have a bit of hearing loss so fidelity is no big deal for me).  Good volume.  Works great with my laptop and android tablet.The sad part is a cheap Bluetooth v2.1 works better with my phone than this one.I purchased this headset for one specific reason.  To be able to listen to music and communicate on the phone when riding my motorcycle.  I did not purchase through Amazon but a local big box store who did price match Amazon.I am going to look for a Bluetooth v4.0.  maybe that will work better.  Note, the v2.1 that work better fit me terribly.  I've got a big head and those did not have enough STRETCH to get around the back of my head.Setup Description:I have the LG730 paired with a Galaxy Note II phone (Verizon).  The phone does not have the stock battery, it has a 9300mah extended battery(warranty ZeroLemon Protection Guarantee CompatibleI mention this because it may be part of the problem I do occasionally have with the headset under the CON section.  I use the case provided by ZeroLemon for my phone.I mount my Galaxy Note 2 on my motorcycle (2007 Goldwing) using a RAM Mount for the phone (RAM Universal X Grip Tablet Tabletsand the handlebar (RAM Mounting RAM B 174 LO4U Reservoir Lowrance.  I bought the wrong phone mount initially but just flipped the prongs around to the smaller set on the back and it works great.  No fear of vibration.  I used it on a 1600 mile trip two weeks ago with no problems.I have a 3/4 Vega helmet with a face shield that I usually have lowered.  I also wear a heavy motorcycle jacket (not a leather jacket but a heavy duty nylon jacket with Kevlar protectors and such).  The LG730 sits inside the jacket and I zip the jack all the way up but leave the collar open to be able to get to the answer button.  The ear buds have no issues as long as I have them stretched out all the way.  I only wear one, not two when riding so check your state laws on that ([...]  I can turn my head left or right and not pull the bud out of my right ear.Usage Experience:PRO:Sound Quality:  Excellent compared to the helmet speakers I was using.  Good Bass and volume levels that are adjustable both on the phone and the headset so you can get the mix you want.  I am NOT an audiophile so I'm not concerned about the highest hi's or the lowest lows.  I just want to hear the music and hold a conversation.Microphone:  Very Good.  I made several test calls to multiple people while riding my motorcycle.  Up until about 40 MPH, they could not tell I was on a motorcycle.  Up to about 70MPH, all they heard was a bit of a buzz from my mufflers but could still hear me clearly and I could hear them quite well.Call notification:  Works well.  I can hear the phone ringing in my ear bud, the phone itself and vibration from the HB730.Call Answer:  Works well with bare fingers and light gloves.  Harder to get with thick gloves but doable (Auto answer would be nice).Wearing:  They are very flexible and comfortable to wear.CONS:When not on the motorcycle, I wear my phone on my right hip.  Sometimes the sound quality goes to pot listening to music while walking.  I""ll get skips in my songs.  This never happens on the same songs with my wired headset.  Turning off and back on the Tone+ usually clears that issue.  it's not an issue with the battery life (Usually high or on medium) and my phone with the 9300mah battery is NEVER low.  :)  (Love that battery....)I've noticed that when I lift up my left arm, i lose significant signal.  I've got a normal arm, no metals or anything in it but the blue tooth connections severely weakens and the sound almost drops out completely.  Drop my left arm back down, I'm good to go. (This may be related to my extended battery which completely covers the back of my Note 2 phone.  I'll find my original battery and see if I can duplicate the problem.No auto-answer.  Would be nice when working out or riding so I don't have to take a hand off of my handle bar.Hard to find the manual on the LG website.  An odd CON but I was just looking for it(to see if it can auto answer) and finding any support document for the LG Tone+ other than the sales page just wasn't there.Summary.Even with the small cons listed, this is a great Bluetooth headset for my purposes.  I also exercise at the gym with them.  I don't run (yet) but do walk on the treadmill and no problems to date with the slipping off.  Running might cause a problem because the are not tight around the back of my neck and may bounce.If it ever breaks, I'll buy it again.",3.0,1383177600,"10 31, 2013",LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,48.23,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rkWJ3jIBL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

B009A5204K,A3B7NBM01191CF,rawtimes,"[0, 0]","i am happy with this headset on my samsung note 2. i have tried two other stereo bluetooth earbud headsets: theJayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight BlackandSony MW1 Headset Black Lite Version (Retail Box). the Jaybird had poor sound isolation while the sony had the very worst sound and was also uncomfortable to use. This LG is good. the microphone is by the neck, which i prefer over being on a hanging cord or on the ear. the battery is also around the neck, which i prefer to something heavy on the ear or something that has to be clipped to a shirt collar. These fit like normal stereo earbuds, with all the electronics around the neck. i find this to be the best i have tried. i returned the sony and the jaybird.this is the first set i have gotten in the last year that i was happy with. it is light, the sound is good, the controls are easy. works fine 20 feet into the next room. i called lg and they serviced me immediately. (the little three inch manual is also available in pdf as a download.) he said battery life is 15 hours on phone call, 10 hours with music, and 15 days with no use. when the headset is turned on, it announces battery life as high, med, and low. the earbuds comes come in three sizes. i find that the middle set is much more comfortable. this is much cheaper than the sony or jaybird and much better. i almost gave up hope finding a bluetooth stereo earbud set. the sound is comparable to corded earbuds. my friend said that the phone reception was the best he's had with my phone so far, bluetooth or not.i also got a car charger for it:High Quality Lg Tone / Tone+ (HBS-700, HBS-730) Bluetooth Headset (Tangle Free) Retract Car Charger Adapter- the retractable cord works great.",5.0,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,48.23,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rkWJ3jIBL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

B009A5204K,A30YP1B6XWP3S4,"Retired ""Retired, and enjoying my free time. ...","[0, 1]","I purchased this used Headset in April, 2013 for my son. So this is what he said.I acquired this headset as a used headset and it appeared to be well used but was in good shape. It was advertised used, but also was stated to be in Retail Packaging and it was not. It did not come with instructions for HBS-730 model headset, the instructions were for the HBS-700 so they were useless. The headset works very well, sound is very good stereo, great for music at the gym. As a phone headset, while working outside my home, it tends to cut out if my phone is in my back or front pants pocket, but works great without cutting out if my phone is laying on car seat while I am driving. Since it is a bluetooth headset, I would not expect that to be a problem, but it is, calls don't get dropped, but I just hear it cutting out and I don't hear what is being said. However, my main reason for this headset was to use while working out at the gym, so I am keeping this headset for that reason only. It is comfortable to wear during cardio workouts and stereo sound is very good, in fact the sound is way better than most high end quality ear buds I've tried. My next headset when the time comes will be the same brand/style and have the same functions as this model.UPDATE: Still working as good as when first purchased in April 2013. Reliable as long as phone is nearby. Pairs easily with both Droid RAZR and iPhone5.UPDATE 2/7/14: These headphones are still performing well for my use.

I can choose to use one ear bud or both depending on the type of call and the surrounding noise. They are clear and sound good. The battery life is good but I expected that.

I have trouble keeping them in. If I leave one in my ear and it does not fall out, I end up hooking it with my hand in some way and yanking it out.

B009A5204K,A2MLE5WC3TX920,Ross Barrette,"[0, 0]","I've had my set for about two weeks now. My goal was a headset for running and training for a tough mudder as well as for my motorcycle.Sound quality is great. The bass is slightly lacking but overall pretty good for an earbud set. Noise isolating helps drown outside sound, but is not noise canceling. When used as a headset on the phone, the buttons and features work great. Haven't had anyone complain while talking to them.Battery life seems pretty good. Two weeks of training about an hour or two a day and it still says high battery.Range is one thing I have seen comments on a lot. I have no problems. I leave my phone on the treadmill and walk over to a pull up rack about 20' away with absolutely no issues. I don't know why you would wander any further than that away.Gaming is one place I see a slight issue. To get the quality across Bluetooth they must compress the data because there is a slight delay on fast paced games. I tried a few online and hard drive videos, and the lag wasn't as noticeable.Running with these has one slight issue as well. The front portions of the neck piece that contain the controls tend to bounce onto my collarbone. This got annoying, and I'm sure it isn't that good for the headset to bounce off bone nonstop. I remedied this by putting the end pieces under my shirt collar. This prevented the bounce, but they do get awfully sweaty now. Only time will tell how they hold up to the sweat.I am eagerly awaiting motorcycle season in Wisconsin to test them out on the road.Overall I am very happy with the purchase and have recommended it to others.",5.0,1394323200,"03 9, 2014",LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,48.23,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rkWJ3jIBL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

Then I took it for a road test - literally - drove into work using it for the first time.  It was terrible - cutting in and out, un-pairing and re-pairing ever few seconds.  Called my provider - T-Mobile and did troubleshooting with them, but to no avail.  I have called LG and am returning for a replacement.  Will still be out for shipping back to them, so not very happy about that.  If it works, I will come back and re-rate.3-3-14  After perusing the interweb I found many with same problem since KitKat came out.  One recommendation was to switch off WiFi before hitting the road.  I tried that and drove to work with no interruptions.  If this continues to work, I guess it is a minor inconvenience.  I cannot believe that LG was not aware of the problem when I talked to them.  It would have been nice if they would have suggested this as a fix.  Also, my cell carrier, T-Mobile said they had not heard of such a problem.  Since it was a fairly simple search that found this fix, you would think that manufacturers would be aware, or are they so afraid of Google that they will not challenge their upgrade.  I do enjoy not having to hassle with cords as I am working around the house or yard and the sound is pretty good.  I can get 30-40 feet away before I start having problems with reception.

B009A5204K,AVK9BSXJJ51I8,S. Allen,"[0, 0]","I bought two pair of these for wife and I, both of us using them on same type of phone we each have a Samsung Galaxy S3.I will go ahead and get the bad out of the way which I deducted 1 star.The bluetooth signal is weak, it says 33 feet but there is no way in H E double L it will actually work at 33 feet. I put the phone on my kitchen counter and stepped off 13 feet before it started to cut out. So the usable distance is 13 feet.This distance shrinks considerably if anything is blocking it, it will sort of work in your pants pocket if you wear thin pants like summer time Khaki cargo pants, but for the most part while in your pants pocket you will get cut outs here and there, moderate to severe depending on pant material, which side (right is better) and probably even if you have large belly.Now myself I just put the phone in my shirt pocket and I never have any problems at all.Works fine in my car where ever I put it.Now for my wife, hers was cutting out worse than mine, she has been wearing jeans which is probably why, she has to put hers in her bra and works pretty good from there. I just ordered a arm band from Amazon a few minutes ago which I hope works, if not we may have to send hers back and get the HBS700.Now all the rest is great, they sound very good especially for BT ear buds, I would say as good as my Klipsch S4 wired ear buds.Having the controls and battery around your neck is a great idea because you can have a larger battery, easy to reach controls and all the weight is on your shoulder where you don't even feel it at all, just the small buds in ear so you can wear these all day.These came in the mail fully or at least mostly charged, have used the heck out of them for 2 days now and seem like I can go at least another day so I haven't even charged them yet.I am sure after a few full charges these should last several days between charges.The voice control is nice especially while driving, just push a button and say ""call whomever"" or ""play music"" or specific artist, with Google voice can send email, text, navigate maps etc. Basically you can just put phone in holder and never touch it.The vibrate when you get a call is nice certainly cant miss a call.Overall they are probably the best BT ear buds you can buy for everything BUT the signal strength or maybe it is the Apt-X latency, but what ever it is they are good for about 13 feet for good reception, maybe 15-18 feet in perfect conditions while holding your tongue just right.Put phone in your shirt pocket or possibly an arm band and you should be good to go with great sound.I have a feeling that this signal problem can be fixed with a firmware update, hopefully LG may do this in the future.So far all pluses out weigh the ONE minus so I am going to keep them because I can manage to work around the weak signal.(Edit:) Nov 20th.Got wife an arm band for her cell phone, works pretty flawless from there so she is keeping hers also.These would be BY FAR the best BT earbuds on the market if they just had the same range as the HBS700.But we are making them work for us, still easier than messing with wired earbuds.",4.0,1352419200,"11 9, 2012",LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,48.23,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rkWJ3jIBL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

The HBS-730 does have improvements such as telling you the battery level when you turn it on and the battery level is also displayed on your phone all the time..But there are major drawbacks :1) the sound is distorted at high volumes2) phone calls sound muffled3) sometimes when skipping tracks, the new track does not start playing on the headset until 10secs into the track.4)The music sometimes have short pauses as if there was a break in signal..Note these problems were non existent in the HBS-700 and the sound was much more powerful without any distortion on the 700..I'm giving away the HBS-730 and just fixing my HBS-700 to use, don't waste your money on this, just buy the HBS-700 if you can find it...",1.0,1387324800,"12 18, 2013",LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,48.23,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rkWJ3jIBL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

What I learned is that the correct sized earbud cushion is critical.  After I changed from the ones that came installed on the device to the large size that was included in the package I saw a world of difference and about a 75% improvement in sound quality.  Very good sound, extremely comfortable and decent battery life, what more could you ask for.  Actually, there is one more thing that makes this special.  It talks to you and has a simple on-off switch..  Now that may not sound like much, but I have a few different headsets and it gets very confusing trying to remember what and how many beeps mean what for each one.

B009A5204K,AQVNMYPUE1YUS,Tim Brown,"[1, 1]","I've had this about a month now, so far I like it better than the HBS-700 (I bought this one anticipating that the earphone wires that I can now see copper on with the 700 are going to fail eventually, haven't yet). This version has what seems to be a louder profile and the battery status indicator and voice prompts are a big improvement. It is a little squirrelly about moving positions sometimes and for some reason, it's fussy about which MP3 files it'll play without problems (for instance, I can play back one file using the HBS-700 no problem, the 730 choked on it, stuttering and skipping etc.). Guessing it has something to do with the encoding of the MP3 (I mostly listen to books). Dunno, just strange, so 4 rather than 5 stars.Updated 1/7/14 - I hate doing this, because as far as I can tell, this is a good product if you want to make calls or just listen to music, but since my main use for this headset is listening to audiobooks, for my personal use, this headset is basically worthless. I have the older HBS 700 version of this headset, and that's still working fine. Whatever LG did to this version, despite all the other improvements, killed it for audiobooks. When the audio book hits a pause between words, which happens all too frequently in books, it delays the resumption of the output until a few words have been spoken. I figure this is some kind of noise reduction internal software fight it's having with the input. I don't know, I just know that if you use it for this like I do, you're going to have a bad time. I've had to switch back to the older model, and I'm just waiting for those earbud wires to break on that.

The built in voice information software will tell you when you have lost connection if you walk outside connection range and will automatically reconnect when back in range (at least on my Samsung S4). Holding the voume button down for 1 second and it will tell you  your current battery level. Secondly, music clarity is as good as my Sony over the ear bluetooth headset. If you have audible notifications for emails and/or text messaging, you will get the notification sound in the headset and music will pick back up where it left off, the same with incoming phone calls. Microphone works great, even if you like driving with your windows down. It has little to no wind noise, according to my family and friends.Only con I have is that the magnetic ear piece has a tendency to fall out when wearing a coat or over garment.",5.0,1389312000,"01 10, 2014",LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,48.23,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rkWJ3jIBL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

The vibration feature and voice verification on connection status are helpful for hands-free demanding moments.Con: It only lasted 5 months of daily use before one of the wired ear phone connections failed. Earbud headset wires typically are the first thing to fail on headsets I use, because I mostly wear them while I'm active outdoors and indoors. I'm careful not to strain the fragile wires, but they occasionally get over-strained and, over time, they structurally fail. In this case, the overstrained region occurs where the headset wires insert into the plastic body. As much as I like these, I think I'm going to use stereo bluetooth headsets that permit plugging in ones own set of earphones/buds with a standard headphone jack, because it ends up costing me less overtime if I just have to replace the wired earphone part of the headset device. If LG, or other manufactures, offered better structurally reinforced earbud wires for the integrated headset products, I might go back to buying that design.",4.0,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,48.23,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rkWJ3jIBL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

I found two models of LG (HBS 700 and HBS 730) and I opted for this.  I liked the below features:1. Pretty light weight, you won't feel as if you were wearing it over the neck. Fits well around your neck under the collar or over the T-shirt.2. Sound clarity is just awesome. May be because of the aptX codec, the bass sound is just perfect.3. Long battery life.4. Magnetic holders for the ear-phone plugs.5. Multi-device connection. Note: all the controls work with the primary device only, only incoming audio from secondary device. Very handy if you have a phone and tablet to manage through.6. Even if you have the earphone in your ears for long time, you would NOT feel like pulling due to their lightweight.7. The range is good. It works without breaking for up to 20 feet. After that you would hear crackling noise and then disconnected. I would not worry about the range.8. Very handy while you drive. The controls for phone and audio playback work perfect.I tried it while jogging but felt like it was going to slip but never fell down.

Wired headphones get in the way. When not in use, it seems the headphone wires go out of their way to get tangled. Daily frustration to untangle. Not anymore. For not much more than a medium-priced pair of earbuds, you get wireless earbuds of comparable sound qualify. Solid bass, decently dynamic sound. Range is fine with your device in your pocket or within 8-10 feet. Within that short range, its connection is reliable. Good enough for me. This device was charged out of  the box, paired with my phone immediately, and the battery life is better than I thought it would be. You can use these several hours a day for several days before a recharge is needed. Again, good enough for me. Very comfortable to wear even when lying down.

As far as using it for a stereo headset, this thing rocks. I've read other reviews talking about the usual bluetooth issues - comes unpaired, can't get more than six inches from the phone, etc. I don't have those problems, and I have to think that those who do must have an inferior phone - maybe I'm wrong, but I have NEVER had those kind of issues, with any BT device. My current phone is a Galaxy Note 2. I have a 2200 sq. ft. home and I can set my phone down anywhere in it and go anywhere else in the house and still hear my music. The only place I use a BT headset for talking on the phone is in the truck. I don't care for the Tone+ in that application, simply because it blocks out most of the outside noise - just a preference thing, I guess.

B009A5204K,A1ITUNKZ2QHSX1,W. Tubbert,"[3, 3]","I've had the original Tone headphones (HBS-700) on my Wish List for some time and finally received them for Christmas this year. Let me tell you something: I had NO idea what I was missing! If I'd realized how great these headsets were, I would have purchased them for myself a long time ago.In the few days I have had them, I've easily used them for several multi-hour sessions (watching movies at night on my Tablet or music on my phone) with NO discomfort. In fact, I find it difficult to find earbuds small enough to comfortably fit my ears for more than a half an hour, but the default installed earbuds fit perfectly! (There are two additional, larger sets included).On top of that, at night I put on a movie or show on Netflix to fall asleep to, but wear headphones so as to not wake my spouse. Prior to receiving these, my favorite set have been a wired set of Vizio, which, if I rolled to my side, would become uncomfortable in the ear pressed into my pillow, and are often yanked out as the wire would get tangled up as I rolled around in my sleep.These have such a low profile in the ear that there is no pressure or discomfort when laying on my side. Even more impressive is that they remain in place even after moving around in my sleep. I just remove them on my first arousal after falling asleep. Even after using them the night before, I can use them the following day for several hours before recharging them for the next night.Ultimately, after only a few days, I purchased this model, the Tone+ (HBS-730), but kept the HBS-700 model for my spouse. The Tone+ solves my only gripe with the standard model: the lack of a mute; a necessary feature for professional conference calls. The Tone+ also add several improvements including a vibration alert for incoming calls and best of all, the ability for the Tone+ to be actively paired with 2 devices simultaneously (be it 2 phones or a phone and a tablet, for example).I am simply stunned by the quality and features available for the Tone+ given the price. It's hard to find a quality set of wired headsets, or a single-ear headset for this price.In short, I am very impressed and am very happy with this product that I use daily.PROs:+Extremely comfortable.+Very good sound quality for the average user.+Impressive battery life.+Simultaneous active pairing to 2 devices+OUTSTANDING VALUE (hard to beat the price/quality even compared to a quality wired headset)NEUTRAL:=Noise-blocking earbuds. Great for focusing on a conversation or your media. However, less useful for use with a Playstation and dangerous if used while driving (I have a standard headset for these situations).=The thin wire connecting the earbuds to the base may not be as durable long-term as some heavier-duty wired earbuds. However, there is almost never any tension on the earbud wires. But, given that I use them to sleep, I've purchased a 3-year replacement plan through Squaretrade for $10 (30% off) that even covers wear and tear.=SMS Text Reader app was not personally tested, but Android Play Store reviews seem to indicate that the required app is hit or miss based on your specific device.CONs:-Sound quality may not stack up for a true audiophile.-The Bluetooth connection can be tempermental. Even the human body, if place between the device and the headset (such as putting your phone in a back pocket) has the potential to interfere with the signal.

B009A5204K,A2RFHBEQL8WPV6,"Zarf ""-- Zarf""","[3, 4]","Pros:The microphone quality on the Tone+ HBS-730 is much much better when compared to the previous model. The stereo audio quality is also noticeably better. The additional features are well worth the price of the upgrade. I personally appreciate the ability to connect to two Bluetooth devices at once allowing me to use both my laptop and cellphone in cafes and airport lounges. Carefully following the written directions I paired the Tone+ first with my MBP then manually paired it with my Android cellphone, this sequence makes the cell my primary device and my laptop my secondary. When a call comes in I can press the MBP mute button and the cellphone takes over the audio on the device.Cons:The Tone+ has a severely limited range when compared to its predecessor. When wearing winter clothing, if I put the phone in my rear jeans pocket the cell phone will disconnect from the Tone+. While placing the device in my front right jeans pocket, if I turn my body to the left and look up (placing my body between the left call button on the Tone+ and the cell phone's ""chin"" region) I will disconnect the cellphone and the Tone+. With the device in my front-right pocket, if my wife gives me a hug, I will disconnect the device. I suspect larger people might have more of a problem as I can get the device to disconnect by wrapping my hand around the right part of my cellphone. That indicates the signal doesn't do well with transmitting through the body... and the meatier you are... the more problems you may have. To work around this disconnect problem I keep the device in a breast pocket while using the head phones in winter clothing... in thinner clothing this disconnecting behavior is harder to reproduce for me.Use the Tone+ with a chest or arm pocket and don't let it stray too far from its connected devices. When you move out of range and drop connection some devices (My MBP for example) will require you to turn off the Tone+ and turn it back on. The previous model could handle a good 30 feet while this model seems to be limited to 10 feet.In spite of these problems, I still rate the device very high because it is the only device I've found on the market that will let me switch between two bluetooth devices, has good stereo sound, a good microphone, and very nice voice prompts. This version also features a very very useful *mute* feature you toggle on and off by holding down the volume up and down buttons simultaneously for a second. This and the form factor are worth any other hassles. Just make sure you have a chest  or arm pocket to carry it in when wearing a heavy jacket. The bluetooth antenna on this device seems to be on the left so a left side arm pocket is probably the best place for your cellphone.*tl;dr* for the price this device is fantastic (it is even better than some devices twice its price) but it has very poor range and won't work if you place enough of your body between the bluetooth transmitter and it.EDIT: Using the Tone+ with my cellphone is rather straight forward but, after some use I've figured out this process to get the MacBook Pro to use the audio headset at the same time as the cell phone: First complete the dual pairing procedure as documented in the LG Tone+ handbook starting with the MBP then the cell phone. Next: to start any dual use session 1) turn off bluetooth on all devices 2) turn on bluetooth on the MacBook Pro, 3) Turn on the LG Tone+ and select it as the audio out on the MacBook 4) turn on the Cell Phone's bluetooth and manually select the LG Tone+ You have to repeat steps 1 to 4 every time you start up any device, reboot, or walk out of range.",4.0,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,48.23,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rkWJ3jIBL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 8},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets'], ['Electronics', 'Accessories & Supplies', 'Audio & Video Accessories']]"

Sometimes they're even scared of the ""little talking people in the glowing box"", but I digress.We had been using an old Nextel phone on T-Mobile that I got years ago for ""free after rebate"" as our guest phone.  However it was difficult to add time and didn't have a lot  of features.  For our most recent guest I decided to go all out and plunk down the money for this phone.  It was a great decision.Aside from the boatload of features and very easy to use interface it is durable and easy for anyone to add minutes at any time.  (I, or better yet our guests, can add minutes from the phone, a prepaid card, or by going to a website and clicking twice.  Better still, the 2x minutes work transparently and it winds up not costing a lot for the typical short calls and messages visitors are likely to make.The added benefit is that a week after our most recent guest left my wife had her phone stolen.  Having this on hand meant she could still make calls (using the minutes left over from our more recent guest...

As of May 2014, the Venice has been replaced in the Boost lineup by the MUCH better Motorola Moto G, which is a 3G phone with a sharper screen, faster processor, and the newest Android software.If your neighborhood is served by the Boost 4G LTE network, do NOT buy the 3G Venice, instead buy a Boost 4G LTE phone that has ten times faster data speeds.  If your neighborhood does not have 4G, buy the much newer, much better 3G Moto G, which is the best 3G phone in the Boost lineup.The Venice runs all my favorite apps, such as Pandora Radio (using 3g) and Netflix (using wi-fi). The Venice has a single core processor, so it is NOT the best phone for demanding 3D action games.The front speaker is adequate when you are making a phone call in a quiet room, but can be shrill at maximum volume. The rear speaker sounds good at moderate volume levels, but becomes harsh when turned up to a loud volume.Music sounds great through high quality headphones or when streaming to a good bluetooth speaker.The rear camera takes good (not great) photos and adequate quality videos in bright sunlight. On cloudy days and indoors photos sometimes have muddy colors, with poor contrast and will lack sharpness. Locking the camera at ISO 100 outdoors and at ISO 200 indoors improves photo quality.Battery life can be great. You can get up to 24 hours per charge when you are using the LG power control bar on the drop down notification screen to turn OFF 3g, wifi, bluetooth, and GPS until they are actually needed. I turn on wifi a few times a day to download Gmail and check the news and weather, then I turn wifi back off.The pull-down power bar lets you ""click"" the screen brightness to 100% for outdoors and back to 50% level indoors, which greatly increases battery life. If you are watching Netflix at night, a brightness setting of just 20% work well and extends battery life.Using GPS navigation with 3G will drain your battery in about three hours.

B009SP8X02,A3HPCRD9RX351S,Spudman,"[5, 7]","PLEASE SEE NOTE AT END.After lots of reading and asking lots of questions, this behind the times Potato Head bought his first smart phone, a phone now encased in a pink flowery case and used almost exclusively by Mrs.Spudman the queen of the technophobes.In the box there was no owner's manual, so I found one on the web, downloaded it, and printed it. Using the manual Mrs.Spudman figured out how to configure her phone, add and delete numbers, used the camera, text, add aps, and do all those things that others mostly take for granted.The clarity of the screen is terrific with crisp text and graphics. Photos taken with the phone are not state of the art, but are certainly good enough to send via email and post on Facebook.One important feature for us is the speaker phone because Mrs. Spudman hates to hold the phone to her ear during those marathon phone conversations of hers. The sound coming from the phone's speaker is good, what one might expect from a cell phone's tiny speaker. Using bluetooth we sometimes use the phone with a wireless speaker for better quality sound. On a side note, the external speaker on our daughter's iphone is not better than that on the LG Venice.On a ten hour drive to Georgia we used GPS for the first time ever. Again the non techie Mrs. Spudman figured out how to set up and use the GPS which verbalizes directions with a pleasant female voice. The GPS is up to date and uses a Tom Tom system. The GPS feature is wonderful and got us to Georgia and back and helped us navigate around Augusta confidently. We had one hiccup on the way back home driving through DC. Not sure where th fault lay but we missed a turn and got lost on the city streets. Thanks goodness the GPS rerouted us and we were soon back on course. Can't imagine what we'd have done without the help of the GPS.We did notice that the battery lost power quickly on the trip until we plugged it into a power source in our car.  On our last night in Augusta Mrs. Spudman didn't charge the phone, so we had only 14% battery power for our drive. We kept the phone plugged in on the drive and by the time we reached our next destination, the battery power was almost up to 90%. We used  the ""Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter micro-USB Rapid Rate Charger"" bought from Amazon. It's also a great product.Bottom line -  On the ten hour drive to Georgia we never lost our signal once. Boost has also been great, especially the diminishing monthly cost as long as one makes regular monthly payments on time. I like the phone so much that I WAS going to buy another one for myself.The internal memory on this phone has maxed out limiting what can be done on it. Also we got a message from Boost saying we'd maxed out our data usage. Mrs. Spudman spent an hour at Radio Shack with a helpful guy who got the phone to at least function better than a paper weight by deleting and moving stuff to the SD card.  He said the memory full problem is something he's been seeing with this model phone.UPDATE - Removing email has helped a lot with the memory glitch.",4.0,1365465600,"04 9, 2013",LG Venice (Boost Mobile),159.89,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41j6d7vyugL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 9749},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"

I have upgraded from the gingerbread based Boost mobile phone the Samsung galaxy prevail which was logy, took forever to open an app, took forever to swipe, forget about emulators, bad RAM count had to upgrade to a 4 GB SD card and still ran out of room. The amount of apps on that phone that I could hold on the phone only was only 11 or so. This phone kicks the crap out of that. I can play any emulators from Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis, N64, and PS1. Game board Apps like Monopoly run like a charm.

B00AKG2XSQ,A1YX6OF2QOGA20,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","I'm with T-Mobile and needed a new phone.  I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini international phone(great phone by the way), but it doesn't have WIFI calling (only T-Mobile branded phones do) and that feature is very important to me.  I got the LG Optimus L9 and gave the Samsung to my wife.  Here is my review.It's what's called a mid-level phone.  The high-level phones have faster processors, better screens, more memory, 4G LTE, features like auto-brightness - the list goes on.  My take on this phone?  I love it.The screen is great.  It's sharp and touches, drags, and scrolls are very smooth.  It has T-Mobile's old 4G data, which is really HPSA+.  It's plenty fast for me and supposedly, HPSA+ doesn't drain your battery as fast as LTE.  Speaking of batteries, this phone has a great one.  Poor battery life is one of the  knocks on this phone, but once I disabled all the bloatware wakelocks. it lasts all day and typically has 80%-90% left.Speaking of bloatware, this phone is loaded.  Every product Google ever made for phones is on it, along with a ton of T-Mobile ...stuff.  I took them off the desktop and disabled their access to the Internet where possible and it's fine, but if it really bothers you, root it and do away with them completely.Call quality is excellent on both ends of the call whether using the phone microphone or a headset.  The external speaker isn't the best, but it's good enough for calls, and I don't use it for anything else.  The processor isn't as fast as the ones in more expensive phones, but I'm not crunching databases here, I'm making calls, checking my email, and occasionally browsing the Internet.  It's plenty fast for that.I I was worried about listening to music with the L9, but using Poweramp and my Klipsch earbuds, it actually sounds clearer than it did with the Galaxy.One thing you'll notice if you buy this phone is the Optimus theme wallpaper is awful and there are only 4 themes.  If you don't like the choices, you can always use a favorite picture, and there are plenty of themes and wallpaper available on Google Play.  I went with a solid,dark blue background.I bought this phone because it was 1/3 the price of the high end phones, but I don't think I'm missing anything.

It arrived brand new in the T-mobile box, with all manuals, a micro SIM card (so you don't need to buy or cut down one), charger and cable.  I took it to a local T-mobile shop with a micro SD card I had from my previous phone and they quickly fired it up and switched my phone number to it.

At first I was pleased with the speed and cost, but over time I realized the phone has many shortcomings.First, the L9 (LG-P769) is near impossible to root.  Out of all the android devices I've had I had this is the only one I've chosen to not root because the method looks too difficult.  Two, the Jelly Bean update has been pulled by T-Mobile with little hope it'll ever come back.  LG has a terrible reputation of supporting their devices and since I can't get the phone rooted a custom ROM is no longer an option.  Three, it only has a 21Mbit/s radio.  This didn't seem like a big deal at first but the difference between it and the 42Mbit/s radio I had in my old S3 is huge.  The L9 only sees about 2.5Mbit/s down when the S3 saw closer to 10Mbit/s.  The latency is the same but it feels much slower because of the throughput.  Last, the device doesn't have a light sensor or an LED notification light.  I knew the LG didn't have these but I didn't realize giving these up would be such a big deal.  Neither of these are expensive parts and including them wouldn't have added much to cost/price.Overall I can't recommend this device.",2.0,1371081600,"06 13, 2013",LG Optimus L9 P769 4GB Android Smartphone - T-Mobile,136.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41lgh8xAARL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1235},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

This phone works with the old plan; you just have to transfer your SIM card. If you have a micro-SIM, just put it into the new phone. If you have a regular SIM, you can change the account to the (included) micro SIM at T-Mobile's website.I have used it to watch videos on YouTube, Skype, take and post pictures on Facebook, navigate, deposit a check with the Chase bank app, text, and surf the internet. It even makes phone calls!The phone is quick and the screen looks great. The plastic backing feels nice, but I will probably get a protective case for it soon anyway. The battery lasted about 20 hours with Wi-Fi and GPS turned on with heavy usage. I imagine that light users would get 24+ hours of battery life easily.This phone is the best for users who want a quality unit without paying a lot of money. Most people probably already have Wi-Fi at home, work, and school, so you probably don't have to buy a data plan. If you truly need to peruse LOLCats at the grocery store, T-Mobile does of course have data plans available, but I can't comment on them. I only use shared minutes, unlimited texting, and Wi-Fi, and it works out quite well. The Google Navigation will even work for short trips as long as you input the address while you are still in Wi-Fi range.To summarize: you can buy a great phone for under $200 and use it with your existing T-Mobile plan, even if you don't currently have a data connection.

Its internal memory, otherwise known as ROM, is, as you know, only 4GB. That wouldn't be so bad if you could offset that 4GB with a 32GB Sandisk card (for about $32 extra, or less). However, what you don't know, and can't know until/unless you actually have the phone in your hands and you actually log into your Google Play account to download an app, is that you, essentially, can't download any apps, because you have far less than 1 GB, depending on what apps come pre-loaded on your phone (mine has only 600 MB of truly-free available space). They operating system &#34;says&#34; you have 1.8GB of usable space, but, that comes pre-loaded with 600MB of what turns out to be non-removeable bload. Note this very clearly, that 600 MB of pre-loaded applications can NOT be deleted. It can't even be moved to the 32-GB micro-sd card. It's there forever (save a jailbreak, which is the only way to make this phone usable). Nobody will tell you this ahead of time, so, mark my words and see for yourself if you already own this phone. You can not move or delete the pre-loaded apps (most of which are useless, and which are listed below). In a very short time, your remaining 600 MB of internal memory will be used up with apps, and, after that, you're stuck. It's a brick at that point. You can't download any new apps directly to the SD card, so, you're stuck.  In summary, all the specs of the phone are for naught if you can't put apps on it. So, it's worthless. I'm going to use mine as a test case for my first jailbreak, and, if I brick it by mistake, there is no real loss, it's that worthless.

B00AKG2XSQ,A3AEDUJ7MXBNEX,"Sui Lin Chee ""Sui Lin Chee""","[10, 15]","I've benefited from Buyers Reviews, but I prefer a CNET, PCMag or Consumer Reports type reviews by technical evaluaters who are more competent. Buyers are valuable in writing about user and personal experience.  I excerpted Consumer Rport's review of the phone.  I bought the L9 under T-Mobile's new plan model where the plan (no contract) is priced according, $50/month for voice/data/ message and you pay the retail price for the phone.  TM priced the L9 at $241 plus tax (04/12/2013).  If you ""bring your own phone"" you buy the SIM card for $10.I had a MyTouch 4G (by HTC) which was highly rated, but my experience was just ""OK"".  My wife has the same phone but in White, and it is mostly useful in our house; however, HER data & message service is mostly unavailable while my handset was sensitive enough. I can't explain why 2 exact phones (except color) would perform so differently.The LG L9 seems to be worse than my MyTouch 4G in signal sensitivity -- the L9 has 4 bars, and typically only 1 bar would show (I haven't compared the db readings), and data service is very spotty in my brick house (data calls would time out 50% of the time).  I am considering returning it to T-Mobile and eating the re-stocking charge (maybe it's waived in 14 days, I have to read the sales contract); the poor reception is very aggravating.It is, however, the least expensive 4G data, Android 4.0 phone; the Samsung's are now price like iPhone's and they don't seem to have more functionality than other 4G data & 4.0 phones.The menu steps are significantly different from my previous Android 2.0 phone.  One dialing feature I REALLY miss is that I could type in the first 1-3 letters of my contact list, and my HTC phone would show in a speed list.  The LG Phone doesn't have this function which is a major inconvenience.The LG has ""touch"" buttons (instead of mechanical) for Back & Menu; looks neat ?  but it isn't.  The buttons are not lit, and I rather have ""hard"" buttons than hidden ""soft"" buttons.(The back is plastic which keeps the weight low; it's textured so it's doesn't feel cheap as it is cheap manufacturing.)______________________________________________CR's TakeThe LG Optimus L9 offers an impressive blend of intriguing features and apps in a thin and lightweight package.Highs* 4.5-inch high-resolution display with excellent quality* Top-notch ease of use, messaging, and Web browsing* Quick Memo lets you use your finger to scribble notes on anything you see on the phone's screen* Allows you to launch apps such as a camera, messages, or phone directly from a locked screen* Supports fast 4G data networks* Can snap a still image while recording a video* Front-facing camera facilitates video chats and self-portraits* Uses versatile Android operating system, with access to many apps and services&lt;Lows* Video recording is mediocre* Lacks a physical button for quick phone access, and its virtual keypad makes it hard to enter a number without looking* Lacks Flash video* Memory card is hard to accessDetailed test resultsThe LG Optimus L9 has an excellent-quality 4.5-inch, high-resolution, touch-screen display packed in a relatively thin and lightweight case. It includes Quick Memo, a pull-down menu option app that lets you use your finger to scribble notes on anything you see on the phone's screen, from photos, e-mails, and calendar appointments to the home screen itself. The finished ""memo"" actually becomes a picture that you can easily e-mail or text to other, as well as share on social networks. The Optimus L9 provides easy access to all main functions via a highly responsive touch screen that supports five home screens of apps, programmable shortcuts, as well as a home button flanked by menu and back keys. The Optimus L9 also provides a straightforward way to add apps, widgets, or change wallpaper. You simply press and hold a blank spot on the screen to summon a Lazy Susan-style buffet of home screens, apps, widgets and other customization options. Pressing and holding the home key launches a stack of screen shots of your most recently used apps. Tap any one of them, and you can jump to that app. You can also launch the phone, messaging, e-mail, or camera app directly from a locked screen without the need to first unlock the screen. You do this by swiping upward on any one of app icons that are visible on the locked screen. But this phone lacks the search key found on many Android phones.The Optimus L9 lets you perform Google searches by voice command, and lets you download applications, services, and games, and more from the Google Play Store. Its multi-touch screen lets you zoom in and out of photos or Web pages using two fingers (for instance, your thumb and index finger). It also has a handy on-screen drop-down status bar that alerts you to and takes you to new messages, upcoming appointments, and other items that need your attention, even when your screen is locked. Its Android OS offers better text editing tools and controls for managing data usage, and enhanced voice-activated navigation and dictation. High-speed ""4G"" wireless broadband data capability provides faster Web browsing and file downloads. The faster network also facilitates better Web browsing experiences. The Wi-Fi connection provides another way to access the Web, e-mail, and other Internet-based content, without using your data plan allowance. But this model lacks Flash video.MESSAGING: The virtual keyboard was very easy to use. This phone comes with common preset text messages, and also allows you to create custom preset text messages for your individual special situations or frequent use. Excellent e-mail readability and attachment capabilities. This phone allows you to edit Word documents and Excel spreadsheets out of the box, which can come in handy when working on the go. The Optimus L9 also supports Microsoft Exchange and Outlook for work e-mail. When connected to Windows or Macintosh computers, this phone can appear on the computer as another drive. You can then transfer data to and from your phone as you could on a regular drive.PHONE: We tested this phone under a variety of conditions to simulate environments ranging from the quiet indoors to noisy roadsides. It had very good voice quality when talking, good when listening. Talk time was an ample 7.5 hours. This phone has a very good mixture of controls and features for making and taking calls. Excellent keypad readability under most lighting conditions, even in bright light. Its voice command allows you to conveniently dial numbers from your phone book by speaking the name, without the usual training. You can also dial numbers by pronouncing the digits. It has Bluetooth for wireless hands-free voice communication. This model can simultaneously be on a phone call and an Internet-based connection over the cellular network. Can be used internationally. But this model lacks a physical button for quick phone access, and its virtual keypad makes dialing difficult without looking. Auto answer doesn't work with headset.MULTIMEDIA: The 5-megapixel camera has a short shutter lag, and produced good pictures at ISO settings up to 400. Camera has a flash, autofocus, manual ISO settings, smile detection, and can record HD video. Its touch focus feature lets you override the autofocus by tapping on any subject on the screen. You can even take a picture by just saying ""cheese"". The camera's flash and ISO-setting controls help improve your chances of taking better pictures under low-light conditions. Its face detection comes in handy when you're snapping pics of babies, toddlers, or other fussy subjects. You can also snap a still picture at any moment while shooting a video. The front-facing VGA camera allows easy self-portraits, and can support video chats. But the camera took only fair 1080p video, OK only for the most casual uses.The music player has the capabilities and controls of a typical stand-alone MP3 player, including an equalizer, music shuffle and repeat controls and options for sorting music by album, artist, etc. This model also supports Bluetooth stereo headsets, and can download music over the phone network. Its Bluetooth data support enables the phone to wirelessly share pictures, contacts, and other files with compatible printers, computers, and mobile devices.GPS navigation capability provides spoken turn-by-turn directions and automatic re-routing. The Optimus L9 supports the Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) standard via its SmartShare application. This lets the phone connect via Wi-Fi to share content with other compatible certified devices such as a TV, printer, and computer. The Optimus L9 can act as a mobile hotspot for up to eight Wi-Fi-enabled devices. It also supports Wi-Fi calling. It has 4GB of built-in memory, and supports memory cards of up to 32GB. Its memory capacity is beneficial for storing music, videos, pictures, and other types of files. But the memory card is hard to access.About - LG Optimus L9The LG Optimus L9 is a smart phone designed for use on the T-Mobile network, including its HSPA+ ""4G"" network.

The same for moto x).L9 fits your hand just right - it's actually very slim and not so wide for an 4.5"" screen. The rubberized plastic cover makes the grip perfect - whenever I take this phone I feel this is the right one. The phone also has the stellar battery life. I get almost 4 days out of it, with Juice Defender periodic polling. The LCD is just great - no fancy HD crap that consumes battery and offers nothing - this one is brighter than any crap from Samsung yet it offers the same sharpens (in fact I prefer IPS over Amoled - I don't need fancy and fake punchy colors but nicely readable text - this is better than HD Amoled on any Samsung I tried. Moto x had amoled screen which is even worse).The bad thing about this phone is it's low level specs. This just can't be a pro phone. It doesn't have enough memory and the CPU is slow. You just need more. After two years I am still looking for a phone that will add very little changes to L9: some 512MB of RAM more, any CPU but this OMAP and a bit brighter LCD.

I needed a replacement for my awful Galaxy SIII for international travel. The SIII had a terrible camera. The photos were washed out whenever there was indirect sunlight. The SIII screen would lock up regularly, particularly just when trying to take a quick photo shot. So the SIII had to go. It was stolen in Colombia. So that put me in the market for a replacement. I love the LG Optimus G Pro. But it's still locked in contract and is really too big to be packed around the world. The Optimus G is just right. It's a nice size that fits easily in a belt case. The G is just as smooth and fast as the G Pro. The WiFi is strong and connects easily. Battery life is very good. I regularly get two days between charges under heavy use with the G. It will last about a week if just sitting on standby while I use the G Pro. The G audio is very good. I listen to both an extensive music collection and audio books on the G. For international travel in which I will be regularly trading SIM cards I like that the SIM slot on the G is accessible behind a cover on the side of the phone. You never take the back off the phone. It's easy to swap both SIM cards and MicroSD cards. The back of the phone is glass and quite slippery. It needs a protective case. I've got a hard case on mine which makes one handed use easy.I picked up my used G that is like new for a very good price. The latest news is that Kit Kat is coming to the G. It works fine on Jelly Bean. But it's nice to know it will get the latest operating system. I'm very happy with this phone. Some phones don't age well. The Optimus G was released in late 2012.

This works just as well as the old Palm system, although I miss two things: the phone on the LG charging pad sits flat on the table rather than angled up, so it is harder to read the phone from my bed while lying down.  Second, there are no magnets to hold the phone in place and line it up like there were with the Palm. To be fair, though, the alignment doesn't appear to be too finicky and seems to charge as long as it is within an half inch of perfectly aligned.One other minor complaint is that the green/yellow LED on the pad is super bright and I had to cover it to sleep at night.",5.0,1390780800,"01 27, 2014",LG Electronics WCP-300 Wireless Charging Pad - Retail Packaging - Black,44.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31Ou9HyggEL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 4390},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Cell Phone Docks']]"

B00D2CRXKI,A37IRE9GZ0CZ7I,"Aliza M. Beer ""Books & Belongings By Beverly ...","[13, 14]","What Ultra has that Tone+ doesn&#8217;t:The Tone+ (HBS-730) weighs 1.16oz. Ultra has shaved off some weight at 1.03oz. Despite this, the way the Ultra is shaped and weighted, it actually feels heavier in your hands and around your neck at first. You get used to it if it falls just right over your collarbone and neck.The LG website doesn&#8217;t list them but we can assume that the Ultra comes with the call waiting, call reject, last number redial, auto reconnect, multipoint connection (Advanced in Ultra&#8217;s case), Easy Pairing, Battery Status Alert, etc that all came with the Tone+. According to the LG website's lovely comparison chart though, the Ultra doesn&#8217;t offer calling waiting, call reject, last number redial, auto connect, voice activated dialing, battery status alert, easy pairing, A2DP (Advanced Audio Disribution) or AVRCP (Audio/Voice Remote Control Profile). So, no promises here.The talk time is 15 hours for the Tone+ but now only &#8220;up to ten hours&#8221; for the Ultra. But the Standby Time now promises up to 20 days vs. the 15 days for the Tone+. Music Play is still up to 10 hours for both. Charging time is the same at less than 2 hours. I regularly charge my Tone+ and I use it for phone calls and the gym and on-the-go so the five hours less doesn't do me too much damage in the long run.Of course, with the lightweight comes only VERY SLIGHTLY different dimensions but with an altogether different look:The Tone+ is5.34&#34; (W) x 6.59&#8221; (L) x 0.67&#8221; (H)but the Ultra is5.34&#8221; (W) X 6.30&#8221; (L) X 0.55&#8221; (H)Both also share the memory flex strap with magnetic ear bugs that we know and love but that the Ultra now refers to as the trademarked 3D NeckBehind (Around-the-Neck Wearing Style with Body-Contoured Fit) Design. As someone who suffers from chronic neck pain, I was skeptical when I purchased my Tone+ but now I cannot imagine any other headphones for phone calls and the gym! Expect the same level of comfort from the Ultra...except that if you're upgrading from a Tone+, it might take a little getting used to the different feel.The Ultra now has Google Voice Actions Integration which may or may not be a necessity for iPhone users. I easily access Siri often using the headset.Though both claim noise reduction and echo reduction, Ultra goes as far as to say that it has ANC (Ambient Noise Cancellation) and the new JBL Signature Sound and the aforementioned Advanced Multipoint. And yes, the ANC is a big deal. I noticed a major difference not just in phone calls but particularly in sound quality. This upgrade wants you to believe that even bluetooth headphones can offer you the best sound for your tunes.Ironically, on the LG website, the Tone+ is beating the Ultra slight in reviews with 4.5/5 happy reviewers vs. 4.4/5. So it&#8217;s just a schmidgen. But really, it gives the Tone+ 92% positive reviews and the Ultra only 80%. I would take this with a grain of salt considering that only a handful have reviewed the new Ultra and thousands have reviewed the Tone+. Likely the price is a deterrent for some people. I've had my Tone+ headset for a while (as has my husband) and we drag them around all over the place and they still work and look just like new. So, yeah, the Ultra is almost twice the price of the LG Tone depending on where you get it. And as the LG Tone stands up to time fairly easily you may not need (but you may want) an upgrade.Owners have said that the Tone Ultra is much more Android friendly than the Tone+ which is very iPhone friendly and go as far as offering that you stick to the Tone+ if you have an iPhone. Personally, I didn't have any trouble with the Ultra using my iPhone. In fact, I was really impressed by the difference in quality as I was expecting the Ultra just to be a fancy looking Tone+ with &#34;new&#34; useless additions.There are complaints about the battery life of the new Ultra. iPhone users definitely seem unhappy with the Ultra. In fact, while the Tone+ claims to be compatible with Android, Apple and other Bluetooth enabled devices, the Ultra does not on the LG website. But again, I've had no problems with my Ultra on my iPhone or even on my iMac.While the Tone+ says it offers on/off vibration, the Ultra seems intent on peddling Google Voice Actions. Is Google Voice Actions the headphone&#8217;s version of Siri?The shape of the tips/ends of Ultra are noticeably different. Very Star Trekky. No, seriously, the shape reminds me of the Enterprise!Gone are the circular buttons. Instead, there is a small triangular button for play and an equal sign button for pause. On the other side, there is a button shaped like a telephone receiver. And the Rewind/Fas Forward buttons and Volume buttons are hidden away underneath on the sides of either ends. The earbud hollers are rounder.It comes with two on/off switches which are now inconveniently on the inside of your headset (facing your neck instead of facing out like on the Tone+). One switch turns on the ANC: Ambient Noise Cancellation aka &#8220;active noise cancellation.&#8221;The other is a power switch with an LED indicator tucked away discreetly unlike the way the &#8220;phone&#8221; button used to glow before. There&#8217;s no doubt this is sleeker and some would argue much better looking. I&#8217;m pretty attached to the way my Tone+ headphones look so I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about them.The earbuds are the same size but the seemingly minor change to the earbud holders (rounder, not squared in any direction) make them more snug in your ears&#8230;and a bit heavier.The ANC definitively makes the sound quality better. It gets a little getting used to the placement of the ANC switch, power switches and the volume and rewind and fast forward buttons. Especially because as I&#8217;ve mentioned they&#8217;re noticeably smaller and more discreet. I felt myself fumbling for the buttons and I have pretty small fingers so I can see someone with larger fingers fumbling even more.What really blew me away was the quality of the sound when I played some music off my iPhone. Wow. I felt like I was listening on quality headphones. The sound was incredibly rich! It felt like I was at an orchestra. The violins building on one side and the guitar and the drum in the other.The Tone+ does not even compare with regards to sound. The quality from my iMac wasn&#8217;t as good but it was pretty near my non-Bluetooth Bose headphones!So if you want some really cool sleek looking bluetooth headset with amazing sound quality, the Ultra is definitely worth the upgrade though the Tone+ are really awesome themselves if you don&#8217;t want to pay the extra cash just yet. This headset is really a middle ground between an awesome bluetooth headset for your phone and the gym and awesome bluetooth headphones...period.Enjoy!

B00D2CRXKI,AVPNQUVZWMDSX,"esanta ""esanta""","[1, 2]","I was curious to see how LG would follow up the incredible HBS-730 and HBS-700 models. While neither model would win any awards in an audiophile contest, their sound quality is more than adequate and between their excellent battery life and convenient, well thought out design, they have consistently become my go-to headset for most everything.The HBS-800 arrives on the market in early 2014 with two major hurdles: satisfied, picky users of previous models, and a stratospheric price.Here's what's different:Physically:- The shape is more organic and the neck band has a more contoured design to better sit around your neck.- The earbud cords are thicker and less fragile- The clips holding the earbud cords are stronger- The earbuds attach from the underside of the end of the tips, instead of the outside.- Instead of round buttons, they're shaped like a little phone and a play/pause logo.- The volume +/- and next/previous buttons have migrated from the top to the external side of the tips- The power button and activity light have moved to the inner side of the left tip- There is a new active noise cancellation mode activated by a switch on the inner side of the right tipOverall, most of these changes should have never been approved. There's nothing wrong with tampering with a beloved design as long as you improve on it, but most of these changes result in the headphones being slightly less pleasant to use. I suspect I will get used to them over time, but the 700/730 felt very natural and intuitive right away, the 800 does not.Electronically:- New active noise cancellation mode -- Not very convincing, but it's good at reducing battery life- Considerably better sound. This is the most welcome improvement on the 800, the sound quality is superb. Nice bass, delicate high end, warm mid ranges, the 800 is a delight.- Better microphone(s), quality of calls was already good and it is now top-notch- Two simultaneous bluetooth connections: the 800 can be paired and connected to two devices at the same time. If I remember correctly the 730 not only can't do this, but it requires re-pairing every time you want to switch devices. This makes using the 800 with a phone and tablet considerably simpler.Overall, I'd say the biggest disappointment is the jump in price, which is completely unjustified. If it were selling at around fifty smackeroos like its predecessors, the HBS-800 would be a no-brainer choice. At its current price of one thirty, the best thing is to wait a few months for the price to come down, and if you need headphones right away, get the 730. I think all the very negative reviews mostly come from people who like me loved their 700 and 730s, and feel the bizarre design choices and astronomical price point are a big let down. While I'm dinging the 800 one star because of its less convenient user interface, I think it's still the king of all bluetooth headsets and have no hesitation recommending it -- just don't pay retail!",4.0,1395014400,"03 17, 2014",LG Electronics Tone Ultra (HBS-800) Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,87.4,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41t2bCD8bjL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 470},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"

B00D2CRXKI,A222DQ2U6ITXT7,gelatinousman,"[0, 0]","Okay, so. First off i'll admit I was influenced by the previous negative comments, especially comments from users who have had previous versions (HBS 700, 730, 750). I bought it regardless to give it a shot and so far after heavy use, i've learned to use it effectively and quite enjoy it. It isn't without faults but it still is quite good despite the reviews. This device was evaluated over 1 week paired to an LG-G2 and rocketfish USB adapter for PCPROs- smaller LED light- despite popular consensus the ANC DOES work and it will work even if you aren't listening to music. It will drain the battery quicker but its good to cancel high range external sound if i want to take a quick nap.- the dedicated call and play/pause keys make it a lot easier to figure out which side is which- contrary to popular consensus from users upgrading from the HBS 700 and 730 the overhang over the buds while it rests actually helps keep the buds in their place. i normally hide the headset under my collar while I work so my previous 700 had the buds constantly getting knocked out of their place while i worked. this hides them and makes it harder for them to come out by themselves- the magnet holding the buds in seems to be stronger compared to the 700. I can only comment from the 700 to the 800- much lighter than previous versions- more ergonomic around neck with slight curve in band- audio/call quality improved from 700CONs- the cables are shorter so i have to do a bit of maneuvering around my collar when i use it, not a massive deal but just an extra subconscious step.- battery life IS shorter compared the the 700. but don't let that deter you, it still has a massive battery life with the ANC off and while resting in standby compared to other brand headsets- the multi-access bluetooth seems to prioritize audio from desktop computers only giving preference to phones for calls, not a major issue but makes using the multi-access a pain- the range is diminished in windy areas limiting range to distances as short as 1.5ft in certain windy circumstances- the switches are a pain to operate. i became accustomed to slipping my finger over the switches but end up having to use my nail to operate on/off and ANC switches- this isn't necessarily a CON but i don't understand what the JBL audio gives to the system overall. all i can tell is that it allows you to notice equalizer changesI can understand the issues previous users have had to deal with while getting used to the device. It requires a learning curve that most people who are used to the previous device don't want to bother with. One such example not categorized above is how to return the buds to their resting cradles. instead of holding the buds i find its better to hold by the cables and slide from under and let the magnet pull it in.at the end of the day i say go for it, if its not for you Amazon has a brilliant return policy.",5.0,1405555200,"07 17, 2014",LG Electronics Tone Ultra (HBS-800) Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,87.4,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41t2bCD8bjL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 470},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"

Below are main difference between HSB800 And HSB 730.I am factoring price in rating this product.No complaints on sound .1 Noise cancellation: Though this headset got built in noise cancellation, but its not significant and doesnt justify the price. When playing music both headset performs equally. But when there is no music hsb800 handles noise better.But i dont think this is as good as full size headsets.2 Design: Hsb 800 got some design changes. They have placed the volume buttons and forward buttons to the side of headset where as its on top of hsb 730. the size of buttons are very minimal and makes it difficult to find when not looking directly. So i prefer control buttons hsb 730. Once used to it ,i guess it doesnt make much difference among these two.3 SOUND JBL Signature: I feel either there is no JBL signature on hsb 800 or it was already implemented on hsb 730. For me i didnt get any difference among these 2 headsets in regard to sound quality.4 Price: I will buy this for the price of 69 but any thing more makes the upgrades insignificant.So i prefer hsb 730 for 40$ then 129 price of hsb 800.5 Battery: there is no difference in battery consumption.

B00D2CRXKI,A4V63DQQ4ROHX,Stolizino,"[1, 2]","UPDATE 2 July 2014.  On the last day of my return window, I decided that the problem attaching the earbuds to their cradles was so annoying that I would rather return this product and purchase the HBS-730.  I also downgraded my rating from 3 stars to 2 stars.  I do not recommend the HBS-800 at any price.-------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW. I decided to take a chance and pay a premium price for this upgrade after losing the HBS-700 that had served me faithfully for 2 years.  My evaluation is coloured by my experience with the HBS-700.I most frequently use this product with my iPhone while cycling or walking.  I also use it with my MacBook Pro.In a nutshell, any marginal improvement embodied in the HBS-800 is outweighed by the price.1- It's nice to know the battery status and bluetooth connectivity, announced shortly after power on.2- The battery life does seem to be an improvement over the HBS-700.4- The bluetooth range is no better and no worse than the HBS-700.3- Sound quality, always a subjective evaluation, is not noticeably better than that of the HBS-700. I can detect no evidence of JBL quality.  Indeed, the bass response on this unit, regardless of the stated frequency response, is not as good as the HBS-700.  The equalizer does not introduce a significant change in the lower range, although one of the 3 settings can produce a tinny-sounding treble.4- Noise cancellation is worthless.5- The design and magnetic interface between the earbuds and their cradles is clumsy.  With the HBS-700, the earbud and cradle make instant, secure contact.  With this HBS-800, the earbud must be tucked behind the cradle and perfectly oriented before the cradle will accept it.  Otherwise, because of magnetic polarity, it will repel the earbud.  It's so frustrating that it's not worth the effort.6- The single weakness I identified with the HBS-700 was the frailty of the earbud cables.  They began to fray in a matter of weeks.  LG allegedly has addressed this issue, but only time will tell.  In the meantime, the shortcomings in this product are real-time.Is the HBS-800 worth the premium price?  Absolutely not.Is the HBS-800 sufficiently unsatisfactory as to warrant a return?  Probably not.Would I buy the HBS-800 again?  No.  I would buy the HBS-700 again or the HBS-730, whichever presented the most attractive price.For the record, I paid $91.89 for the HBS-800.  If it were to be priced no higher than the HBS-700 or HBS-730, I still would not buy it again.",2.0,1402963200,"06 17, 2014",LG Electronics Tone Ultra (HBS-800) Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,87.4,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41t2bCD8bjL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 470},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"
B00D2CRXKI,A2DKQQIZ793AV5,Twister,"[116, 128]","LG Tone Ultra arrived in a very nicely packaged box with a clear full size image of the headset on the front and detailed functional description with specifications and additional features on the back. I actually did appreciate the functional description since it served a purpose of a quick start guide. You might ask why would I need one while being quite familiar with HBS-730? HBS-800 was not just a refresh similar to 700 -&#62; 730 but actually a redesign with some significant changes. You still get the same memory flex neck band design, earbuds magnetically attached to the end ports of the neck band, and individual controls for supported functions, but HBS-800 has been refined to the next level with an updated distinct look.Starting with around-the-neck flex band, now it features a better defined body contoured fit where it stays put even while you move around. Don't expect it to be &#34;glued&#34; to your shoulders as you jump up and down or do decline bench press, but as you quickly turn to the side it moves more in sync with your body. The top has been uncluttered by moving volume buttons down the Call side of the band, and song transport buttons down the Audio Playback side of the band. For a diehard fans of HBS-700/730 these changes probably going to take a little bit of time to get used to, but I found them to be an improvement in ergonomics because now you can control these buttons with your thumbs. The next big visible change was Call and Audio Playback buttons. What used to be a round generic button with a blinking light, which I found to be distracting on a few occasions, now is a beautifully crafted buttons in a shape of a phone handset and play/pause symbols. That really added a touch of class to the headset, and also made it convenient to distinguish button functionality by touch even in a dark. Another big change was an update to where you attach earbuds. Though it's still at the tip of the neck band, now it's completely covered from the top. I found this change to be both a step back and forward at the same time. This change makes it more difficult to &#34;park&#34; earbuds by simply bringing them close to the ends of the neck band like it was with 700/730. Now, you need more effort to make sure they are positioned correctly before attaching them. But the benefit is that design looks cleaner, and you don't have to worry about knocking them down by mistake. That was actually one of the minor issues I had with HBS-730 where half of the time I found earbuds hanging after I accidentally knock them down.The light indicator also got relocated down to the inner side next to the power switch. I was very happy LG kept the physical power switch considering so many other headphone manufacturers prefer to consolidate multiple controls into multifunction buttons. Here, there is no confusion when headset is on or off which also controls pair up with your phone. To my surprise, closer examination of inner side of headphones revealed another power switch. As it turned out, HBS-800 added a new feature with active Ambient Noise Cancellation (ANC) functionality. Using a basic principle of sampling ambient noise and negating it with an inverse soundwave, this feature was cleverly implemented to work independent of headphone being on or off. This way you don't even need to turn your headset to pair up with your phone, and instead just turn the ANC control on to use HBS-800 as noise canceling earplugs - great for saving the battery. The same with power on, if you don't require ANC feature, which introduces a slight hissing background noise, you can turn it off and enjoy your music with a highest level of signal-to-noise ratio. Also to note, the charging power connector remained a standard micro-usb so you can use any of your phone/tablet charging cable. Or use the included high quality usb to micro-usb cable to charge your headset from any PC or external battery or wall charger. Full charging from zero shouldn't take more than 2 hours, and battery life remained stellar at 10+ hours.Moving on, pair up with a phone was flawless and headset got connected to the phone and media audio within seconds with an audible confirmation. As with a previous models, HBS-800 supports all the major BT3.0 standards such as HSP, HFP, A2DP, and AVRCP. I also appreciate how turning the headset on tells you the battery status, which also can be accessed later by pressing volume button down. In addition, I tested multi-point connection where I paired up Note 2 and S5 without any issues. I was able to stream audio from my Note 2 while a call to S5 paused it and then resumed playing music after I was done with a call. This becomes very useful, for example, when you are streaming audio or watching video wirelessly connected to your tablet and can also pick up the call from your paired up phone without taking headphones off and manually pausing your tablet activities. Speaking of calls, I actually did some testing being outside in a wind, and everything sounded crystal clear on both ends of the connection.And speaking of crystal clear, I'm saving the best for last. With a release of Tone Ultra, LG teamed up with JBL using their patented Harmon audio drivers. One thing a lot of people don't realize, you need to treat HBS-800 just like any other in-ear headphones, which means you have to start by selecting a proper eartip from the included selection of S/M/L pairs. The proper eartip fitment will make or break the sound. That is why I see so many people writing their comments about not noticing a sound difference between 730 and 800. Without a tight seal you will not be able to appreciate a new rich warm sound with a deep punchy bass and a clear detailed mids and highs. Don't get me wrong, these are not audiophile quality headphones, but with enhancement of new JBL audio drivers and support of aptX which reduces compression of wireless sound - these actually sound very good! By default HBS-800 is set to bass enhanced mode which can be changed to a more balanced/normal sound or treble enhanced sound. To me, the sound improvement was one of the main changes stepping up to HBS-800 model where I finally was able to enjoy some decent bass! And just like with 700/730 models, the separation of volume and song transport controls (to skip next/prev as well as rewind forward or back) enhanced the listening experience where unlike with some other wireless headsets you no longer have to remember to short or long press volume buttons in order to switch between volume and track control. Google NOW worked flawlessly as well.Overall, while being a big fan and a long term user of HBS-730, I approached this review a little cautiously trying to figure out if the price premium of HBS-800 will justify choosing it over recently reduced in price HBS-730 model. After a closer look and continuous use over the weekend, I was able to fully justify that. The redesign with an improved ergonomics, including neck band shape and a more logical relocation and change of buttons, the addition of independently controlled ANC (though might not be necessary for some, a bonus for others), and the improvement in sound quality (as long as you choose a correct silicone eartips), made a significant enough improvement in overall decision to move from HBS-730 to HBS-800 which I'm planning to do. Without a doubt YMMV and for some creatures of habit not every change will be welcomed, but hopefully my review will be able to guide you if you are thinking about the upgrade or just looking to purchase your first set of LG Tones. Also, be careful when you are shopping around especially on Amazon where there is a number of look-a-like low quality knock offs.",5.0,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",LG Electronics Tone Ultra (HBS-800) Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,87.4,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41t2bCD8bjL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 470},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"

I also purchased the 750 model t the same time as the 800's.The clasps that hold the wires to the neck band are considerably better and thicker than the 730's, which were pointless. The curved design of the phalanges rest better around the neck than before. Having the volume, advance, and reverse buttons on the outside edges instead of the top are also an improvement. On the original model, I would sometimes lose my place to what I was listening to as my chin inadvertently touched the buttons.The Call button and the Play/Pause are still on the top near the ends, but as the arms curve downward and the buttons themselves are more receded, the inadvertent touch is less likely. On the 750 model, all the buttons are on the outside edge. The reduced glare of the indicator light as well as it's new positioning on the inside is also less distracting from the original model too.As for sound quality it also seems a marked improvement. In the original model, I would sometimes lose out on the first second of what I was listening to as the bluetooth attempted to process the sound as it transitioned from one track to another. This 800 model does not have that issue.However, on occasion there would be a sound distortion that is rather unpleasant to the ear that comes in the form of a high pitched scramble of noise that hisses than culminates into a pop. Luckily it does not happen too often, one can only guess that it is the bluetooth having difficulty processing that set of information to transfer it into the desired sound.I sometimes watch movies on my iPhone with this headset, and listen to a collection of music videos too (I like to have the video's instead of just the song). But what I mainly use this for is listening to audiobooks while driving so as to not disturb my fellow passengers who have their own forms of entertainment.Now, this headset is not nearly as adept at handling phone conversation as a dedicated headset with noise cancelling like the Plantronics Voyager Legend (which I have also). I have had issue sometimes with people not clearly hearing what I'm saying. I cannot speak to the google voice activation integration cause I have not attempted to use it for such. But if people are at issue with hearing me, I doubt google is any better. Or Siri..The Ambient Noise Cancelling works, though how well is a matter of opinion, though one can tell the difference when activated. The use per charge is excellent, They seem to last forever, and the 750 model last about 5 hours longer than that.The product is lightweight and you can easily forget you are wearing them. So to wrap up, they are great for listening to whatever whenever, but not so great for having a conversation on the go, unless of course you are stationary in a quiet room I suppose, then in that case they are fine...",4.0,1404345600,"07 3, 2014",LG Electronics Tone Ultra (HBS-800) Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black,87.4,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41t2bCD8bjL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 470},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"

B00D9AOU3G,A3LDPF5FMB782Z,Alan  Houston,"[118, 126]","The LG F3 is Virgin's first 4G LTE phone with both a light and compact body and an affordable price. It is sometimes discounted to under $100, making it a bargain.A MAJOR flaw: a tiny 1.2gb of internal memory for apps and app updates. If you are willing to learn how to overcome this flaw, the F3 is a terrific phone. The LG Optimus F3 is half the price of some much larger, much heavier 4G LTE phones.A MINOR flaw:  Wi-Fi connections can be flaky.  Half a web page downloads and then Wi-Fi disconnects.  I must reset my home router several times a day.The F3 provides up to 24 hours per battery charge compared with 10 hours for many 4G LTE Android phones. Weak points include a mediocre camera and average rear speaker for music, and a processor too slow for some demanding games.You can add a 16gb or 32gb SD card to store your music and videos but the limited internal memory will block the installation of some very large games. I was able to move some of my larger apps to the external SD card, but Google apps, such as Maps and Navigation must remain in internal memory.FREEING INTERNAL MEMORY: You can free a ton of internal memory in ""settings"" by going to the ""all apps"" tab. Next, look at every app using more than 1 meg of memory. If you don't use an app, uninstall its updates, uncheck notifications, then select delete or disable.Apps most people can delete or disable include Google+, Google Books, Google Magazines, Google TV, Google Books, and the Chrome browser app. Be sure to uninstall all updates before disabling an app. You can re-enable an app in the future.CASE WARNING: The Sprint/Virgin Mobile LS720 model has different body contours and microphone placment compared with the T-Mobile/MetroPCS MS659 version. Wedging your phone into the wrong size case may damage your phone. When you buy a case, make sure the vendor is selling you the correct case.This is a  good phone if your neighborhood has strong Sprint/Virgin coverage.

Simply format the file system as FAT32, and your phone can have tons more storage than the typical phone that has no room for memory expansion. Note the 4 GB size limit for files on FAT32 partitions.-Some apps can be removed or disabled, which can free up memory and speed up the phone a bit more.-Along with many other current LG devices running on JellyBean, it is set to update to KitKat in the next few months!-Active community on androidforums.com that can help you out if you want to take the leap and root your F3 for added functionality.CONS:-Short on memory; only 1.2 GB available out of the box.-Rooting required to expand memory.-Extra case needed for protection, as F3's backside is slippery.-Some large apps may not run on the phone, even with the capable CPU and GPU on board.-Gorilla Glass is great for light falls, but a bunch of videos on YouTube show that they aren't indestructible. Unless your device has version 3, which probably isn't on the F3.-Screen protector and extra outer case still required for max protection.I bought this phone to replace a Kyocera Event. While that phone still works relatively well, it had begun to look slow to me, even when doing some basic tasks like reading web pages and e-mails. I've had that one for about six months, but if it's combined with the Kyocera Rise I boot looped, that's about 1 1/2 years on the same basic hardware. The Rise has the tiny rubberized keyboard, which was kind of sticky to work with.The first thing I noticed from the Event was that the layout of the side buttons are identical, along with the headphone jack. The one difference was the micro USB port. It's at the bottom, under three keys for back, home and menu. Having a physical home key, with a colorful LED to frame it, is a nice touch for this phone.The body itself is a slim design, with a metallic frame outlining the screen. The textured back is pretty to look at, but doesn't have much grip to it. As great as the design is, all of that takes a back seat once it's got a case on it.At first, I ran the phone without activating it. This gave me an idea on how well it connects to WiFi, and allowed me to evaluate the audio and video quality. Coming from an Event, I was pleased with the speed of the interface. I didn't experience any lag, and the games I ran on it were as fast as I'd ever seen on a budget phone. I was glad to see that at least some apps could be disabled (if not removed).Though I knew I'd eventually root the phone, I could see myself being satisfied decently even if I didn't. The fact that I could effectively use a card larger than 32 GB was awesome to behold. A great thing, as it's not too expensive to get a 64 GB card these days. The Transcend Class 10 I chose was $35 at B&H; Photo in New York City (plus a few bucks for one day USPS Priority Mail).Once activated, a few of the Virgin Mobile apps downloaded onto my phone. Thankfully, only three apps were loaded. Two of them can be disabled, so you can avoid having them run in the background.About four days into running the phone unrooted (and two weeks of research on rooting), I finally did the deed. I rooted the phone, divided the external SD card to expand the small bit of internal memory, and used a couple of linking apps to also help with expanding memory. I loaded a bunch of apps I was using with my Kyocera Event onto the phone. Based on a short list that I found on vmroms.com, I removed a few apps from the phone. I now have something that really does feel like a tiny PC with a phone attached to it. All for around $130! It's not exactly a Samsung S3 or S4, but whatever. I'm still not sure I'll use the overclock kernel that one user created on androidforums (for now). No serious problems have been reported with using it. The overclock kernel raises the speed of both the main CPU, and the graphics processor beyond stock speeds.I can say I would recommend this phone for anyone that wants a powerhouse on a small budget, if you don't mind the rooting process. I've rooted every Android device I've owned since 2011 (four in total), but only after at least a few weeks of asking questions, researching the issues, and making up my own mind about it.Even if you don't root it, you can still do well with this phone. There are several good alternatives to the official apps of most social sites that won't take your RAM out for a late, fattening dinner. If you don't care for large, possibly addictive games, you'll do fine. Anyway, if you don't root, I'd bet you can enjoy this phone for the amount of video and music that can be stored on it. The dual core CPU and fast graphics are just fine for entertaining. Plus, now you can video chat with your pals on Skype... a lot can be done without rooting. Not to mention the upcoming update to KitKat! I'd say that alone is worth getting this phone now.If you made it this far, awesome! I'm done for now.

B00D9AOU3G,A2J6407B4TJFOW,"Mike Frerkes ""Mike""","[23, 25]","With Virgin Mobile's ever-expanding roster of Android (and now iOS) phones, it's safe to say the Optimus F3 is somewhere between an entry-level and mid-range device in the world of prepaid mobile.  The dual-core processor is powerful enough to handle most apps, with the exception of some demanding 3D titles.  The 4"" screen is certainly above average for a phone in this category, but it might disappoint those hoping for an S3/iPhone 5 experience.  Probably the most enticing aspect of the F3 is its battery life.  This is one of the few Virgin Mobile Android phones I've had (and I've had many) that can easily go a full day on a complete charge.  With the Moto Triumph and EVO 4G, you were lucky to make it to mid-afternoon before the low battery notifications began firing off.Being a entry-level/mid-range device, you'll find most of the hardware to be entirely  acceptable but not incredible.  The camera does a serviceable job at 5MP and has a very quick response.  It also shoots HD video fluidly enough to share with your social circle without having to apologize for the quality.  The touch screen and buttons also respond in a way that most people would find sufficient.The two biggest complaints I've seen -- speaker quality and internal memory  -- are certainly merited.  However, this is a sub-$200 phone, so not everything is going to be the absolute best.  The speaker will probably be annoyance for anyone who listens to music or uses speakerphone.  It is pretty weak and distorts at higher volumes.  Bluetooth and/or a good pair of headphones can solve that problem easily, however.  The lack of memory (1 GB internal) isn't a huge problem for me personally, but if you're an app-aholic who simply can't let go of your more infrequently used titles, the F3's minimal storage could pose a logistical hurdle.For a phone under $200, the Optimus is definitely a good value.  It has some nice features, like NFC, 4G LTE capability, and Corning Gorilla Glass 2, you wouldn't normally expect in this price tier.  If the speaker was a little better, and it had more internal memory, there's no doubt this phone would be the best value in all of prepaid mobile.  As it is, the F3 certainly deserves the four-star rating I gave it in this review.",4.0,1381190400,"10 8, 2013",LG Optimus F3 (Virgin Mobile),65.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZRuZ6iDgL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 669},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"
B00D9AOU3G,A25JF4201HQEJF,"Mostlee ""Everquest fan""","[0, 0]","I've had this phone since October 2013 and I'm not surprised to see the price drop by 1/2 in that time.  The main thing about this phone (like no other) is battery life.  If I manage to not leave GPS on constantly, I can go a couple days without charging; I usually don't wait that long though.As for apps.  I learned from reading those reviews written by those in the know, NOT to add tons of apps all at once.  There clearly isn't enough internal memory to swat a fly with.  Knowing that, I navigated that obstacle by adding and subtracting apps until I got a good mix.  Then I tried some of them out and got rid of some, added more and learned to use the restart (soft reboot) to clear the way for updating.Yes, it's tedious, but no one has a battery that lasts like mine does, hands down. The only issue that I'm having with the phone is to try to add my playlists (to the memory card).  I didn't like the amount of memory that was being eaten up by the player app, so deleted it.  I prefer how the phone behaves without that type of app.  If I want music, I guess I'll have to get a separate player.I also like that there were otter cases for it right away, so I ordered some.  Recently, I found a pretty good case too that allows for the slimline otter.  I can finally carry it in my pocket.  Not a big fan of the less than solid charger hook up.  A common complaint for cell phones, I guess.  I didn't get this for the camera, but I may as well say, I wish it were better.  It's hard to get a good photo, especially if you are using it to make deposits with other website's programs, if you know what I mean.I think that I'll be using this phone until it dies or they come up with a good HTC that I can afford.  Come on Virgin Mobile!4/7/14 EDIT: I noticed the other day, that Virgin was offering this phone for about 50 bucks and I can see why.  It turns out, in my case, that my music WAS on the memory card. I found this out when my phone crashed, booted back up and told me that the external memory card might be corrupted.  I had to wipe the card, then found out that my tunes were gone from the phone.  What a way to find out. There just is no way to tell the phone to switch content over to the external card (like I had before with my LG Optimus Elite).  Final words: LG really improved battery life, but they took a huge step back on not being able to use the full potential of an external memory card.",3.0,1392940800,"02 21, 2014",LG Optimus F3 (Virgin Mobile),65.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZRuZ6iDgL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 669},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"

B00D9AOU3G,ALHC64J88LVWO,Wayfinder,"[7, 11]","Edited one day later:At first I gave this phone 5 stars.  Having used it I give it about a 3.5-4 stars because the claims and reviews I've read didn't totally pan.  Of course we realize user-experience can differ from person to person.On the whole the LG Optimus F3 appears to work pretty well.  At about $150 (currently) for a duo-core latest-tech phone it's a pretty good deal.  The F3 is thin and light-weight (about 1/2 the weight of my HTC Evo V) which means it's much more comfortable to carry.  It has a very visible decent-size screen (4"").However, there are some minor, itchy little drawbacks.  Prominent is the HOME button, which is an actual requires-pressure pushbutton rather than a touch key.  On the one hand it's not as easy to accidentally hit, which is a plus.  On the other hand, it's not as easy to intentionally press, which is a minus.  Coin toss on that one.The user interface is not as intuitive and user-friendly as I would like.  There's a bunch of stuff at the top of the screen that I'm not used to being on Android... and it seems standard things I use daily that I had to search and find.  Probably a matter of just getting used to it, but minorly annoying since I own 3 other Android devices and they all work similarly to one another.Most annoying was the disappointing battery life.  The phone advertises ""16 hours of talk time"" compared to the standard 7-8 on most phones.  This was difficult to believe since it has a smaller battery than some.  That hard to believe turned out to be true.  I ran some significant and extensive tests (stand-by tests, Netflix tests, screen-always on tests, and an ""overnight see how much battery it retains just sitting there"" test)... and found it was about neck and neck with my EVO-V, which is known to have poor battery life.  In reality, most Android phones I've seen have horrible battery life-- especially if one turns on WiFi or Bluetooth.  This phone discharged from 100% to 75% just sitting idle overnight... same as my HTC.  Thus my primary reason for buying it-- the vaunted huge battery life-- turned out to be groundless hype.Also to be factored in is VM's service.  If you live in an area with good reception, you'll have little problem. If you live on a ""fringe area""... you will grow to hate Virgin Mobile.  Their ""coverage map"" is significantly overrated in quality (as people will verify in hundreds of net reviews).  That's a drawback for all their phones, not just this one, but it does detract from the attraction of the LG Optimus.All that considered, responding to a couple of misconceptions:Several folks have commented on the ""very low memory"" (about 1 gig) and ""can't install apps on the SD card"".The HTC Evo V has the same internal memory... as do a lot of Android phones.  Many Android tablets have only 512 megs or 1 gig of core RAM.  That's nothing unusual.  I've put a ton of apps on my phone and never run out of memory.If one does run out of memory... it may be time to clear out some non-essential apps.  Move high-level games to the SD card (if possible)-- or limit your phone to lower-level games and save the big ones for your tablet or PC.  One shouldn't really run out of memory on a 1 gig phone.  If that happens, you may need to examine app use levels and research how Android handles app storage.  I've included a bit on that below.  In general, a gig should be plenty if you add a microSD card (which is pretty much a given essential these days.  Be sure to use a ""class 10"" card).Some phones have higher internal memory... but they cost a whole lot more (for example the Samsung S3 has 16 gigs, but is $400).  The Apple iPhone has 8 gigs (or more)... but is expensive and can't be expanded.  This phone can take up to a 32 gig chip.Some folks have complained apps can't be placed on the microSD.  That's simply not correct.  Some have claimed LG has crippled the phone.  I've seen no evidence of such.  It uses standard Android 4.1.1 Jellybean... and has a lot less ""garbage"" on the phone than others I've seen.Be aware that with Android, not all apps can be transferred to an SD card; they have to be specifically written to allow transferring.  There are apps on the market specifically designed to let you know whether an app can be transferred or not-- and that perform that transfer if it's possible.  I'd highly recommend buying a 16 or 32 gig mSD card and transferring as many as possible.  I've loaded lots of apps without resorting to the SD card and still had about 1/3 of my RAM free.  Never even came close to filling a gig.The plus of course is an inexpensive full-blown Android phone and plans starting at $35 a month.  I don't think one can buy a better phone for the money, which is why I give it 4 stars.",4.0,1379894400,"09 23, 2013",LG Optimus F3 (Virgin Mobile),65.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZRuZ6iDgL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 669},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"

I'm coming from the HTC One Maxx and the Note 2.  I thought the Maxx was about the best, but I had to return it because I couldn't ""handle"" it.  I kept dropping it or losing it because it was too big to fit in my pocket COMFORTABLY, (and I never like anything in my pockets anyway), and too bulky for a belt holster.  So I carried it in my hand - and broke two screens and lost it the third time.  I switched to the LG G2 and love it!PROS:* It's a good size and feels good in the hand.  I preferred the bigger HTC One Maxx screen for it's size, the front speakers, and Blinkfeed, but the LG G2 for everything else.* The power and volume buttons on the back.  This is AWESOME.  It's just the right place for them.  I wish all manufacturers would do this.  Brilliant!!* Since it doesn't have HTC Blinkfeed, I was able to use my go-to launcher - ADW Launcher EX.  The main thing there is it lets me make the icons bigger and remove the text under the icons, for a much bigger and cleaner look.  All with a button click.* Interface is great.  I love the fact that I can SEE the Back, Home, and Settings soft buttons at the bottom of the screen.  With the HTC, and a lot of phones, you can't see them.  And lots of other features that others have mentioned, really make a big difference in usability.* It allows for INDUCTIVE CHARGING!  No plugging anything in; just sit the phone on the charging ""plate"".  Very convenient.

B00FCMFOFM,A30HYKFL7ERFE7,Matt Turner,"[0, 0]","What I Like:1. The SCREEN - oh my word. It makes my beautiful HTC One's screen look small and dim. This is the best screen I've seen on any smartphone. The thin bezels are...thin.  The resolution is impossibly sharp.  I love, love, LOVE the screen. It's difficult to overstate how awesome it is.  OH MY GOSH IT'S SO AWESOME!2. It's difficult to imagine a much better camera, hardware-wise. The images are perhaps slightly on the cool side for my personal taste (I edit most images anyway), but the resolution is high without graininess, the shutter is fast, and you get very usable images overall.  The camera software is...not my favorite.  See my notes on software later on.3. Snappy. Fast. No lag at all. The processor/RAM combination on this phone will please anyone.  Overall, though, I think that hardware specs are overrated as a way to judge high-end smartphones.  You won't be able to tell a difference between a Snapdragon 600 and a Snapdragon 800, 99.8% of the time.  Don't buy a phone just because of a 0.5 GHz difference in processor speed.4. You will notice the larger battery on this phone.  It outlasts my HTC One by an hour or so overall.  It doesn't charge very fast though.5. Fairly thin profile, on par with other flagship smartphones.6. Good price for a high-end phone.What could go either way:1. Buttons on the back of the phone.  You get used to them quickly, and some people even really like them. Some might hate them.  For me, it wasn't actually a huge deal either way. I think overall, I prefer them on the side, but don't make this a sticking-point.2. I don't know how I managed to scratch this screen in just two weeks of ownership, but I did. In several places. With a case on the phone. Now, this may be me and not the case, but usually I expect a bit more durability. Still, it's Gorilla Glass...so there's that...What I don't like:1. The SOFTWARE skin.  Why, oh why did you butcher Android, LG? Okay, it's not terrible. Just...dinky.  Cheesy.  Overdone. There are a lot of features, but all of them are just a little...too much. Overall, the feel is just cartoony.  Coming from the modern, sleek, understated, and beautiful HTC Sense - and iOS before that - it was just not for me. I'm pretty sure I would have been wholly taken in by this phone if it had stock Android. But the software experience is so much more important than specs and even the screen.  Design is somewhat a subjective thing, but it was more than design. Even ignoring the AT&T; add-ons, there just way too much bloat. Some people may not care as much about software.  But for me, it really was a deal breaker, and I had to trade it in after two weeks.2. Slick, plastic shell materials. It's not that it doesn't feel ""premium"". It's solid enough.  Just not as premium as my HTC One or iPhone. The hardware appearance is just obviously not something they emphasized.Overall:Go try this phone.  Play with it for a long time. Play with the settings, the dialer, the contacts, the email.  Do it all, and if you like the software then get this phone. If you it bothers you even a little, beware - it may drive you mad.  But it's subjective, and you might like it. The screen, battery, and specs are perhaps the best in the market - even 8 months after its launch.

I wrote a lengthy Nexus 7 review before; here is my lengthy Nexus 5 review updated after over a month of straight usage. It should cover the vast majority of topics on the device. Let's get started on what possibly is the best high end phone deal in America.(1) Hardware:Personally, in my opinion, high to medium end devices from reputable brands have reached the point where most people won't be able to tell the difference or the difference won't be something they regularly use. That said, I'm still going to cover it, if you're not interested in the nerd talk about hardware, then all you need to know is that the phone is capable hardware wise for demanding users and honestly overkill for average users. Skip this section of my review and head on down to the camera portion.The device is built on a Qualcomm S800 Pro processor. Clocked at 2.2 GHz quadcore processor, the phone screams on speed. I'm not a fan of mobile benchmarks due to their inherent problems of actually measuring what they claim, but benchmarks all put the Nexus 5 at the moment in the top end of performance. Compared to my Nexus 7's Tegra 3, the Nexus 5 has a fighter jet engine compared to the first generation Nexus 7's turboprop engine.There's also a Hynix 2 GB RAM chip running at DDR3 1600 Mhz, and either a 16 GB or 32 GB Sandisk NAND memory chip depending which model you bought. Google is charging $50 more for the 32 GB device. That's about a 625% markup over wholesale NAND prices. Take that as you will.There are Bluetooth, NFC, GPS and unlike the Nexus 4, a slim-port compatibility, thus letting you connect the phone to a monitor or television screen. LG/Google kept the wireless charging from the Nexus 4, to which the wireless charger has to be purchased separately.The phone comes with an Adreno 330 graphics chip. I'm not a big mobile gamer, but this per the professional reviews and FPS benchmarks will handle every game out for Android. For non-gamers, the Adreno 330 is overkill.Microphone and talk clarity are on par with Nexus 4, meaning fine. Speaker seems to have more noise at higher volumes. Also, speaker is mono despite there being two grills at the bottom. One grill is for the microphone.Connects via standard USB, where the device itself has a microUSB connection. Plugging the device into your computer brings it up as another removable storage device where you can simply drop and drag files into folders. Easy file movement plus standard USB makes the device very simple to use and standard charging conventions make it easy to find chargers around your house and office. Sometimes the device goes wonky on USB connection (was a Nexus 4 issue as well), so just go into settings and storage, click on the settings (3 vertical boxes) and change the connection to PTP or MPT and the phone will reappear properly.Like all recent Nexus devices, no MicroSD slot and no removable battery. MicroSD slot is partially alleviated now that USB OTG works. See my ""other"" section for more details.You can find these specific parts on iFixit's tear down which gave it a solid 8/10 for user repair. For the low price of $349/$399, there is no other phone with this quality hardware that for the price.Right now, due to shortages in supply, many people are scalping the phones for profit. If you can wait, the phone will ship between 2 and 4 weeks and if the Nexus 4 timeline tells us anything, quickly reach the point where it's under a week. My phone took a little under 3 weeks to deliver from ordering it on the 1st of November.(2) Camera:The back camera is still an 8 megapixel and front is 1.3 megapixel, same as the Nexus 4. Low light has improved considerable and HDR+ alleviates many of lighting problems. HDR is a software/hardware combination that takes three photos, one underexposed, one overexposed and one regular and the software combines them to even out the lighting issues to produce the best possible shot. Graininess has been reduced as well. Google keeps the same minimal interface for the camera with the select and drag method for changing options.Image stabilization is so-so and the camera can be slow to focus at times. The Nexus 5 camera is an improvement over the Nexus 4, but a Lumia this is not.  Google released updates to the Android OS that had specific Nexus 5 camera fixes. The camera's improved, but it's still relatively slow at focusing. However, image quality has improved considerably as have night shots. The only real criticism now is that the camera is slow to focus.(3) Android 4.4 - Operating System:Google's latest and greatest is on display here. Android 4.4, otherwise known as Kitkat comes pre-installed on the phone. There are some changes from Android 4.3 Jelly bean. Like all Nexus devices, operating system updates are done over the air via Google. No waiting on device manufacturers or carriers.The launcher has changed and on the Nexus 5 (and it's exclusive to the Nexus 5), and widgets are now removed from the app screen and are accessed by pressing and holding down on a home screen.Icon sizes have been enlarged in the app library, and formatting has been tweaked.Android Run Time (ART) is now available as opposed to the stock Google Dalvik compiler. Allegedly, ART nets a handful more hours out of the device per some reviews, but I haven't noticed any difference. In theory, ART should speed up the device, but with the S800 Pro already blazing fast, it's questionable if anyone will notice, your mileage will vary. Also, some apps are broken under ART.Google has prominently placed Google search on the top of the phone and included the new function of simply talking to your phone to have it fulfill requests. Simply say ""Ok Google"" and the Google Now function loads up where you can ask questions or request information simply by talking to it. Phone has to be unlocked for it to work as opposed to the Moto X which I believe will work without unlocking.Hangouts has merged with text messaging for a combined app. As with all Android phones, you can download another app and make it your default over Hangouts. Currently the Hangouts change in my opinion was a mistake. Group texting via SMS has problems with sending, the app prioritizes sending to Gmail accounts over SMS and you can't mix SMS and Gmail group chats together. The separation in 4.3 was a better system.Google kept the Sywpe like typing option on its default keyboard (drag your fingers between keys rather than typing) and notification center appears to be the same from 4.3. Colors however for notification went from blue to white. Also the notification flashing light is still there from the Nexus 4. It's sort of like the Blackberry's red flashing LED, but at the bottom.Outside of the changes from 4.3, stock Android 4.3, stock meaning there's no ""skin"" over it such as Touchwiz or HTC's Sensation, runs extremely fast. Apps load instantly, everything is extremely responsive. This is not Android Honeycomb that was an unresponsive lag filled mess. It is however, less intuitive than iOS 6/7. Android verse Apple has always been like this and its personal preference. That said, if you're in to nearly complete customization, widgets, lock screen information and generally busting out of a walled garden to have your phone do what you want it to do, this is your cup of tea.(4) Battery Life:The battery life on the Nexus 5 is better than the Nexus 4. A slight boost of 200 mAh to 2,300 from 2,100 mAh is minor and it appears the gains are from the operating system primarily. Some user are reporting with ART, they can last a full day as opposed to 16 to 17 hours on Dalvik, some users are reporting the same battery life.After more than a month of the usage on the device, I find that battery life is generally superior to the Nexus 4 and going a whole day is not a problem. This isn't a Note 3 that will last all day gaming. Mileage will vary depending on your behavior.The biggest killer of battery aside from constant gaming is using LTE in an area with weak LTE signal. The phone (like all phones) will eat up huge amounts of battery trying to maintain the bad signal. Sometimes it will drain 20% of my battery in an hour or two on standby. Switching to 3G as the primary network reduces standby usage to a few percent over two or three hours.(5) Build & Looks:The phone comes in two colors, black and white. Note that the white version does not extend the white to the front; it's just the back panel.The phone is fairly light and considerably lighter than the Nexus 4. It is still a black rectangle like most smartphones. LG/Google have forgone the glass backing from the Nexus 4. This should significantly reduce real damage as the soft plastic backing is far less susceptible to shattering like glass. The phone is a bit thinner than the Nexus 4.Screen is 4.95 inches, with confirmed Gorilla Glass 3. The phone is using IPS which gives better clarity and color than the Nexus 4. Resolution is set at 1,920-by-1,080 pixel for a 445 pixel density (PPI). I'd still use a screen guard as the face drop test reveals that Gorilla Glass 3 is good for preventing scratches, but so-so to horrendously bad on impact resistance.Side bezels are very minimal, but the top and bottom bezels are still large. Overall, it's not going to wow people upon first look, but most of us are here for performance and pure Android, what excites us is not how a phone looks, but what we can do with it.(6) LTE & Carrier Support:Google is selling these phones completely unlocked, meaning that you can go to any carrier that supports its bands and it should work.Unlike the Nexus 4, the Nexus 5 is LTE enabled. This was a huge reason for me to get the Nexus 5 as I'm paying for T-Mobile's LTE on the simple plan but I wasn't able to access it. My local HSPA+ was topping out around 11 Mbp/s in the heart of Honolulu to a paltry 4 Mbp/s in my house away from the heart of the city. LTE has pushed urban speed to over 30 Mbp/s (per my last test) and my house to over 9 Mbp/s. Your mileage will of course vary.Nexus 5's LTE will work with bands on T-Mobile, Sprint and AT&T.; Verizon has some LTE bands that the Nexus 5 doesn't support and Verizon and Google have some ideological issues that are preventing them from working together on the Nexus line. T-Mobile is selling the device non-subsidized at a $100 markup financed over 24 months at 0%. Sprint is selling the phone subsidized at $49 but you'll pay it all back and more through subsidy recovery fees built into the monthly bill. AT&T; isn't selling the device but will support BOYD Nexus 5. Be aware though, unless you're on AT&T;'s prepaid Aio service, you're still going to be paying for subsidy recovery fees even though you didn't get a subsidy from AT&T.;A lot of people don't seem to understand that the amount they pay for the phone on day one, usually $199 is not the total price they pay for the phone. That's the down payment. AT&T;/Sprint/Verizon and previously T-Mobile recover their subsidy via the fees they charge in their monthly. T-Mobile and other non-contract carriers have broken out of this model and give a dosage of transparency to monthly billings as to what is service fee and what is subsidy recovery. If you buy an unlocked phone from Google and take it to T-Mobile, you will not be charged a device fee. If you take it to Verizon/AT&T;/Sprint outside of their prepaid options, you will be charged a device fee even though you did not get a subsidy. This will vastly increase the total price you pay for your phone. Keep that in mind.The best deal for this phone if you don't talk much is T-Mobile's $30 a month plan for 100 minutes, unlimited text and 5 GB of LTE, unlimited 3G. Download Google Voice for data calling if you need more talk time. For two years of service, that's $1,069 in total monthly and phone bills. That's less than the cost of 10 months of Verizon.If you're looking at other plans, Apple has done an extremely fantastic job of comparing AT&T;, Sprint, Verizon and T-Mobile's myriad plans into a single nice webpage. Google ""iPhone Plans Comparison"" for the best simple comparison of American big carrier plans. Apple labels these ""iPhone Plans"" but they are generic smartphone plans that anyone on any compatible device can purchase.(7) Other:Unlike the Nexus 4, USB Hosting OTG works. I personally don't find this that important, considering that OTG is a hassle on a device that's constantly on the move, but it is a big change from the Nexus 4 which didn't apply sufficient voltage to power USB Hosting. If you're wondering what USB Hosting/OTG is, USB Hosting and ""On The Go"" lets a phone or tablet to plug in a USB device in and let the device via the right program access the storage on the USB device. I'm currently using the Nexus Media Importer (as I previously bought that for the Nexus 7) as it lets me do this without rooting. I was never a big memory user on my Nexus 4, but I know some people are. Google ""Meenova"" for a more compact design that will let you access MicroSD cards on your Nexus 5. See my picture in the photo gallery.When I first started the phone up, Google play strangely tried to download and install every app I'd previous bought. What gives? I had to manually stop the install of certain apps.Sound quality via headphones is solid, but depends also on the quality of your headphones/earphones. Sound on the speaker is relatively low.Rooting is available now and there are a few ROMs for the Nexus 5 if you wish to play around.Accessories are flooding Amazon as well as eBay for relatively affordable prices. I'm using the[AIR CUSHION] Spigen Google Nexus 5 Case ULTRA HYBRID [Black] [1 FREE Premium Japanese Screen Protector + 2 FREE Graphics] Anti-Scratch Bumper Case with Clear Back Panel for Nexus 5 - ECO-Friendly Package - Black (SGP10609), but I'm not entirely happy as the flush buttons make it hard to use one handed as opposed to myRINGKE FUSION for Google Nexus 4 Best Selling Shock Absorption Bumper + Anti Scratch Clear Back Premium Hybrid Case [Eco/DIY Pkg.][BLACK].Personally, I do love Android. I can simply turn my phone on, look at my lock screen at the Dashclock Widget and see how many texts I have, emails, weather notifications Facebook notifications and so on without having to unlock my phone. I can also turn on GPS, silence my phone, the flash light on and other functions from my lock screen too. The Nexus 5 gives me a great affordable option.(8) Conclusion:The Nexus 5 has some drawbacks, adequate camera, no MicroSD slot, no removable battery and lacking some of Verizon's LTE bands. It does provide a blazing fast processor, roaring graphics chip, an extremely stock version of Android, thin and light design for a very affordable unlocked price. And it's Sprint capable. Android does take some time to learn, but it offers nearly complete customization. For $349 and a dose of willingness to learn, you can't go wrong here.TLDR: Blazing fast smartphone, okay camera, no bloatware, no Verizon, unlocked and just $349~399.",4.0,1384819200,"11 19, 2013",LG Google Nexus 5 D820 32GB Unlocked GSM Android Cell Phone - White,429.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51qBfIpvolL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 10805},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

B00GD9R7BC,A3KKA2GYA0J7LB,Morphling,"[0, 0]","The Nexus 5 is the best Nexus yet and one of the best phones at that. I've had mine for approximately a week and couldn't be happier. I got the white one and think it looks fantastic. With that note, let's get into a review and we'll start on build quality:The build - the phone is solidly built and light too - I personally like a heaver phone being a man with larger hands. So, if you like lighter phones and find others too bulky, this may be refreshing for you. Some professional reviews state the phone is good or mediocre build at best which is patently false. Yes, there's a seam on this phone, especially owning a white version but it isn't some huge gap that's ugly or a place where you can push the two pieces together more. The phone has no creaks at all and the glass is flush on all sides. I mention the glass because I've owned Motorola, HTC, and even iPhones where the glass at the edge isn't even across the whole device and it drives me nuts. The new buttons are ceramic - ohhh! They are nice and work well. The sim card tray is next to the power button but I haven't noticed it at all searching for the button as it's very flush with the phone. There isn't an SD card slot on this phone - get over it. 32GB is enough for MOST users. If you are truly a power user who needs to swap out 64GB cards frequently for whatever reasons (I know some of you do exist) this isn't the phone for you. I'm sorry, the Nexus devices haven't had one in a long time and it's a cost saving measure too.Next is connectivity and calling - the main point of a phone, right? I won't discuss specific networks as that opens up a whole different debate that entire forums can't solve! LTE works screaming fast on the phone and it holds onto the signal well. HSPA+ is a beast on this phone too if your area doesn't have it. Calls connect well and nothing has dropped so far. The call quality is decent, which is a bummer as I'm one who still talks a lot on their phone. I haven't tried any HD voice features yet so that may help the issue. Wifi works well on the phone too both with 5ghz and 2.4ghz - my older router doesn't have all the latest standards but the phone supports any wifi you'll encounter. I'll point out that my house is an old one with huge blocks that love to cancel out any cell signals. This phone holds onto them and keeps them unlike other phones I've used on the same network.Screen - The best I've used. I have grown tired of the Samsung AMOLED screens and favor the route Apple and HTC and now LG have taken, for the most part. It's super crystal clear and even being a near-sighted blind person, I can't pick out pixels for the first time. Colors are pretty accurate and everything is great looking. The touch portion of the screen is great too with no issues. It works as well as any other top tier phone. Now 'for the most part' means I do notice this screen, as any LCD, cannot do true black unlike AMOLED. It's a feature left to that technology alone but it doesn't detract here as the screen is great and you don't notice unless you have a competing phone next to it.Battery - It's average on this phone. It isn't a beast like I've had on some Moto phones but it isn't a junker like some Samsung devices I've used too. After the first couple days, it evened out and with moderate use I can make it to 10pm bed-time. It isn't going to blow you away but it isn't the worst out there either. I'd have liked an option to use a removable battery as I don't mind a heavier device or battery - but clearly we are going to wafer light and thin devices.Camera - It's a good camera to me and leaps and bounds better than any past phone I've owned including other Nexus devices. Pictures come out clear and the HDR+ feature is pretty good as well. Pictures come out sharper and it even works well trying to take a picture of my moving baby. I can still tell it was taken with a phone vs. a stand-alone camera, but it's way more sufficient for my wants than I need. The wife takes the serious pictures, I just take pictures of things to make sure I bought the right item. So, if you aren't a budding photographer, this thing works well and even captures moving people well enough.Software - The new KitKat 4.4 is here and overall I love it more than the last version, just like I do with every android release. I won't give a comprehensive review of the OS here, but I'll touch on some things. Google added some developer options on this phone that you can enable as an option that make it scream. It moves faster than I can use it now and this is a great step for any phone OS. I've used Windows Phone 8 and many flavors of iOS and many versions of Android. This is by far my favorite OS now, hands down. MS has done well with 8, but this blows that out of the water now. iOS 7 has veered off to me and I personally don't like it. Anyway, this thing is fast! Google now is better than ever, but I had to turn it off as it sucked battery down. I hope Google addresses this as the service is awesome. Hangouts is cool that everything is in one spot, but it's clunky to use for SMS and everything. I wish google would have waited until everything in hangouts was totally done before merging, but they at least give you the option to download another SMS program and set it as the default now. You have got to love choices. Default email is better now and Gmail and calendar are excellent as ever. Overall it's a pleasant step forward and hardly anything I don't like.That's a basic review of the phone and I'll end with the overall value and point of the phone. Here on this great online retailer, the phone appears to cost more. You can easily go to the source, if available in your country, and purchase it for an incredibly great price. It is completely unlocked so you don't have to fiddle with buying an unlock code, which in the USA is now shady anyway, and waste more time and money. This phone also will get updates quickly without hassles or being left in the dust instantly. It's also priced at a mid-tier value, for almost all top tier specs and experiences. I think many pro-reviewers have worried that things like the camera or battery aren't toe to toe with other phones, but those do cost more. The bigger issue they miss is Android on this phone is unlike it on any other phone. That's worth something too and what I stress is the most important thing about this phone.",5.0,1385078400,"11 22, 2013",LG Google Nexus 5 D820 32GB Unlocked GSM Android Cell Phone - White,429.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51qBfIpvolL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 10805},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

Even though the cab was super noisy and could barely hear the truck radio, the person I called could hear me clearly and I had no problem hearing them.  The earbuds do a nice job of blocking out sound.  The person on the other end of the call heard very little of the cab noise (normally they can barely hear me).  Sound quality while streaming slacker radio and play music through my phone was clear, but lacking bass.  Streaming the same apps through my tablet have excellent bass (think it's time for a new phone. ;).  I did not recharge the headset before my trip, but after using the headset all day long and the hour or two last night, I'm still at medium charge.  I was streaming music the whole trip and made/received 15 or so phone calls.The only tests left for me are durability and longevity.  But as of right now I am very happy with my purchase.if you want different colors, Verizon sells a red/black model and a white, best buy sells a blue/black model (Verizon also has a sale on these at the moment).

There is very noticeable lag when watching Netflix videos.I can walk two rooms away from my phone as retain signal as long as I face the  left side of my head toward where the phone is sitting, if I face the right side to the phone/tablet the signal starts cutting out...I made a test call to my wife, she could hear me fine, sound quality wasn't too different than using my phones mic.  Haven't tried calling from a moving car yet though.I did experience some odd cutting out while sitting with my phone next to me a couple times.  Also these are very loud while using them with my phone, I have the volume set to the lowest setting and they are still borderline too loud while playing music.  The volume works fine with my tablet though.For the price I feel the range should be longer or there should be a receiver on each side of the headset.

I see a lot of complaints about the HBS-750 button location, but as someone that play golf with this thing around my neck, I have to tell you this is a way better location for the buttons. (No accidental presses anymore.)I also don't understand the complaints of low volume - It almost blew my eardrums when I first played a song(OK, not really, but it is pretty loud). Maybe look at the equilizer settings?(hold in both volume down and volume up while playing a song)The headset has great tone range and good bass.

B00JCKS1C8,A1X5HOPOPAL9FR,Kindle Customer,"[2, 2]","Quick review.Used the last versions of these. If you've played around with the HBS line then you already know the joy of not getting tangled up in cables. Here are the pros I've found with the HBS-750:The slanted design keeps the headset resting on your neck better so less adjusting and bouncing around when cycling or running.The sound is amazing and noticeable between even the last HBS-730 version.Battery life is equal to previous versions. (I haven't bought the active noise canceling HBS-800 version to test yet)Love the app (Android tested) BT Reader giving me text messages without having to check my phone. Although jury is still out whether it remains cool or just more of a gimmick.No small matter about the wire clips. Much more rugged. I was using black twist-ties or just knotting the wires to keep them up. These are much improved.Blue LED indicator under control. Most annoying part of the previous HBS was that flashing super bright LED right on your neck. Now with it softer and on the side I'll no longer have to give strangers at airports who stare that apologetic smile.Finally the price point is unbeatable. The fact that I am balking at spending $100 bucks for active noise canceling tells you that the HBS-750 is a great deal for half that. Any other headset would easily be double.Topics that I found are negligible:Button placement: the buttons moved to the sides are no more of a learning curve than when I first got a pair of HBS-700s.Magnets to hold the ear buds on the underside are fine. I can find them fine. They work.Bluetooth dropping/call quality. While this is a major issue my 1st hand experience is that the HBS-750 is far better than the HBS-730s (of which I had two) was noticeable bad. Maybe they tweaked antenna placement in this version or maybe I just got lucky. (see below)Including a charger or not shouldn't effect your buying choice at this point. Honestly these using micro-usb you may find you already have a million of these in drawers around the house already. If not they're a couple bucks cheap. More importantly any standard 5 volt usb charger will recharge these in an hour. Less if you use 2 amp tablet/ipad usb chargers.RETURN LEMONS:Last little note for all the 1 stars out there. Yes it stinks when you get a bad piece of gear. I've been there. Return it. Pay the amazon shipping, go to the store, tell them your tale of woe and return it. Make LG ultimately eat the cost of replacing a bad headset because the alternative of paying for a device and NOT returning it means at best LG just made a sale and any issues such as the mic not working with wifi won't get fixed.Last last little note: I couldn't replicate the reported issue with the call mic dropping even after switching to 2.4Ghz on my phone and blasting wifi (up/down) while streaming audio or on a call. Nor could I get my phone to jitter or skip while on a call or streaming putting my phone in my back pocket (an act that guaranteed skipping on my HBS-730).

The problem is; when talking on Samsung Galaxy S5 via LG Tone Bluetooth headset at some random point in the conversation the microphone stops, but the earbuds are still working. I can hear, but I can't be heard. I can take the phone off headset selection, and then put it back on headset selection, and that makes it work, again, for a short while, then it happens, again. I lost the mic 5x in a 30 minute conversation. It is an intermittent problem. A Verizon tech did a factory reset on my phone when I took the first one back. I have also done a soft reset, and LG tech had me do a reboot on the headset. The problem persists. I have been in touch with LG and Verizon. The general consensus is there is a glitch in the headset software, but LG says it is not their problem. If it were not for this problem I would be absolutely thrilled with the LG Tone HBS-750 Blue tooth headset.Further research on Google shows that I am not the only one having this issue. But there also seems to be a solution, albeit not a great solution, but one none the less. This issue of the mic going to mute can be stopped by turning off the wifi on the phone. Unfortunately, I use wifi at home, and this is be a huge inconvenience, but it works.The most frustrating part of this is that I have contacted LG both via phone and chat, and both times they claim complete ignorance of the problem. I have even directed them to the forums where the issue is being debated/complained about. They, LG, simply do the ostrich dance, sticking their heads in the sand and saying it doesn't exist. A couple of customers actually put comments on the LG forum and LG took them down stating &#34;your review did not meet our guidelines for posting on our site.&#34; I guess that means that LG only accepts positive reviews.Don't get me wrong, this is a wonderful headset. The best I have ever owned. WHEN IT WORKS!!! But it is very frustrating to be talking on the phone and have your mic go mute all of a sudden. Or having to turn off wifi so that you can talk without being cut off.If you do buy the LG TONE HBS750, just be aware of the issue and the fact that LG is not going to acknowledge that there is an issue.",1.0,1402531200,"06 12, 2014",LG TonePRO Wireless Stereo Headset HBS-750 Bluetooth,52.97,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZwLQDhQsL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 346},LG,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Bluetooth Headsets']]"
