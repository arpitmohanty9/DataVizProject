It's bad enough that the E71 has a 2.5mm headphone jack vs. the standard 3.5mm jack found on 99% of the electronic devices in the US, but for some reason, the E71x sold in US by AT&T; has a different configuration on the earphone port than the unlocked version of the E71 I bought on Amazon.If you have the non-AT&T; version of this phone, you will need a different adapter --> the AD-50 (has 2 plastic rings) instead of this AD-61 (has 3 plastic rings). I had the same experience as others here getting only one channel to work on the headphones when using this device (and I bought another item at Radio Shack with same results).  Of course, you will lose the functionality of the built in microphone that came with the hands-free wired setup, but at least, you will be able to choose from hundreds of earphones and enjoy much better sound than with those junk earphones that came with the phone!

The positives are as follows:(1) All the controls (volume, track skip, start-stop and call answer) work well with my C6-01.(2) It is quite comfortable for an earbud type set axnd fits well (there are a total of three pair of replaceable earpieces that are included so most people should find one that fits).(3) The volume level is acceptable and the flat cords don't seem to tangle as easily as regular cords.(4) It provides a fair amount of isolation from ambient noise.The main negative is that unlike the description on Nokia's site these don't come with a 2.5 adapter, which would have been nice since I also have an old Nokia E71.  In all fairness the seller did not say that they were included and since these are wrapped in a small baggie they are obviously not the same package as the 701s sold directly from Nokia, which do include the adapter.  Although they seem to be working well now, the build quality seems a bit weak and based on prior reviews it will be interesting to see how long these last.All in all for the price it is a fair deal.  I wish I could find something like the OEM headsets from my old xPress Music 5800.  Besides having much better build quality, the headset allowed you to unplug the included earpiece part of it and substitute any headset you wanted with a 3.5 inch jack; however, it would not control the tracks or volume of the C6-01.",3.0,1324339200,"12 20, 2011",Original Nokia Stereo Headset WH-701 WH701 3.5mm AV Connector,10.59,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31Q6wGlVsHL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 48418},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Headsets', 'Wired Headsets']]"

B003V4AJSU,AEQYAG42F9128,BobL,"[1, 1]","I have had one of these exact phones for over 2 years and I'm very happy with it. My wife wanted a new phone to replace her old Motorola flip phone, and I asked her if she'd like to get one like mine. I use Consumer Cellular as my provider, and bought mine from them originally, but they no longer offer this phone, the Nokia C3-00. I tried buying her a Samsung smartphone, but it sucked the battery down in less than 2 days even with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Maps, etc. and other power hungry functions turned off. Also the Smartphone for some reason started using up my very limited data allowance I have with Consumer Cellular. I saw the Nokia C3-00 offered by Amazon as a brand new, unlocked phone for 110 bucks, so I jumped on it. When it arrived, I charged up the battery, put the SIM card in from my wife's other phone, and there it was. The greatest things about this phone are its simplicity and battery life. After charging my own C3-00, I usually get 8 days out of it with moderate use before the battery indicator goes from 4 bars to 3 bars, but I charge it again at 3 bars. The voice clarity is great too. Texting is fairly easy as it does have a QWERTY keyboard with alpha numeric and symbols. We are not big &#34;texters&#34; by any means, and I'm not sure if a &#34;power texter&#34; would like this, but maybe they would. It gets the job done. I did check the warranty status of the phone on Nokia's website, and the serial number came up as &#34;out of US warranty&#34;, but emails back and forth from Amazon customer service says that my Amazon invoice as buying this as a new phone here in the US would cover it as being under warranty. I hope to never have to find out. The phone is brand new; it's just that these phones were produced and sold mainly in 2010 and 2011 I think. I guess this is what they may call &#34;old new stock&#34;?The firmware version of mine and my wife's phone is 3.65, and Nokia's OVI software suite when connected to the phone, says there is no newer version available for the phone. One more thing: both our phones have no obvious Wi-Fi connection choice under &#34;Settings/Connectivity&#34; menus. Love the phone anyway for the pluses I mentioned, and for me, there really are no negatives at all. It has all the features mentioned in Amazon's specs, but for email, I really do not remember seeing a &#34;dedicated email&#34; key, but email is doable under messages where you write a message, and then chose &#34;mail&#34; instead of &#34;number for the intended recipient.

The C3 in particular has been my favorite. I realized after trying everything that all I really needed was a basic phone to make calls, send texts, and that would not be an energy hog requiring additional chargers in the car, office, home, etc. I also needed the flexibility to roam internationally and thus needed a multi-band GSM phone.Pros:Excellent battery life;Screen easy to read, large/vibrant for a basic phone;Full keyboard with raised buttons that illuminate;2.0 MP camera;FM radio;Great call quality and signal strength;Multi-band and unlocked for international roaming;STURDY, metallic back, heavy, no need for a case or protective cover;Wifi (not the fanciest web browser or at all comparable to a smartphone but it does work in a pinch).Cons:Limited choice of ringtones/themes/wallpapers;The speaker on the phone is quite sensitive, and many people whom I speak with say that my phone picks up all background noises and amplifies them;Software bugs--the ""conversation view"" of text messaging, while in theory is a cool feature, does not work properly despite software updates. The messages themselves are linked to the wrong sender. Avoid using this feature and just read messages from your inbox or sent box.And that's pretty much all I can think of! For $100 you can get a brand new, high-quality phone that is great for even heavy texters, and no need to spring the additional $20-30 a month on a data plan. **Note: The only thing that may present a problem is that because this phone is unlocked, you will need to sort out your data/MMS/internet settings with your carrier.

B003V4AJSU,ALL4ZW7TOFXNN,"P. Redman ""American Patriot""","[32, 33]","This is a great product.  It's small, but feels solid in your hand.  Has a GREAT battery.  I text a lot and I was used to having to charge my battery daily.  With this phone, the battery lasts AT LEAST two days, and that's with heavy texting and limited internet usage.  Well constructed.  Shows conversational style text.  You can attach ringtones and photos to your contacts.  You can set up recurring appointments. It has an alarm which works really well. You can use up to an 8GB micro SD card with it.  If you have AT&T; service (which I do) you need to know how to configure it so that you can receive multimedia (picture) messages and access the internet. I have the instructions for the configuration, which I will enter below.  I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants a good phone, but doesn't want to pay for a 'smart phone'. You can get unlimited data (internet) usage for $10/month (again, AT&T;) versus $25/month for what they consider to be a 'smart phone'.  Okay, it isn't blazing fast on the internet (uses Edge rather than 3G or 4G), but it's fast enough for me.  I don't actually use it for the internet a lot because I prefer to use my computer for that.  Multimedia messaging works great. It does everything I want it to do and I've been used to using the Samsung Blackjack II and Jack. I've been a cell phone user since 1995.  Again, I highly recommend this product.

B003ZX7RL4,A3G5MOHY1U635N,"A-mazon Customer ""SPB-RU""","[4, 4]","I have the phone for 6 months and I like it in general. I am on T-Mobile unlimited talk, text, data (2GB at 4G speeds then throttled) plan. N8 is not 4G but it is fast enough for what I use it for.Camera takes very good pictures in well lit conditions, but quite poor in low light ones.The stand alone GPS is a great feature and works well. I tried it both in offline and in online mode and it was good for my needs, although in the online mode the GPS locks on your location faster thanks to A-GPS and is quite a bit better at finding businesses by name. However, occasionally GPS gives strange directions that take me off the freeway and re-route me on surface streets to another freeway rather than using the interchange. It is set on the fastest route, but I don't think sometimes it selects the one.The phone has a good range of customizations and settings. The interface is quite intuitive, but you need to take some time to familiarize yourself with the menus. I think that the recent update to Belle made the phone significantly better. I have an Android tablet, so, in comparison, I was not impressed with S^3 and Anna, but Belle finally seems to provide the user experience other Operating Systems have offered for a long time.I use Swype 2.0 from betalabs dot nokia dot com. It supports Russian and other languages that the current release available at the Nokia Store does not. I use Opera Mobile for the web browser and like it better than the Nokia's one. For the book reader I use ZX Reader 2.  Initially, I used Foliantas my ereader, I liked the interface, but then noticed that on some books it occasionally did not break pages correctly (pages would repeat) and also I had to specify encoding of the TXT file, ZX Reader handles pages right and the file encoding is determined automatically.I am disappointed with the selection of the free games on Nokia Store. With Android (particularly Amazon's free app a day promo) I have hundreds of games, but with Nokia most games are demo versions or add supported and won't run without an internet connection.Also with Nokia if you get a free app and need to re-download it later, it may not be available for free anymore (Nokia support confirmed that this was the case), while with Amazon's Android Store re-downloads of the apps you own are free.Coming from BlackBerry handsets I was surprised that ""vibrate then ring"" was not an option for Nokia.  In the office I do not want my phone to ring and I do not want to remember to change profiles, so BlackBerry's ""vibrate then ring"" worked swimmingly for me, but N8 rings immediately when a call, a message or a calendar notification come in.  The best way to mediate this was to select the ascending ring type, but this is still not what I wanted.  Nokia has an app called  Nokia Situations that is supposed to switch profiles automatically depending on the ambiant noise I guess.  I tried this app and I have never seen my profile change from Normal (I carry my phone in the front pocket of my pants).There is a bug with the battery status on the home screen.  It jumps from full to 35% when I set the power saver mode to kick in with no indication of charge levels in between.  I installed Nokia Battery monitor and it seems to track the charge level more accurately, but it is so weird when the battery icon on the home screen looks 100% full and the Nokia Battery Monitor show 70% charge.  I hoped Belle update would fix this, but it did not.  This is the first phone I have that cannot display the battery charge level that makes sense.With N8 I have a 'loss of communication' problem with bluetooth headsets.  I have necer had this problem with any other phone. I tried different headsets (Discovery 975, Jabra Extreme, Jabra EasyGo) and they all have the problem, so it must be the phone. Basically, the phone stops responding to button presses from the headset and the audio is not routed to headset if you answer from the phone. Once the phone is rebooted, the problem goes away. This is pretty annoying because sometimes I am unable to answer a call when I am driving.The most disappointing part of the experience is Nokia's customer support. I had to contact them a few times over the last year, and every time there were issues. The support is offshore, so there is a language barrier combined with the usual ""reading of the support scripts without trying to understand the problem"", constant apologizing and no resolution. The tech support was not knowledgeable, did not follow through with the resolution, I ended up solving the problem myself by reading many forums.Nokia's update to Belle went well for my N8 but caused a ""security code"" error for my wife's C6-01. Apparently, according to Nokia blogs, this was an issue for many people, including some with N8. I found only one reply from Nokia's moderator in one of the blogs suggesting to keep entering any code for an unknown number of times until the phone stops asking for it. I thought this was a very unprofessional reply because first, the error should have not happened during the update, second, the solution should have been more elegant than asking users to enter random numbers hoping that one of them will eventually work (some users reported 30+ tries with no resolution), and third, what is the purpose of the security code if it can be overridden by entering incorrect codes? The solution that finally worked for me was very ""dumb"". No offence to the person who came up with it, but there should be no logical reason why this solution should have worked at all.Anyway, I bought the phone for the camera, GPS, and because I did not want to extend the contract with T-Mobile.  My memories of Nokia handsets from the 90's made me believe that Nokia N8 would be a great choice.  Unfortunately, after experiencing the modern ""Nokia"" I doubt I will buy Nokia again, especially now when they switched to Windows.  With Nokia's last year's FlipSwap promos (terribly executed with rebate amounts for the same phone changing daily, and of course I jumped on the first lower rebate one) I got a good deal on my N8 ad my wife's C6-01.  Considering phones out there, I do not think N8 is worth anywhere near 400 bucks.  I believe, under $200 would be a good deal, but even then, I'd look at other options first.",3.0,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",Nokia N8 Unlocked GSM Touchscreen Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation and 12 MP Camera (Gray),189.98,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tV6EaGsXL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 11706},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

My N95 it just worked, now with the N8 I have to jump through a few hoops to make it work and give a copy to the OVI cloud.

B003ZX7RL4,A2S0T4PXPLQ537,beelzebub,"[4, 4]","2012 UPDATE: Have now had the phone over a year & do not regret the purchase at all.  The Symbian Anna/Belle updates fixed the purple screen issue.  The N8 still works great: long battery life, good reception, excellent camera ... the only downside is that with Symbian on death row for 2016, the # of new apps are dwindling, so if having the latest is an issue for you, you may want to pass.  On the flip side, the price is now $100 less that what I paid making this an incredible deal for those who do not want to pay for a data plan.  The cheapest one is $20/mo so when the 2 year contract is up, you have pretty much made the $ back on the cost of phone.  Now that Nokia is switching over to Windows, which US carriers can detect & force you into a data plan, I would not hesitate to buy this phone if wifi is all you need.I have now had the phone all of 3 days when I noticed that I have the purple screen/tint issue that people have been complaining about since the N8's launch (search the web for details).  It was most notable on the unlock screen - half the clock was purple while the other half was black.  Altho the clock on the screensaver does not have this issue.Amazon's Help Section was anything but, as their directions on how to EXCHANGE sends you to the RETURN section, where exchanges are not an option.  I called & Amazon will be sending a replacement; the good news is, I do not have to return my phone immediately.  I can wait till the new N8 arrives, that way I am not phoneless.Otherwise, the N8 is great; I intended to use it more before I wrote a review but wanted to warn people that the purple issue still exists before they buy.  Some quick points: the Symbian OS is like the step-child of the mobile world but for me, & I suspect many, it works & does what it needs to do.  The build quality is superb & the phone is slimmer than I thought it would be.  So far no problems w/ the phone rebooting randomly (another common complaint).  Battery life is excellent.The reason I got this phone is bc I did not want to be forced into a data plan & so far this phone has worked great on just wi-fi.  Keep in mind that Nokia just said that they will soon stop selling unlocked phones so anyone else wanting to not be trapped into a data plan may want to buy soon.Hopefully the next phone has no issues & ships w/ Symbian Anna & not ^3 (crosses fingers). Then I will write another review or update this one w/ more details ...UPDATE: Just got the replacement phone & still the purple screen issue.  Grrrr ... !Amazon will not exchange the phone twice, they are now only offering a refund.  They got a Nokia rep on the phone with us who offered to have it fixed under warranty but that would leave me phoneless in the week or so that would take.  Neither is exactly an ideal situation (I would like to keep exchanging this brand new expensive phone until I got one that worked properly) but to Amazon's credit, they did put ""Item Under Review"" on the dark gray N8 & are not selling it at all until they have a look at it ...UPDATE 2: 6 months later & now on the Belle OS update.  The phone works just fine - does what it supposed to do.  The Anna update took away the purple tint & it is still gone.  AT&T; still has not forced me into a data plan. Do not regret purchasing this phone & recommend to anyone looking for a basic smartphone or dares to be different, especially now that it is $60 less than what I paid.",5.0,1313539200,"08 17, 2011",Nokia N8 Unlocked GSM Touchscreen Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation and 12 MP Camera (Gray),189.98,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tV6EaGsXL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 11706},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"
B003ZX7RL4,A308QQBOY5CD9C,"Bob Clark ""Frustrated gadgeteer""","[5, 5]","This is a device that requires a lot of time and energy to master. However, if your requirement is to have the capability to capture high quality images for a modest price then the Nokia N8-00 is worth considering. The user interface is not as easy to understand as iOS or even Android. The number of apps numbers in the tens of thousands.  That means there are only several hundred apps that will interest you. Basically to be happy with this handset you'll want the camera to the exclusion of all other capabilities.  It's a handset for those who can't or won't be locked into the Apple, Google, or Microsoft ecosystems.Consider that intro as my warning of ""here be monsters."" If you are adventurous then continue on:In the box you'll find a Nokia N8-00 and all the trimmings. That is to say a charger, HDMI output cable, and USB cable. And the usual safety manuals.  The Nokia N8-00 ships with Symbian^3, a 2010-era operating system with a tough interface to master and memory management problems. The only good thing about Symbian^3 is you can get rid of it.To get rid of Symbian^3 you'll need a desktop PC or laptop running Windows XP or 7, a really high speed data connection, and the latest copy of Nokia Suite (available from Nokia). Plan to download about 1 GB of data in 300 MB chunks.  Before starting your upgrade adventure, spend several hours reading the information regarding the N8-00 at [...]. You'll also have to create a Nokia account to download maps and apps. Going from Symbian^3 to Nokia Belle takes about 6-10 hours of tinkering.After installing Nokia Suite, connect the handset to the computer and let the two devices get to know each other. When the drivers are synced up you can start the software upgrade process. Nokia Suite will offer to upgrade the software from Symbian^3 to Symbian Anna. After that is completed, the next upgrade is to Nokia Belle. During the upgrade to Nokia Belle you'll see warnings forbidding you from touching the handset. Heed that warning!Getting the handset to Nokia Belle is simultaneously the beginning and end of the journey. Click on SWUpdate and download whatever remaining apps and widgets Nokia thinks you are entitled to possess on your handset. And be sure to visit the Nokia store to pick up additional apps published by Nokia (e.g. ""Internet radio"").Nokia more or less abandoned Symbian/Nokia Belle in February 2011. From a user perspective this means the bugs in the handset's firmware are here to stay. You'll have to live with the bugs and quirks and work with them or around them. At one time Symbian was the most popular smartphone OS in the world. It was also the most targeted for malware. That software is still out there. You can operate the handset without an antivirus solution but depending upon your use case that might not be an acceptable mode of operation. Fortunately, anti-malware solutions are still available and maintained by their vendors.So why would anyone buy this handset in 2013? Well, besides the camera's unusual capabilities the handset can be used as a SIP phone to make VOIP calls, Nokia provides free software to listen to radio stations that stream on the Internet, the N8-00 has an FM radio, Bluetooth, and can play music via your vehicle's FM transmitter. Or, your hotel's FM radio. The HMDI output allows you to play 720p video on a television. Replacing the battery is a trivial operation.  Repairs cost about $100, so after a year if something goes wrong an out-of-warranty repair is relatively expensive. Finally, this is one of the handsets that implemented USB On-The-Go.In the end the camera is going to make or break this handset's experience for you.

B003ZX7RL4,A9DMS5PCZU7O2,bronzedragon18,"[1, 1]","I've had the Nokia N8 for over a month now , and it's a great smartphone ! The negative reviews I've seen seem to come mostly either from people who are expecting an IPhone clone ( it just works ) or from people who don't know the Symbian ^3 OS .First , I should state that I'm not familiar with the IPhone, never used it , but I am familiar with Android ( MyTouch 3G Slide , G2 ) and RIM ( Blackberry Curve 8900 ) , but most of my smartphones have been Windows Mobile ( T-Mobile Dash , T-Mobile Dash 3G , HD2 ) , which may account for why Symbian ^3 seems so familiar and why I have no problem wth the occassional reboot . Now for the features ...Many people have dissed the N8 for the Symbian^3 UI  being clunky , which it is a bit . But I have no problem with it as it is very useful . As Rita El Khoury ( Google it ) put in an article , which I suggest you read  , "" Really there's nothing you can't do with Symbian once you know the drill . "" In this way , Symbian ^3 is very similar to WM .Reviewers have also slammed the Nokia browser too . It could use some improvement , but it's pretty good as is . It's a bit slower than the Google browser , though not much slower , and it does a good job with Flash , especially considering that the N8 has only FlashLite 4.1 . The rendering of pages could be better , though , and it really needs Flash 10.1 .Another sore point with reviewers is the keyboard , and they do have a few points here . The landscape QWERTY does have a rather odd key layout which does take some getting used to . Once used to it though , I find it to be a superior virtual KB . As to the the alphanumeric  portrait keyboard , I think Nokia needs to have a QWERTY option here ( Nokia , you need to take a hard look at the Opera Mobile 10.1 portrait QWERTY ; it's great !) . That said , there are situations ( logging in , for instance ) where the alphanumeric kb is useful .Camera on the N8 is terrific , no complaints ! Also love the video recording !  Not to forget that this is a superb multimedia device , great video and audio codec support ! Also love the  HDMI , though haven't used it lol , and the 3.5 mm AV port .Design on the N8 is first rate ! My only complaint here is that the battery is difficult to remove , but being able to disconnect the battery by an 8  second press on the power button does help . I like being able to access the SIM and micro SD cards from outside the phone , not to mention the hardware lock and camera buttons , fantastic ! Nor have I experienced any of the power or freezing issues reported by some users .Should you buy the Nokia N8 ? If you are willing to take the time to learn Symbian^3 , absolutely ! It'ss well worth the trouble and the N8  is a wonderful smartphone ! And don't forget the USB On -the - Go !Edit *****I've had my N8  for 6 months now and it's still awesome ! Here are my thoughts at 6 months .First , I should state that I'm a power user ; I use my n8 a lot , so some of the issues  I report may not be important to you and vice versa . Firdt the cons ...Proably the most annoying is that occassionally , the data connection won't engage when it should . This only happens every once in a while , but it requires  reboot , rather irritating . Nokia should really fix this IMHO .The second most annoying issue is that once in a while , the email client will stop downloading emaild for several hours .It always starts up again , and it's more of a nuisance than an issue for me , but for people who need reliable email , this woulf be an issue .Third is the new  Ovi Store , it does weird thing . U can't contact support , the emails don't go through . If u have a long list  after the first 10 items , the others display for a few seconds then disppear . The  IM for Nokia app doesn't update or install correctly . Nokia , pleaseee fixr these issues .Unlike many other N8 owners apparently , I use the Nokia browser as my chief browser . It's a great browser , just needs full Flash , better standard support !Finally , I still haven't really experienced the freezing and restart that some r reporting , other than the ones common to computers  e.g.  u have many windows open or the servers r messing up , things like that , but these r normal !One last thing , Nokia really needd to take better care of their current customers by getting the updates outrather sooner ,the new N8s have been shipping with the Anna update for almost 2 months now  yet current n8 users still don't have it !But I must ssy , the N8 is STILL  an awedome smartphone ,and I still highly recommend it !!!update 3-22-2012this is my third N8 but that`s no reflection on Nokia ; the original one was one of the infamous first batch, which had issues , just one of those things ; the second I downloaded a bad app ( cough , norton Smartphone Security , cough ) and it fried the software . Current one , no problems !One other thing , I DEFINITELY  reccommmend the Belle update , it makes the N8 even more awesome !One last thing lol .

The overall hardware is incomparable and really stands out in comparison to that of the competition. The 12 megapixel camera takes outstanding pictures and can easily replace a ""point and shoot"" camera.. Honestly the phone is an honest good buy but the Symbian OS ruines the whole user experience.I have been an avid Nokia user since the release of the Nokia N95. From there on I have owned the N82, N86 and jumped to the N900 last year. After being spoiled using the Maemo OS found in the N900 I honestly hoped that the Symbian's OS update would catch up and even exceed Maemo which has now evolved into MeeGo thanks to it's partnership with Intel. Sadly Symbian stays way behind and I found myself wanting to throw the phone across the room at times due to the various frustrations it caused.Constant freezing, long wait time, and constant clicking from one thing to another just to get a task done. I love you Nokia but Android and Apple's iOs have left you behind. I'm only hoping that Nokia's next flagship phone has MeeGo OS as it's software platform and maybe I'll jump back and be the happy customer I once was when owning a Nokia device.Overall if your looking to own a phone with excellent call quality, outstanding hardware/build and looking to replace your ""point and shoot"" camera with a phone then go ahead and make your purchase.

B003ZX7RL4,AZ47VDAIPFO1Z,Denis,"[3, 3]","I've been using the Nokia N-8 for a full four months now.  I love my phone.  It is sturdy, holds a charge well, and has plenty of cool smartphone features.  I especially like the Favorites Widget that places pictures of my Favorite contacts on the home screen, allows my to swipe through them, and then access either their phone, messaging or email.  Voice commands through an app/widget is good as well.  I love that I could load it with memory (16 internal and a 32gb micro sd that I added) for a total of 48gb.  That's allowed me to put almost all of my music on the phone (in 256kb quality) and still have lots of room for pictures, documents, apps and full applications.The radio transmitter works well for me in a Mazda Miata... but your mileage may vary and it may not work in all cars (it doesn't seem to in a Honda Pilot, for example).  Bluetooth is excellent in all vehicles I've been in or in home applications.Limitations:  No Chase or Bank of America apps.  No app for Audible.  I use an Ipod Touch for these functions, so I can live with this but I would like Audible (hint to Nokia and Audible)Nice touches:  Pictures are excellent and with the photo apps you can even enhance those functions and add neat photo effects.Body of phone is sleek and when used as is slips nicely into a guy's back pocket or shirt pocket.  Maps/guidance is fully functional.  Opera Mini Web browser is a fine app, particularly when no WiFi is available.

B003ZX7RL4,A4UTVO4FJHVZI,Douglas Auchter,"[14, 14]","I have been a Nokia user for years, owning a number of their Symbian phones (N75-3, N95-3, E71-2, E72-2, N97-3). I was eager to get this because it appeared as if it was Symbian 5th (S^1) done correctly which is what I was looking for, not to mention the camera really sucked me in. It's been a month and a half since I began using this as my primary device, and I've spent considerable time using it and comparing it to my N97 and Samsung Captivate (Galaxy S).Overall, the N8 doesn't appear to me to be a completely finished product software wise. While comparing it to my N97, I noticed that a number of features that I found very to be useful and loved were gone, like the customizable equalizer in the music player (I'm hoping Nokia gives it back to us in the next firmware update), and the GPS Data application that we always had. Still, there were other things that made me wonder what the software developers were doing during the testing phase of Symbian^3, like how there's no way to send an MMS message that gets stuck in your Outbox, or how there's no menu option to add a song to a playlist from the Now Playing screen like there was in S^1. There are plenty of other examples I can give as well, not to mention all the inconsistencies across the UI. But it's not all bad. In fact there's a lot to like about it.Here's what I liked about it:The camera is fantastic but it will take some time to really master it. Nevertheless its really easy to take a very good quick shot of something, and did I mention how real the coloring is? The days of fake reds and yellows are gone. Video recording is very good. It may not be quite as smooth as the iPhone 4, but there's no overexposure problems, coloring is real, and the audio is by far the best on the market. You can edit your photos and videos right on the phone, unlike with my Captivate, and thank you Nokia for still putting a very good camera button on the side of the phone unlike some other phone makers who don't have one at all (I can't stand that about a lot of Android phones). Reception is typical Nokia aka top notch, and phone calls are crystal clear. I love Nokia's Profile's that allow you to personalize your ringers and tones, and create and customize your own so you can have different ones for different times of the day. Build quality is very good; the best next to the E71. HDMI will actually display the whole UI on your TV unlike certain Android phones which only display your videos. It has a microSD card slot that's easily accessible and USB OTG which allows you to connect any FAT32 formatted flash drive to the phone which is really cool. Finally we have multiple homescreens on Symbian, and you can still create folders in the application menu to organize all your apps just like we've always been able to do. I love the home key that doubles as a notification light and I'm glad its a physical key. Ovi Sync which backs up your contacts, calendar and notes to a server is great. Ovi Maps (v3.06 which does not come with the phone because it's still in beta but has multitouch) is really good. The GPS on this is the best I have ever seen. The single speaker is actually pretty loud (though my N95-3 still sounds louder). Finally we have threaded SMS although it's not done properly. Video playback is very good and it has a long list of formats that will work. The music player UI looks good but is missing key features that were there in my N97 that I always used. However, I really like how disconnecting your headphones while music is playing pauses the song. Also, the volume seems to have more intervals than in previous Nokia's. I like how this isn't always connected via a data connection like a lot of Android devices (My Captivate eats through data because so many apps are constantly downloading information, like Facebook, Twitter, Weather apps, etc). Haptic feedback is really good, and at times you will really think you're actually pressing a real button. Love how it has a front facing camera unlike practically everything you get today from the carriers (thank you unlocked phone market). Love the screen saver that shows the time and any notifications. The battery will get you through the day as long as you aren't syncing email at all times during the day or running any homescreen widgets all the time like Accuweather. I was pleasantly surprised about that, although, if you're going out on Friday night and you did a lot of web browsing during the day, charge it before you go out. Ovi Suite, as much as it still needs work, is really nice to have since you can use it to back up your phone data and download maps to your phone for Ovi Maps. I love how the phone can connect to your computer as a storage device and NOT have to be used through a specific software like iTunes. I like how you can set any song you have as a ringtone, and you can do this through the music player too (again thanks to it being unlocked). The email client has a great implementation of pinch to zoom unlike the Gmail client on my Captivate which has none or the email application on it, which does a poor job of it. Leave it to Nokia to give you multitasking without rules or limits, and I like the familiar Symbian feel it still has to it.What I didn't like:There is no customizable equalizer to fine tune the sound in the music player (only presets that don't do much of anything). The non-removable battery, no matter what you try and tell me, will always be something I don't like. Don't bother using red-eye reduction before taking a photo because it just makes the subjects' eyes look weird. Just edit the photo afterwards. I personally find the 3.5"" display to be a little too narrow (a 3.7"" would have been better. There are no stereo speakers like on previous Nseries. There's a number of missing menu options that should otherwise be there, the settings menu needs to be restructured badly, and there are too many UI inconsistencies. The Facebook and Twitter apps are terrible compared to ones you get on Android. There is no portrait QWERTY, the landscape QWERTY is not designed like it should be (like the ones on Android, iOS), and the current keyboard takes up the entire display. Certain aspects of the UI are too small to be finger friendly. I find the homescreen switch button to be pointless and think it should be a customizable shortcut instead. The email client is slow and does not display HTML correctly all the time. 256MB of RAM is acceptable but 512MB of RAM would have been much better for every type of user. But I do push this phone hard. Kinetic scrolling speed is not consistent across the UI. In some applications a quick flick will give you a fast scroll, and in other applications it will give you a medium pace scroll. The phone is slower than it should be at times, like when browsing through your loaded SMS Inbox, and when Ovi Sync is running. There are the unnecessary annoying connection notifications which I can't stand, and I don't like how tapping on a link in a text message results in a pop-up instead of simply opening the link. The web browser needs at lot of work UI and page loading wise. I'm still getting all those (you are now leaving a secure website...) prompts when I just want to get to my web page. There is a slight hesitation on the first pinch to zoom in the photo gallery. Only 3 homescreens while Android has 7. The camera UI needs work, and by work, I mean completely redone. No LED flash means no flashlight/video light. There's no touch to focus in the camera for stills or video recording, and you will be cleaning the camera lens a lot. The number of apps available for the U.S. market is a joke compared to Android and iOS's app catalog. Smart dialing only looks for names instead of both names and numbers.As much as I really wanted to love this phone, I can't because of the software and all the things that were left out. Until the software gets updated and the UI gets redone, and all the things that are missing get put back in, I can only give this 3 stars overall, even though it definitely has the potential to get 5. Don't get me wrong, I like this phone, and I'm going to keep it, but I'm not completely happy with it yet. Maybe in January I will be. As far as recommending this, it's the best choice if you want a camera phone, but until the app store starts getting the top 100 apps in the Android Market and iTunes App Store, I really can't recommend this to anyone in the U.S. market who just wants a nice smartphone.For those who have Nokia phones, and are looking at getting this, it's better than anything else Nokia has offered at this point. But that's really not saying much. Symbian^3 is good, but not where it needs to be. Thankfully, there is an update planned for Q1 next year that will bring a lot of changes, but only a few which are known at this point, like the portrait QWERTY. I would wait until that update comes, and then make your decision. Also, there is a second update planned for Q3 next year where the UI will be redone.For those who have Android devices or an iPhone, I highly doubt that you'll like Symbian as it is now. In fact, I know you won't since I also own the Captivate. UI wise it's a step backwards and the app store doesn't have anywhere near the number of U.S. centric apps the other two platforms have. Unless you really want a great camera/media device/phone, I really think that you'll be more disappointed with this than anything, even with all the little things the N8 can do that others can't. Maybe after the upcoming software update, it might be more appealing, but again, if you want apps, there aren't that many good ones. Try it for yourself though.

I also use a Google Nexus One and thought I would leave Nokia behind. I decided to replace my E72 (my work phone)with another hardware qwerty phone but AT&T really didn't have a suitable replacement. Where I work, AT&T has the strongest and most reliable signal. I was planning on waiting for the Nokia E7 but the price was a bit much. I took the plunge and ordered the N8 back in February thinking I could return it if I didn't like it. When I received the phone I was surprised at how good it looked. The press and blog photos don't do this phone justice, it is a sleek and handsome phone.The build quality puts most other phones to shame. Set up was straight forward and easy. I was up and running in minutes. I use Nokia's ovi service and synced my contacts and everything OTA. Nokia did a great job with symbian^3. It is fluid, fast and intuitive. There is a slight learning curve if you are not used to symbian but I experienced a similar learning curve with android. This is a big step up from symbian 1. The camera is great as the reviews have said. I thought I would miss the hardware keyboard but I found myself typing just as fast on the (according to the tech blogs) ""substandard"" on screen qwerty. I couldn't understand this because I struggled with the Nexus One even with swiftkey. The reason for this I think is that Nokia's touch screen is of a higher quality and thus more accurate than the N1.I installed swype and I love it. The only thing I miss (being a USA user) are local apps. No apps for programing my dvr etc. Nokia has released things like ""Sleeping Screen"" and other useful apps for this phone and a large UI upgrade is in store for summer.

B003ZX7RL4,AF5MYIR1E75L8,jb in sd,"[7, 8]","I bought the Nokia N8 for my mom for Christmas because it had all the things she wanted (touch screen phone, smart phone, mp3 player, and to combine devices such as her excellent camera). Alas, she didn't want it (likes her simple flip better, easier to hold, and she doesn't like touch screen for a phone, just for an mp3 player)But ....I DIG it. It is smaller than the E7, which is a beast in comparison. Camera is amazing, flash blinding.Other awesome factors:! HDMI out! USB on the goFM transmitter - so simple, but so so convenientstorage &lt;- 16gb built in + 32gb on microsd = 48gb (plus usb)Data access is very controllable. Maps can update via sms (or network, or simple unassisted GPS). You can set priority of data access to favor wifi, or whatever priority for many access points (wifi, 3g, network, etc). Manage data. Cool. I say, get this phone, and go for a cheap GSM plan.Notes:1. came with Symbian^3, but not Anna. Anna makes the difference. If Anna hadn't updated, I would definitely have returned it. Lusting for Belle.2. camera protector - it ships with a camera protector for shipping. Remove this thing or your photos will be super hazy.Get these apps:Nokia apps: Situations, Panorama, PlayTo, Here and Now, Big Screen, Reader (but, don't subscribe to too much it will drive you crazy if a widget), Map, Drive, Places (pretty cool)Noka beta apps: Live View (frikkin awesome)3rd party, best: Fring (forward facing camera, google voice integration, etc, second favorite 3rd party), Opera Mini or Mobile (favorite 3rd party app), Wordpress3rd party, non-Ovi: Books (from Meego project, not sure who the developer is)It's kind of slippery. I think anyone who gets it will have to get some kind of protector case.Drat:1) I haven't found a way to turn on the camera flash as a flashlight like my E7 (and pretty much all my other old Nokes handsets would) will do (hold screen lock for like 5 sec till it comes on/off)2) no Kindle app3) no Netflix of Hulu4) no Meego :( why Nokia why? so sad (tho Anna is good)BELLE UPDATE;Belle is very pretty. It seems to improve performance (speed). Books (which I previously got from Meego site) now appears in the updated Nokia Store. Nokia Live View (beta app) is now Nokia City Scape.UPDATE (2012-0610):Still love the phone after 6 mo.Why? Several reasons.Amazing camera.Lots of photo & music/sound editing capability onboard (with each Symbian version), gps voice navigation the same quality as a stand alone unit (this alone makes it worth the purchase), FM extras (radio and radio out). Also, the autocorrect/predictive text is better than my ipod touch, by several orders of magnitude, which really surprises me. Also like the large onboard and very large expandable memory. And HDMI out. And built in backup options.Perpetual annoyances: not Meego (so sad so sad), no Netflix/Hulu/Amazon Video, no Kindle app. There are ways to Get Around each of these annoyances, but, well, if it had Meego there would be no need. Hoping Nokia/Accenture merges Meego with the goodies of the other open source platforms (WebOS & Meego/Tizen) and resurrects in house OS. But not holding my breath on that one.

Coming from a long line of Nokia products, I was fully prepared for some of the typical Nokia glitches/characteristics.  The N8 has a phenomenal camera, which I used extensively.  However, after sampling an Android OS smartphone, I felt a bit cheated (read: jealous) that such as powerful, high quality device like the N8 didn't have certain applications or support from its software developers.  Nokia's OVI store has come a long way from my previous E50 and E71, but at the end of the day, I felt like something was missing.  Most touch screen phones are usually easy to operate, but this one required far more (and almost unnecessary) key strokes and steps to accomplish every task, that it became exhausting to do anything.  Previous Symbian powered devices run circles around it with their old school hardware keys.  I did not experience any of the shut downs or problems may others did.  Conversely, this had so many great Nokia features and hardware I hated to return it because I'm such a Nokia fan...but with the recent withdrawal of Nokia from the US market I felt abandoned as a long term customer.Likes: excellent camera, alarm clock that works even if you power the phone off, built in OVI maps (not reliant upon the buggy network carrier), battery life, screen resolution and build quality.Dislikes: cost, lack of popular applications available for download, buggy processor at times, and extremely difficult data input method.If the E7 would have the N8's camera, or the N8 the E7's keyboard I suspect it would've been easier to live with.",3.0,1316044800,"09 15, 2011",Nokia N8 Unlocked GSM Touchscreen Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation and 12 MP Camera (Gray),189.98,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tV6EaGsXL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 11706},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

I used to be a fan of Windows Mobile a few years ago and then about 2 years ago turned Android.While must of the companies are developing or focus on great phones with fast processors, bigger and vivid screens, which one will integrate NCF?, fingerprint reader, getting app update twice a month or a lot of customROMS to flash like a maniac looking for the best performance... Me, ...tired of that life style, prepare myself for something new.I had a really bad and annoying experience with a Nokia 5800 :S It looks so FAT, screen sucks and feel so plastic! Besides that, the Symbian it uses fed me up. The menu or process for doing anything is maddening. It ask for everything. Makes me feel stupid.I did a very detailed research of this device before I placed my order. I read every single review on amazon and from other websites. At first, I was REALLY scare of the Sleep Of Dead [SOD] that happens on some units but I assume de risk and hope not to use the ""return"" option.Here are my POSSITIVE impressions of the Nokia N8:+ Penta Band 3G: Wherever I go, USA, Europe, Caribbean I'll have 3G access! That's cool.+ AMOLED screen: Looks great and it's nice to know that it has gorilla scratch resistant. Of course iF4 and must of Android devices has better graphics.+ Housing/Design: Perfect! The aluminium finish, nice material and the silver color makes a great balance.+ Camera/Xenon Flash: Much better than all Windows Mobile, Android that I've used. I cant compare to iphone4 since I haven't use it.+ FM Radio wRDS and Transmitter: Nowadays it's not common to listen FM stations but I've found the FM Transmitter very useful! The only issue is that must be really close to the radio in order to work better.+ Signal: Great. I've experience this talking volume in Blackberry devices. The sound is adequate.+ Battery: Great so far :D Gives more than a day. With Android devices battery last 6-12hrs...+ USB On the Go: Havent test it but It's really cool to know It's on your device!+ HDMI: Havent test it but It's really cool to know It's on your device!NEGATIVE Impressions from other REVIEWS and my fixes:- Virtual Keyboard: Yes, it's bad at first. Need some time to get used to it but It's good using Spanish language. We'll have an update soon, so, we hope Nokia do something with this! There is also another keyboard called ""DAYHAND"" just google it... It seems that is not available any more.- Browser: IT REALLY SUCKS!!! Try Opera and use Opera Link to have your Favorite websites linked.- No OFFICE Documents Edit: Yes, This was fixed with an update... Anyways I don't use it.- Video Recording has no light: So? Some other devices don't have it either... Im so satisfied with the Xenon that I don't really care of LED.- Battery is not User friendly replaceable: So?!?!?! With Symbian there is no need of flash-a-holic and do some crazy app installations. Just press the power button for a few seconds and I'll restart.- Poor Application Store: It's right, it's not the best. But must of the application I use are available. Too bad Developers are not motivated :(- GPS: I can't use OVI MAPS in my country. Looking for google maps for Symbian...EXPECTATIONS1) Announcement of the next update with fixes of all software issued including new keyboard!.2) Hope my N8 dont DIE!!!

B003ZX7RL4,A3VAROHXBXV0I2,M. Messinger,"[4, 5]","The N8 is my second Nokia phone, after the E71. Granted, I'm finding it challenging to move from the E71's QWERTY keyboard to the virtual keyboard on the N8. But, the challenges don't end there. Let me back up and say, first off, both that I really wanted to love the N8 and also that its hardware gives a lot to be loved.The phone feels great in the hand. The camera is all you've probably heard about, and more (plus, third party developers are now releasing apps that really unleash the camera's capabilities to the amateur photographer). Battery life is pretty good - not exceptional, but really good for a smart phone. I use this phone a lot and only occasionally have I had to put it on a USB or car charger, in the late afternoon. 3.5MM headphone jack is welcome. MicroSDHC slot puts the N8 ahead of the E7, in my opinion. Despite the modest clock speed of its CPU, I rarely experience sluggish behavior from this phone.Personally, I think Microsoft made a good move, in their alliance with Nokia; this phone proves Nokia's hardware is among the top of smart phones available today. The WindowsPhone OS can only go up, whereas I've about given up hope that Nokia's software development will ever improve. While Symbian^3 is a significant improvement over particularly the touchscreen capabilities of its Symbian predecessors, Nokia is not breaking any land-speed records with it's OS development cycle. Integration with PC-and cloud-based calendar, contacts, tasks, and other apps is really bad. Nokia's decision to prohibit the newest versions of Nokia PC Suite from syncing with the N8 - forcing N8 users to rely upon the awful and fatally buggy Nokia Ovi Suite - frankly illustrates some arrogant disregard Nokia holds for its customer base. Nokia Ovi Suite is but one reason why Nokia is failing in the market for higher-end phones. Perhaps Microsoft can help shore up Nokia's fortunes in this area; it's hard to imagine the alliance with Microsoft making the software situation with Nokia much worse.Both the portrait and landscape keyboards are finicky; even Swype (while a big improvement over the delivered landscape keyboard) lags behind Android and iOS keyboards. Third party developers, such as mobileways.de, which develop the excellent Twitter app, ""Gravity,"" have proven keyboard design can be much better, on Symbian (in fact, Gravity proves there's much that can be done with the entire Symbian UI, if Nokia only applied itself).Nokia continues to only partially implement significant enhancements - it allows users to designate an alternate browser, as the default, then never calls the default browser; only using its lackluster native browser (although update PR2.0, expected in March or April, 2011, is expected to produce an improved browser). Particularly if Opera Mobile adds pinch-to-zoom, I expect even Nokia's updated browser will find itself not listed as most user's default web browsers. Symbian^3 allows for multiple calendars to be created, but there's no way to accept appointments received as iCal files attached to emails into one specific calendar; they only go to the default and have to be manually moved to another calendar, if desired. Symbian still has no notion of ""categories"" for appointments, tasks, contacts, or as a file attribute (a feature the Palm OS had, more than a decade ago). Don't expect to sync categories from Outlook, for example, to your Nokia phone. The calendar on the N8 is the worst calendar I've ever seen on a smart phone. No agenda view; no way to exclude tasks from what few views offered; an awful month-at-a-glance view. . . the calendar on the N8 is a real step backwards, even when compared to the old E71. Here again is an example where the WindowsPhone OS can only produce better functionality. It is astonishing to me that, even now, no third party developer has released a calendar app that beats the awful calendar shipped on the N8.As of this writing, there is no ereader app available for commercial ebook formats such as the Kindle, eReader.com, MobiPocket, or Nook. This is but one example of the considerable disregard of the Symbian^3 OS held by the commercial developer marketplace. I fear this is one area where the Microsoft alliance will pose a challenge; will developers continue to work with Symbian, even after the phone is updated to Symbian^4, with the possibility the WP OS will spell the future for high-end Nokia phones?Nokia continues efforts at developing innovative new apps, through its Beta Labs, but it is not rolling out needed updates to basic products such as Nokia Ovi Suite, fast enough.There are some things Symbian^3 does do very well. It's multitasking capabilities and memory management are head-and-shoulders above other mobile OS', in my opinion. While Nokia has implemented copy-and-paste relatively poorly, in the N8, that feature and many others are available. Ovi Maps is one standout application that ships with the phone (and its turn-by-turn navigation is a real value-added feature to this phone). The music app isn't half bad (but, Nokia, why do you make it possible for me to edit photos and video directly on the phone, but make it impossible to edit MP3 tags?) and the video playback is very good, whether on the phone or using its HDMI output.I could go on, but I should probably instead get to the bottom line: Do I recommend this phone? Yes and No. If you are already familiar with Symbian - the good and the bad - then you'll probably find a lot to like, in the N8. On the other hand, if you aren't interested in tinkering with your phone, you might want to seriously consider the iPhone, one of the many Android phones or (for those of you looking for a business-oriented phone) a Blackberry. Every week or two, I debate about whether I'm going to sell my N8 and return to the trusty E71; if you go with the N8, you need to do so after looking at both the good and the bad. And maybe PR2.0 and the other promised updates in 2011 actually will improve the prospects for this Symbian device. At least, that is, until Nokia's phones sporting the WindowsPhone - Nokia style - start to hit the street.",4.0,1299542400,"03 8, 2011",Nokia N8 Unlocked GSM Touchscreen Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation and 12 MP Camera (Gray),189.98,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tV6EaGsXL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 11706},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

I couldn't resist giving the N8 a shot to see what advances Symbian 3 had made. All I can say is it hasn't come very far. When you are used to the blinding speed of advancement in the android space its hard to imagine how Nokia are going to stay relevant.This is amazing piece of hardware, but how frustrating it is to be back on symbian. I dont even know where to start suffice to say that I am back on android after only a few days with N8.

The music player works well and the camera is the best I've seen on a phone; it has great editing tools and it can be used with an HDTV. I can access my email, browse the web and IM family and friends; all from my phone. It switches to WiFi whenever available so you don't have charges from your phone carrier. The manual is well written and easy to follow (I printed a copy and put in a 3-ring binder for easy reference). I had no trouble setting the phone up initially. The free maps, GPS and navigation system are great for traveling all over the world. Because it is an unlocked phone, I can switch SIM cards and change carriers in the USA or get a local country SIM when traveling internationally. The OVI suite is easy to use, allows you to easily update your contacts/calendar, the OVI web site offers great support and many apps to download for free and to purchase, and the OVI Music works seamlessly to make playlists and sync to your phone.

I downloaded maps for usa, canada,mexcio,china and hongkong along with street name prompt voice in English(us) and mandarin(china) within 2 hours. no need to bother data plan.I am currently owning Garmin 765, Tomtom 540XL and Megellan 4700. Nokia n8 is the best among them due to its super fast gpu, 16GB flash memory, crisp AMOLED screen at highest resolution (640x360),super loud speaker and multi-touch capacitive screen. (Garmin 765 is slow in rendering and touch input is buggy, Tomtom 540xl tele atlas map is not as presice as navteq for usa, megellan 4700 is poor in rendering vector maps due to its screen resolution and bad bluetooth).The 12 mega pixel buit-in camera surpasses my 10 mega pixels Canon point and shoot camera A1000. Night shot is even better than my 18 mega pixels Canon T2 DSLR. but it takes some time to get used to since looks like it doesn't come with image stablization altough it is supported in vedio recording, user has to slowly and gently press down the camera button to take a picture even after haivng fully focused.Nokia n8 has managed networks nicely, it is fully  customizable for prority to use 3.5G, Edge, wifi. default is wifi, 3.5G then at&t; edge for internet. it allow user to create different network destination and select one as default. main internect apps allow user to choose customized network destionations.Nokia mail supports yahoo, msn, gmail, etc and microsoft exchange server, user can manage all various email accounts in one place and it supports archive folers for yahoo mail. there is a minor bug,  due to its push email feature, it keeps turning on wifi if it is available even when user exits nokia mail application and turns off wifi manually. i believe this minor bug can be fixed easily when nokia are ready to update.another potential problem is that it can not show chinese/japanese/korean due to the location setting of usa and the missing of fonts library. nokia may formally allow user to download and install the east asian fonts. curretly it shows China map in Chienes pingyin. for chinese web pages and contacts it shows rectangular box instead which needs to be fixed as nokia promtotes the conecting of people.fring works fine with n8, it can be downloaded from ovi store right from the phone and it is free, it supports instant messenging (fring, msn,gtalk, yahoo,etc), video call and voip call. no need to bother skype which is not available for nokia n8.the built-in web browser is already very nice to show web pages with multi-touch to zoom, flash to play youtube, java 2.1 to play java game. so I haven't tried the opera 10 or opera mini-browser 5.1.FM radio can be directed to its own loud speaker though it is still required to plug-in the accompanied headset as an antenna. FM radio is super sensitive, can pick weak signal, and sends out better sound than lexus car stereo, sadisk sansa FM radio. super basss is excellent but don't know how to disable it, looks like nokia n8 doesn't have built-in Equalizer application, should be easy to find one over ovi store.as always, nokia n8 is a phone with excellent signal and voice at both ends. rock-solid built. looks and feels noble. can last for at least 4 years.I bought it for my kid's usage during her University study.

The iPhone is a great phone but just not the one of my taste.Why did I choose the N8? well, it has all that I wanted.I am currently outside the US and the 3G frequency here is 850MHz which narrows my options.The HTC: Only specific models has the HSPDA 850MHz (A8182 & A8183) which are quite difficult to find on Amazon, in fact I was not able to find one!The Samsung: Checked with a friend's phone and the signal coverage was not that good.The Motorola: Great phone (xenon flash, HDMI out, HD Video capability), but a bit too big to fit confortably in my handI currently own a Nokia E51 and it is a great phone, in over 2 years no issues at all and the signal coverage is amazing (My wife works at a school out in the mountain area, and where all the other phones(Samsung, LG, Motorola) have failed with the network coverage(screen shows searching for network) this one wins by far (80% signal strenght)Purchased the phone on ""Cyber Monday"" for $429. Got the ""Made in china"" one and was a bit worried based on the reviews I saw, but I've had no issues at all with the phone(most of our electronic devices are made in China anyway). It even came with the updated firmware(RM596) and all the software updated as well (OVI suite shows ""No updates available"")Only some minor annoyances so far:1. Sometimes (less now than before) The screen will not respond to touch. I tap and tap and tap again and nothing, as if it was not aware that I was tapping or maybe I am not doing it correctly.2. Sometimes when I flip the phone, the screen will not rotate, I have to return it to portrait and then flip it and then it will rotate the screen. Amazingly, if the phone is on the table, as soon as I pick it up, the screen rotates!3. The home screen is a bit simple and you cannot place widgets side by side. Solved by installing SPB Mobile Shell4. The browser is not that bright so I use Opera Mobile 10 instead.5. No QWERTY keyboard in Portrait mode (weird as when using Opera, you get the QWERTY keyboard in portrait mode)6. No ""custom"" setting for equalizer as my E51 hasBedides these, which I can live with, the phone is working great. I get 100% battery after 1 complete day of usage. Power Saving Mode is nice to cutdown battery dain.Played Angry Birds, Neef For Speed Shift, Real Golf 2011 and Galaxy On Fire and they all ran flawlessly.Now, I can leave my Zen Multimedia Player(N8 Headphones have a great sound) and my Panasonic Lumix Camera at home as I have both features in the N8, plus, I can use it to make and receive calls.",5.0,1292198400,"12 13, 2010",Nokia N8 Unlocked GSM Touchscreen Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation and 12 MP Camera (Gray),189.98,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tV6EaGsXL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 11706},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

I purchased N8 before Thanksgiving at $429 to be able to access T-Mobile 3G and get better GPS and camera, as well as larger screen and touch interface.I like N8, but I wish I waited with the switch until the firmware upgrade is available.The phone has some issues that are mostly software, not hardware related based on my exchanges with Nokia and reading various forum postings.The most annoying one is this phone's refusal to stop searching for WiFi when requested manually. I've never seen it in any phone I have owned.The second is apparent incompatibility of some of the voice guidance files with the maps. My UK voice guidance works fine, but not US with street names, which is silent. Standard Nokia Tech advice - do hard reset. I wonder why Nokia even bothers employing Tech Support people. After dealing with them for 20 years I find them pretty much useless.The biggest problem that is not software related (I think - Nokia helpers have no clue - do a hard reset they say ?!) is very poor flash performance. My N82 has N8 beaten hands down. At 10ft distance my N82 photo is nice and sharp; the N8 photo is grainy. This despite of supposedly bigger N8 sensor and 12 MP versus 5MP.The HD video though works great, except for low light conditions again, and flash will not work with video.Overall I am sufficiently happy with the purchase to keep it. I'll use my N82 as a backup with other SIM cards when travelling. Again, I wish I waited till they resolve various bugs. I always liked Nokia and it is so dissappointing to see that they cannot get their act together. In Nokia Support forums Nokia reps are missing.

The cameraphone is incredible 12mp, with easy-to-learn picture, movie and editing options.  The phone gives good service.  But that's where the love affair ends.I've had no luck at all with the supplied Nokia Ovi Browser.  It's awful, suddenly goes non-responsive, interprets pinch-to-zoom as clicking on something my fingers happened to come close to, won't stop, won't go to what I click on (despite the bio-feedback you feel which sort of 'clicks' when you touch a link).  Except for reading the news, it's practically useless.So I downloaded Bolt.  I've had great success with Bolt on other phones.  Unfortunately, there's no 'arrow' feature for the N8, so I'm left with the same non-responsive touch problem as on the Ovi Browser.So I downloaded Opera.  Mini.  Then Mobile.  Same problems with the iffy touchscreen.So I downloaded some cheapo Chinese browser.  It's okay in mobile mode, but as basic as can be.I'm flummoxed, and I guess I'm keeping the phone.

B003ZX7RL4,AWA3U2TAU0KYP,"Solom01 ""software user""","[3, 3]","My N8 is the last Symbian phone I will ever own, and since I noticed that the reviews for this phone are all over the place I figured I would try to write a balanced review. I have owned lots of Nokia phones (e71, e75, 5800, C6-01, 701), and two Android phones (original Nexus and the Google Nexus Galaxy GSM) so I have a pretty good idea of the difference between Android and Symbian. I've never owned an iPhone, but I do have a new iPad and a touch, so I have a pretty good idea of what iOS5 is like.The main advantages of the N8 is the build quality (I've never seen a company build hardware that's as nicely put together as Nokia) and the incredible flexibility of the phone and operating system. I mean this phone has an FM radio, FM transmitter for use when you rent a car or need to make a quick connection to a car radio that doesn't have Bluetooth or inputs, USB input, hdmi output, and what is without a doubt the best camera in a cell phone until the 808 came out.  Symbian Belle is in many ways more flexible than Android (and certainly more flexible than iOS which forces you to use the wretched iTunes and makes it a pain to import or export anything from it). The phone itself is pentaband so you can use it in almost all of the world where GSM is available. It has 16 gb of memory built in and you can add a microSD card for even more storage - unlike the iPhone or many newer Android phones, and the size is perfect. My newer Nexus has a 4.7 inch screen and feels like a tablet when I hold it to my head.The problem is that as they did with the N97 the self destructive folks at Nokia hobbled this phone with an extremely slow processor and only 256mb of program memory. In spite of the efficiency of Symbian, this lack of hardware guarantees that your phone will run sluggishly (if not when new shortly thereafter as you use it) and that installing any new software (such as the mobile Microsoft Office that was just released) will be a nightmare, requiring you to try to decide what you're going to have to remove to make it fit.  The 701 which I also owned had double the processor speed and program memory and it made the exact same Belle software run much more smoothly and gave you enough program memory to not have to worry about it.  For the life of me, why Nokia would design a phone that originally sold for about $600 and save a few cents by not including the appropriate processor and memory is impossible to understand.  It's not like they hadn't seen what that did to the N97 and the damage it caused to Nokia's reputation, but for some reason as a company Nokia was incapable of listening to any criticism or learning from their mistakes.So, I use my Nokia when I'm in an area where I need navigation but can't get data (Nokia maps has world wide free maps that you can download and use without a data connection, even now Google maps only let's you pre download a very small area), and when I think I will want to take pictures since the camera is good enough to replace a point and shoot camera. Yup, in a word, it's the perfect vacation phone. However, when I need a phone to actually get work done with or want to have access to some of the more popular apps like Netflix or Pandora I use my Nexus. It is a complete shame, because if Nokia had tried even a little bit the n8 could have been a real contender. For a while the popularity of Nokia in India and China allowed them to survive, but now with their switch to Windows 8 and the popularity of Android in those countries it seems like final curtain calls for Nokia.  So, at the current price if you want a good phone to travel with and an example of what could have been, this is a good purchase, but if you are only going to have one phone that you have to use day to day unfortunately even at these fire sale prices you're probably much better off buying the Google Nexus.",4.0,1341446400,"07 5, 2012",Nokia N8 Unlocked GSM Touchscreen Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation and 12 MP Camera (Gray),189.98,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tV6EaGsXL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 11706},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"
B003ZX7RL4,A109AX0741DNR9,"T. Opel ""-Tib""","[0, 3]","After owning a Nokia N900, I find this phone very disappointing.I knew I wasn't going to like not having a physical keyboard, but I found it almost impossible to type on this phone. Some of you may find this as a plus if you forget to lock your phone, but the heat sensitive touch-screen really doesn't work well for me. I find that every other letter I type is missed because I am used to tapping with my fingernails, it allows for more precision. Being forced to use my finger tips, not only am I struggling to hit every character, but every other one I do hit, is the wrong one, because the buttons are too small to use the tips of my fingers.I am also extremely disappointed in the fact that the battery is embeded and therefor not replaceable. I have always found solace in the fact that I can pick up a spare battery for a few dollars if the current one isn't holding a good charge. I also like keeping a spare battery around for every phone I own, in case for some reason the phone dies and I can't find my charger, or similar problems. And just to iterate the importance of being able to change a battery, the last N900 I owned, the charger port quit working, and broke completely lose. It was a pain, but I was still able to use the phone, due to keeping a spare battery and an external battery charger. If something along those lines happened with this N8, that would be impossible.Then there is the fact that they have reverted from the standard micro-usb charger port to the little dinky nokia charger. I used to be okay with that little dinky plug for nokia phones, I kind of liked the fact that a lot of their phones had the same  charger, while other companies had different chargers for almost every phone. However, after having gotten used to the new standard micro-usb charging port that almost every new phone has, I have not been too worried about forgetting my charger. To go back to having to remember to haul a charger around all the time would be quite annoying and unnecessary in my opinion.Overall, I am disappointed with the N8, originally I was willing to step down and accept a phone that I think is lacking some serious technology, because I love Nokia. But, when it comes to reality, look at HTC's phones... Nokia is charging the same price for a single core 1ghz processor while HTC has dual core 1.2ghz processors in their phone. Nokia is also behind in the fact that they don't have a single 4G phone, or an android phone. Nokia has a little more ram, but what use is that if the phone can't handle enough programs to use that ram. And the thing that made the N900 so amazing, is the Maemo operating system. To go back to the Symbian OS, I felt confined. I would take Android over Symbian any day. Now Nokia is going to drop Symbian for the Microsoft Windows Mobile 7 OS? YUCK! The one thing nokia has going for their phones, is the cameras. But once again, lets be real, it's nice to be able to snap a good shot when I'm on the road or something, but any photo I want to come out nice, I pull out my nice camera. The cameras on phones just aren't high enough quality yet to be able to take the same kind of pictures that a stand-alone camera can. A decent phone camera can only go so far, it doesn't make or break the sale in my opinion.As for looks, the phone looks great, the camera looks great, if I was only going for show and not usability, this would be a good phone. But lets be serious, I can't be stuck with a phone that I can hardly use.",2.0,1318377600,"10 12, 2011",Nokia N8 Unlocked GSM Touchscreen Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation and 12 MP Camera (Gray),189.98,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tV6EaGsXL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 11706},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

Call sound quality is superb.

Nokia-provided VoIP call support is available. Apps are there, marginally lagging behind Android/Iphone. True multitasking. I'm not a big fan of the Symbian menu system but still this phone is a big improvement over S60.

Alert! Alert! If you need to be able to read/write messages in non-latin based languages think twice bebore buying this Phone, at least the US version sold by Amazon as there is no official support for that. It is such a shame that a great device such as n8 has this limitation. No hope to get this working with the upcoming or future s/w update according to Nokia Care. There are limited workarouds such as using third party keyboard apps, using browser to read emails, or hacking the phone and installing customized fonts. Knocking down 1 star because of this (really should be -2 but I realize this may not be an issue for most ppl out there)Update #2:Installed Symbian Belle. Very nice. Brings significant visual and usability improvements, qwerty portrait and split-screen landscape keyboards, most importantly the UI is much smoother and more responsive now, very pleasant to use almost as good as the i-device and newer androids. Apps are still lagging and it won't get any better. Out of the box input language support is still an issue, you're limited to what Nokia thinks you should be using in your region, so if you buy an official US phone but need to write in Cyrillic good luck with that, there are ways around it but in 2012 this should be built-in into the device.",4.0,1293321600,"12 26, 2010",Nokia N8 Unlocked GSM Touchscreen Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation and 12 MP Camera (Gray),189.98,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tV6EaGsXL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 11706},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

Maybe assistance on working days only, so maybe tomorrow?Found on internet additional hard reset besides maintaining power key for 8 seconds: Press menu - camera - volume down keys together. Than try again power key for 8 seconds until phone vibrates. Could get phone to turn on and charge battery. It died several more times, but could get it alive this way again. After several days it seems stable now.As a comment found on internet: it is like buying a new BMW/Mercedes having to ask road assistance to start it!!Update 24.12.2010 - After 4 days it died again being able to start it up again after waiting a few hours doing the same tricks again. Than once more it turned off. Decided to turn it in to go for another brand/model.

B003ZX7RL4,A3Q3DCVDKZHRRW,Yoft,"[7, 7]","EDIT: Today, (Feb 11, 2011) Nokia announced that it is moving to adopt the Windows Phone 7 platform.  That means that it is ditching the MeeGo system almost completely and will plan to phase out support for Symbian in the next year or two.  That isn't quite enough for me to change my review on the phone, because the phone still holds its own as the best hardware on the market right now.  But you'll have to keep in mind that Nokia will slowly stop rolling out updates for Symbian.  If you're still attracted by the hardware, I say still go for it definitely.  Like I state in my review, Symbian^3 is more than adequate, it is just slightly clunkier than it's competitors, but it CAN do everything that other OS's can do.  If you're not particularly in love with the hardware or hardware is less important to you, I would look elsewhere, or at least wait until Nokia starts rolling out the Windows Phone 7 mobile devices.  So this news really shouldn't affect either camp of potential buyers: those buyers that are looking for great hardware (like me), this phone is still a worthy investment; those buyers that are looking for the whole package and would be willing to make hardware sacrifices for a better OS, I would wait until Nokia starts making Windows phones and compare those to Android/iOS.Hardware:+ Very solid construction, the body is made out of solid aluminum and there are no loose parts whatsoever+ The screen is made out of gorilla glass, which is about as close to having a bulletproof glass cellphone screen as you'll ever get.  It's pretty much impossible to scratch this screen, trust me people have tried on youtube and failed.+ Capacitive touch screen with limited multitouch support (see software for further details)+ Amazing camera, as of this moment, this is pretty much indisputably the best camera phone on the market.  Gone are the days of inch thick camera phones that only output 8MP cameras with a much smaller sensor, the N8 takes 12MP photos with a sensor that is larger than many dedicated cameras.  Megapixels hardly tell the whole story, but the sensor size goes a long way to allowing your N8 to replace your dedicated camera.+ Built in xenon flash, the N8 uses a legitimate camera flash and in my anecdotal use, it has the same range of illumination as my point and shoot.  The LED flash on many other phones can't compare to a real xenon flash+ Video is very clear and can record in 720p resolution.  One of the best features of this phone's video capabilities is the fact that when zooming, it uses the fact that it can take up to 12MP frames so that when you zoom in video it maintains 720p resolution and uses more of the camera's capabilities.  For those of you who know how digital zoom works, that means that while digital zoom while taking pictures still is pretty much pointless, the N8 allows you to take full resolution 720p all the way through the zoom levels and isn't just a digital zoom of your original 720p frame.+ Built in FM transmitter means that you can play your music through a radio signal which your car's radio can pick up once you tune to that frequency.  You don't need to mess with adapters or cables.  The signal isn't extremely strong, so your mileage may vary depending on your phone's location relative to the antennae in your car.+ Built in GPS with FREE LIFETIME MAP UPDATES AND VOICE NAVIGATION.  That means essentially for the price, you are getting a built in GPS with your phone, that performs just like a standalone GPS.  You can use the GPS without a data plan with no problem at all, it picks up a signal quickly and is very accurate.  If you're worried about the phone accessing the data network accidentally, you can just turn off A-GPS (the only function that uses data).  The GPS will still work perfectly normal, it will just take slightly longer to pinpoint your position.- Since there is no LED, there is no video light available for the phone and that also means you can't use the phone as a flashlight, unless you use the screen with the application QTorch does nicely.- OVI maps (the GPS software) occasionally does weird routes that are not necessarily the best nor the fastest, but it will always take you to your destination, regardless.Software:+ Three completely personalizable home screens that you can swipe left or right to access.  You can provide a shortcut to any of your apps (including third party ones), put in a list of your favorite contacts in a scrollable bar as a widget, get access to email, music player, etc.+ Gallery is now much improved in that you can ""check"" multiple items at once for deletion or to email, instead of deleting one picture at a time, which was a huge problem in S60v5.+ General use is generally snappy in and out of menus.- Essentially what S60v5 should have been, it doesn't make huge changes other than the home screens, it just fixes up some of the bugs in S60 like the inconsistent double/single tap to open applications.- Occasionally phone felt slightly underpowered, but these cases were few and far between- Overall, the user interface (UI) is not as polished as Apple's iOS or Google's Android.  Things aren't always as intuitively placed as you would like.  But in terms of functionality, Symbian^3 can do everything that the above two OS's can do, it just doesn't really make all the features as accessible.Bottom Line:This phone is extremely well built and has pretty much all the hardware options you can ask for in terms of camera, video shooting, build quality/materials, FM transmitter, built in and free GPS.  In terms of software, Nokia's OS lags behind iOS and Android, but it is fully capable, just not as polished.  The main draw for this phone, however, is the fact that it is unlocked.  Which means if you don't need a data plan (more importantly, if you don't feel the need to pay and additional $30 per month), you do not have to get one for this phone.  Nowadays, every carrier will force you to get a data plan for your phone, which in the long run, comes out to be much more than the cost of buying this phone unlocked ($200 for an iPhone 4, plus $30 additional data plan for 24 months comes out to be $920 just for the data plan.  Not to specifically rag on the iPhone 4, just providing an example of buying any smartphone from a carrier).  That was the big draw for me, and then the amazing camera and free GPS were just bonus features.",5.0,1297209600,"02 9, 2011",Nokia N8 Unlocked GSM Touchscreen Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation and 12 MP Camera (Gray),189.98,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tV6EaGsXL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 11706},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"
B0046LTU9G,A3K87CKSZF2PV,3rd I,"[1, 2]","As a user of the N8 for some time I have become frustrated with its small screen; 3.5 inches just does not cut it anymore for a high priced touchscreen device. So I bit the bullet and ordered the E7.  Let me tell you up front it is a very attractive design with a stunning screen viewable outside even with the brightness set on low;  many times i have been astounded by the wonderful visibility of its Clear Black  AMOLED Display and the 4 inch screen makes a big difference for me in comfort and usability.I do not want to waste time rehashing info clearly described in other reviews so lets get to the meat of the situation:1 -If you take any type of up close / macro shots on a regular basis you will be terribly disappointed. The camera is just not good for that type of imagery.  All other photography is great in most well lit situations even with out great lighting you can get decent shots.2 - The Wifi is quite finicky on these phones so you maybe reconnecting a bit (OK, a lot!).  I thought it was just my unit but it seems many users are having this issue.  It's not bad enough for me to not want to use the phone but it might be for you.Nokia really screwed the pooch on this magnificent phone; just adding a 5mp auto focus camera would have been sufficient and not cannibalized the N8 sales. The Wifi issue is not that big for me and could probably be easily resolved with firmware.I am writing this for people who already know about the Symbian OS and understand its strengths and limitations.

B0046LTU9G,AE4Y5P9V7TWKC,headset reviewer,"[3, 5]",">>> Below Is an UPDATE as of October 20, 2012Symbian Belle update (not received Symbian Belle Refresh update yet).Belle update from Q1 of 2012 has changed a lot of things on this phone, so i'll start over.  (I still have the phone)>>>>>> AN IMMEDIATE STOP TO CONSIDERING THE PURCHASE OF THIS PHONE is Nokia's non existent support to addressing the bug that makes SMS messaging completely unreliable (see Bads section)Good:- Screen can be used in direct sunlight- Physical keyboard is excellent.  Tactile feed back is better than blackberry or T-Mobile G2.- Off-line maps.  Usefull when you don't want to use online maps when roaming (data roaming charges are expensive).  Better than Google maps because it provides ""recalculation"" of directions if you go off course.- Penta band 3G, It'll work in any GSM or 3G carrier (will not work on CDMA)- Ring profiles.  Very detailed preset profiles for volume/ring/vib/etc settings can be easily switched between.  Android (T-Mobile G2) does not have this level of customization or ability to switch between profiles.- Notification ring tone can be set to a an mp3 (Android, or at least G2 can't do this)- Sound quality from mic is very good, just make sure you aren't let down by a half-duplex voice carrier like Wind Mobile.- Front facing camera... but see cons side...- Reception is good, but not the top 10%.- Plays most video formats i've tried.  Can't play MKV and some AVI files.- now able to EASILY turn WIFI, Bluetooth etc on and off easily via the pull down status window blind.- design and build, it has a sturdy & premium feel when you look at it and hold it in your hand.- works with perfectly with LG bluetooth headset HBS-700, Plantronics Voyager Pro, Plantronics Voyager Pro+Bads:- Nokia's SMS system will sometimes not send msgs and leave them in the ""Outbox"" and not attempt to resend.  This happens with about half or two thirds of my SMS's.  When the ""Outbox"" SMS's are manually selected to re-send the recipient will get it, but on rare occasions it will be received twice.- I would not say Symbian Belle is 'clunky', but Android offers a more intuitive user interface & experience.  Try activating bluetooth or any other phone related function during a phone call... it's extremely hard if not impossible because the phone's screen pauses and stops during calls.  Also, The dialing buttons are VERY small (vertically), yet at least 1/3 of the same screen is unused!!!  Seriously, what's up with that screen Nokia!?!?!? Many more examples like this!- App market is very limited.  Prior to purchase i didn't think it would be an issue, but after using a T-Mobile G2 it is a major issue.  For instance, there are no banking applications for Symbian.  The Tunein radio app is not available & the free Nokia Internet Radio app is horrible.- Offline maps: can't get transit info/next bus times from maps.... but you can install google's online maps for that...- Nokia's support: Nokia has done NOTHING to solve several major bugs, one of which is well known since at least 2010 (see next few examples)- Nokia's program to sync MS Outlook's calendar with the phone pushes some re-occurring appointments one day forward.  (embarrassing to say happy birthday to business colleagues on the wrong day, one day earlier).  this bug is known since at least 2010.- when listening internet radio, the audio will skip/pause when you scroll the screen, rotate the screen or start to anything else.- Battery life is quite poor.  I must charge at least once a day.  With full charge, listening to internet radio through stereo bluetooth lasts about 2 hours at most.  Talk time from full charge is about 3.5 to 4 hrs using bluetooth.  T-Mobile G2 battery lasts significantly longer, for instance internet radio through bluetooth lasts 4-5 hours.- GPS is not as accurate or fast as other phones (not confusing with Assisted-GPS).  It takes several minutes (sometimes never) to obtain a GPS location fix.- the front facing camera is poor quality, even for VGA.  Other than Fring, and MS Lync, no programs are available to use the front camera for chat.  However, who uses Fring?... and MS Lync is only for internal corporate clients who have a MS Lync server.  Skype video chat is not available.- My carrier (Wind Mobile) does not ""support"" (disabled) the built in video calling.- the rear 8mp camera is also of very poor quality.  5mp phone cameras are superior.  Photos closer than six to ten feet are almost always out of focus (either totally blury, or background is in focus but not the subject in foreground is not in focus).  Photos of a paper with any size writing are an embarassment.  Photos further than six to ten feet are sometimes blurry, but always do not have sufficient detail.  All this is because the phone uses a software based focusing system.- not able/safe to use phone as wifi hotspot. Joiku spot app for $15 can turn phone into wifi hotspot, but it only uses the cracked we encryption protocol.Summary: DO NOT BUY.  Despite an excellent build quality, keyboard & a good screen that can be seen in direct sunlight, I would not get this product again.  The drawbacks of the user interface & experience in general, plus Nokia's non existent support substantially outweigh the benefits of this phone.",1.0,1324425600,"12 21, 2011","Nokia E7-00 Unlocked GSM Phone with Touchscreen, QWERTY Keyboard, Easy E-mail Setup, GPS Navigation, 8 MP Camera--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver)",249.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516%2BdiKaeFL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 56934},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"
B0046LTU9G,AF5MYIR1E75L8,jb in sd,"[4, 5]","I received this e7 as a gift. It runs Symbian^3 Anna, Software Version 022.014.02.01, released 2011-07-05. Other features: Nokia Web browser 7.3 / Flash 4.0 / Java 2.2.I have had Nokia smart phones before, the last was an n95; thus, I've been familiar with Symbian s60 devices.My n95, which I'll benchmark the e7 against, had great:essential phone functionsfocusing camera with flash (which took unparalleled pictures)speaker qualityoffice functionalityDESIGN:The e7 is finely made, very Nokia: stylish, tight lines, understated, elegant, aristocratic. Hinge mechanism is higher quality than similar mechanisms on other phones I've tried. It is slightly larger than the iPhone 4G and slightly heavier, but it fits nicely in my pocket and is not much more cumbersome than my n95 or my SE Equinox. The touchscreen makes a little buzz when you touch it; some phones don't do this so I find it useful.TOUCHSCREEN:This is my first touchscreen phone. It took some getting used to but after a couple days no biggie, in landscape. Typing on touchscreen is surprisingly accurate in landscape. Comparison: I make more errors on iOS and Android (without Swype, though less with) than this phone; don't ask my why. Portrait typing - no dale. Swype is available, but actually I don't like it much. I still make some errors though. Screen quality itself is absolutely beautiful; though my coworker's current 5g iPod touch has better resolution.Other phones & media players have better screen resolution: iPod touch, various Samsung & HTCs as well.KEYPAD:My first QWERTY phone. Keypad is quality though, has control, shift, function keys, and arrows. Complete with alternate shift keyboard (yellow characters, key on bottom left) though positioning makes it a tad difficult to actuate the 3rd character on keys in the bottom left of the keypad. But you can cycle through a key's alternate letters by pressing the key repeatedly. I prefer standard dialpads with t9 (or iTap on Motorolas), but this one is high quality too. I like.CAMERA:The 8MP camera is quite nice. Photos and light are not as rich or deep on this camera as on the n95 which had a focusing camera. As standard for Nokia, the camera app is great. Camera goodies such as Picture and Video editor software integrate nicely into the camera app itself. So sad that the phone doesn't have Carl Zeiss on board as my n95 made lust worthy 5mp photos my friends swore couldn't come from a phone. I understand lack of CZ focusing mechanics keeps size down (what about that awesome n8 camera though ...... arg). But the app itself I like better than the Android or iOS camera apps.MUSIC:Music player is fine and mostly unchanged from the s60 v5 version. The app ""Podcasting"" is missing for some reason. Now to handle podcasts via an application, it must be through paid apps which are less capable than the previous Nokia Podcasting app. None are rated highly, and reportedly contain bugs. I download podcasts via RSS feeds in Nokia Web or Opera which suffices for now. Comparison: the iOS music player is much better since it all evolved from an iPod eg, podcasting & smart playlists (maybe I can do this with the e7 but its still a little new to me). Also, no stereo speakers like n95, miss that.But, no stereo speakers. So in this way it doesn't match the n95.VOLUME ROCKER:I didn't know a volume rocker could be made which was stylish & easy to use. I like it!OS:Anna makes vast improvements on menu and option access IMHO (compared with the n95). Contextual menus are more predictably formatted, which is a big stride (similar to the way File and Edit menus tend to be across apps and OS's). Cut/paste nearly ubiquitously throughout the the OS. Also, no issues needing to reboot daily as others mention, or any of the other problems. I guess Anna fixes all that.Menus are still somewhat deep, more like a computer than other smartphones or PMP devices. Navigating the menus can get a little tiresome. But this is also a plus since I like hierarchically organizing my junk.I hear comparisons to iOS and honestly I don't know what the big deal is with iOS. iOS appears a bit snappier sometimes with screen rendering. Also, Netflix works on iOS which is a plus. BUT, basic user choices with how applications work, file system, visual display/theming, etc have all been in Symbian since the beginning as I recall, which iOS doesn't have. Other comparisons: WebOS is more creatively, functionally, and aesthetically designed than all other mobile OS's so no comparison there (too bad Nokia didn't partner with HP instead of MS since I think WebOS is the best smart phone OS). Android devices seem to have even more options, but often lag, and also lack in the visual experience of the OS. So far I have not experienced lags or issues reported by other users. So, for me, Symbian is great.** BOOM **HDMI outSmoking hot. Seriously I watched a digital movie on my 42in 1080p by mounting it from USB flash drive via the phone.** BOOM **USB on the goplugging in a flash drive automatically opens the drive and there's an app in the menu that lets you either backup the phone or exchange/replace data. Haven't tried it yet though.** BOOM **OVI Maps.This is one of the best features of the phone. It's clearly as good as a TomTom or Garmin, better than Gmaps, very fast, loads of options. My n95 sadly was one of those with a semi-borked GPS chip so I cannot compare this feature. Also, you can dl maps and navigate with the data connection turned off. Full GPS apparently. All free. I don't know if that helps justify a purchase but it seems unusual for a cell to have.INCLUDED SOFTWARE:1. QuickOffice. I'm not sure if this is standard, but it comes on mine. Nice.2. Mail for Exchange. Gmail isn't fully integrated (cannot star or make important, etc) but it is very fast via MfE. MfE is customizable. Haven't tried the Gmail app itself though. It would be nice if MfE or Google would integrate the GoogleDocs and GoogleVoice features into MfE as I'm a heavy user of both (at least on my laptop).3. Nokia Web browser is much improved from the n95 (s60). Still not as good as the Android browser or Opera; but still much improved. It is slightly slow on starting occasionally.4. Photo Editor & Video Editor - love them. Very feature rich.OTHER SOFTWARE I SUGGEST:Nokia - Internet Radio / Sports Tracker / Panorama (cool app to stitch together photos into one giant photo))Non-Nokia - Fring / Trapster / Opera / Upcode / WordPressISSUES:1. On startup, Ovi thinks I don't have an account. Seems like it should recognize I'm already a member. What's up with that? (fixed: just sign in and check the remember me box)2. Battery life is generally good for me; I don't have issues others on here have had. I did find situations which destroy the battery though:Wi-fi (especially if driving around - either turn it off or no juice)Maps (get a car charger for sure, and a dash mount because this thing is equivalent to GPS, works off network too if you've dl'd a map)Fring (pummels battery if not connected to strong wi-fi) though imho Fring rocks.3. Sending 8mp pics as MMS via Tmo? Cough. 15 min later ..... Tmo does NOT play with large pics for some reason. Had enormous problems with the n95 & Sony Ericsson Equinox too. This phone is no different. Thankfully if you want to send a pic you can choose email from the send menu (good integration) and when I send via Gmail it takes like 2 seconds. Tmo needs to figure this one out since I know it's not the phone's problem.WISHES:1. In comparison to my old (and awesome) n95:a) speakers are not as good as n95 (which was stereo)b) I miss the ""Gallery"" which was kind of like a rotating Coverflow of images and video (seriously, I think Nokia came up with it before other companies)c) focusing camera (n95 had a phenomenal camera, tad slow compared to other cell cameras, but awesome)d) music management, the old Podcasting application is gone and sort functions (date, size, etc) aren't as good as n95 for some reason2. More font sizes. Of the three, small too small, medium to large.3. Improved contextual menus: How about adding a menu item to the option menu with a row of common icons just below the ""Show open applications"" menu item (the top one in option/contextual menus? Suggested symbols: ""Exit to home screen and close application,"" ""Exit to containing folder,"" ""Close application,"" ""New,"" ""Settings."" Stick all these icons on one row so I don't have to scroll up and down trying to find Exit. Everyone understands these icons, in just about every format or every OS they're ever presented in. Close with an x, Home with an up arrow, Exit sign, plus sign. This type of menu would offer more functions in smaller real estate.4. Bring back bookmarklets in Symbian web browser. Miss. Them.5. No Netflix / Amazon video. It will play movie formats, just not streaming from Amazon or Netflix.This is one of the best gifts I've gotten in a long time. And certainly the best cell phone. I'd recommend it. Don't let my list of ""issues"" dissuade you; you haven't seen my extremely nitpicky Android, iOS, Windows, or Mac issues lists. Frankly, I love the phone. I don't feel trapped by a locked-clone ecosystem, I get a phone that respects me (gives me more control than iOS and actually feels more like a computer which I like), and is ready for my particular productivity needs, integrates with online services well and comes with nice goodies like the smoking hot HDMI out, great camera app, awesome Maps. Btw, no, I don't work for Nokia or the cellphone industry.I'll update in the future once I've got some miles on the phone.Month 3:I love it more now. Maps, QuickOffice, Fring,  good notification services, frequently called number scrolling widget (love this bugger). Maps comment earlier about pummeling battery...only if network GPS is used, dl'ing local map to phone doesn't squash the battery. Two office mates want one now hehe.More apps I recommend: Nokia Situations, Nokia Drop (love them both), Bubue ""Books"" (not from Ovi/Nokia store, but from Maemo apps page, so I'm guessing its a QT app).

B0046LTU9G,A2ZT1CSHU62UOL,SAH,"[8, 8]","UPDATE: 12/12/2011: I have been having trouble with the maps lately. It would not work no matter what. Also the phone died all of a sudden today.I have been using Nokia phones for the past 15 years approx. I have used 3301, 3510, 3510i, e63, e71 and now this. I also have used Android phone for over a year. So I can say I am not new to smart phones and definitely not new to Symbian. I have had this phone for 2 months now.I bought this phone because of my confidence in Nokia. They make amazing phone designs and solid build. Nothing can compare to the build quality on this phone. Nothing! The screen is big and very very clear. Keyboard is out-of-this-world awesome. The design is killer. You put this phone of the conference table and see the eyes rolling, it is that kind of a beast. So I give 10/10 points to Nokia for their design sense which almost all other phones (except iPhone) lack.Phone has a less powerful processor but that is because Symbian does not need high processing speed. Android requires a high processing power so those phones have higher speed processors. You will not find any delays on the phones but the whole Symbian OS is slow when installing new apps. Once installed, they run fine. The menus do not have any noticeable lag even with their animations.I'll put down the pros and cos now to make it easier for you to decide if you want to buy this phone.PROS:The KEYBOARD (10/10) is unparalleled. You will not find a better keyboard on a phone. Period! One thing to notice however, is that slide out keyboard is at times less convenient but on board virtual keyboard is there for you in such situations.GPS (10/10) in this phone beats Google maps by a long margin. It is one of the best navigation devices I have ever used, and the count includes GPS only devices as well. Remember, it is in a phone and what you get is a fully functional voice guided navigation through world largest map company, which is now owned by Nokia. You can have navigation speak in your voice or in many languages. You will also be able to use the GPS if you go abroad since Nokia has navigation and guided maps for a large number of countries, compared to competitors, that have it for US and Canada only.The SCREEN (10/10) is very clear even in bright sunlight. It is seriously clear. It adjusts itself so if you are inside it will be less bright but if you go to well lit area or under the sun it go's brighter. Many phone these days can not be used in direct sunlight. This one can be used without a problem. Clear black is Nokia's technology that makes black look like black on the screen. It is a really good addition. You will love the blacks on this phone.Best MULTITASKING(10/10). You can close an app after using it since all apps have an ""Exit"" option in the menu item which removes the app from the memory.One of the best EMAIL CLIENTs (10/10) that you can find on any phone. It almost looks like outlook in your hands. Very smooth, fast, efficient and connects with Exchange like a charm. You can have upto 10 Email accounts linked and you can set different sync frequency for each one of them. For the main Exchange account you can tell your working hours and the phone will remain in sync (all the time) for your working hours and then you can set it to sync every 15mis/30mins/1hour, as you like, in non-working hours. I think it is simply wonderful.BATTERY (8/10) on this phone is okay. It will get you through the day with heavy use easily but you can not remove it yourself.This phone SAVES YOUR DATA (10/10) since it downloads all the maps on your phone and then, even if you do not have a data plan, you can still use the GPS. It rocks! You will notice a decrease in your data usage once you shift to this phone.CONS:The BIGGEST(06/10) downside to this phone (and I hate to say this) is Symbian^3 which was later upgraded to Symbian Anna. I am not an Android or Apple fan for many reasons. One of the biggest reason is that you do not have much control on the device on Apple. Android gives you that control but it does not have good phone functionality. After all, what you want is a phone first. So, Symbian gives you a good phone with one of the best wireless stack out there BUT an outdated interface. It restarts often. Sometimes it gets annoying. I hope this will get better with Symbian Belle update but only time will tell. Symbian Belle is supposedly coming to the US around January (unofficial). Nokia will now be shipping phones with Windows OS so many people are afraid they will stop supporting Symbian but I doubt since millions of Symbian phones are out there and Nokia will lose their reputation if they stop supporting Symbian. I think they will keep up the support for at least 5 more years. That is just a guess.Many people use a lot of APPS (04/10). I don't! So I do not mind much if there is a pathetically low number of apps available for this phone. Nokia needs to pay banks, insurance companies and other giants to get apps made for them. This can easily be the biggest setback for many people. The installer was down right lazy and slow when I started using the phone but with Anna update and another updates few days ago, installer is better, much better!!!Overall, this is a great phone. If you buy it, give it few days and it will grow on you. You will not want to return it afterwards. BUT if you are app-crazy, this phone is not for you. This is a serious phone and helps in managing your work life like no other.",4.0,1321056000,"11 12, 2011","Nokia E7-00 Unlocked GSM Phone with Touchscreen, QWERTY Keyboard, Easy E-mail Setup, GPS Navigation, 8 MP Camera--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver)",249.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516%2BdiKaeFL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 56934},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

B004NLTWFG,AN81JUYW2SL24,Gearhead Mania,"[17, 18]","Nokia C2-01 Unlocked GSM cell phone (Quad-band and 3G)I was looking for an unlocked quad-band GSM cell phone for use while traveling abroad. The C2-01 is priced the same as some of Nokia's other smartphones that had a full keyboard (Blackberry style) but the C2-01 was the only one in-stock at the time. I wasn't expecting a whole lot after reading numerous reviews of other unlocked cellphones purchased via Amazon that yielded used/refurbished phones or phones that weren't unlocked.I was pleasantly surprised when the package arrived and my C2-01 was brand spanking new from the factory, complete with a NOKIA factory seal on the box. The battery was new, and the phone was in excellent condition. I was up and running within minutes, and fully charged the battery. I threw in a SIM card from another AT&T; phone and it was immediately working, no PIN or unlock requests, nothing. It immediately recognized the AT&T; SIM card and logged onto the network. I was unable to use the Internet or browse websites though, since I couldn't figure out how to change the access points properly. Even if I figured out how to access the internet, the C2-01 is ill-suited for browsing. The keypad is circa-2001 and the screen is circa-2001. It is very easy to use for phone calls and text messages (albeit slow due to the keypad design), and has MP3 audio capabilities.The micro-USB port allows you to charge the phone as well as access data. The AC adapter works in 120V AC and 240V AC outlets. A SIM card from China Unicom was inserted into the phone while in China, and it immediately recognized the carrier and changed the language to Chinese. The text and menu were in Chinese, this is great if you can read the language while traveling. But this is not so great when you can't read Chinese and just wanted a local prepaid SIM card to use while visiting! However, the simplicity and ease of use made the C2-01 truly worthwhile as a travel phone. The fact it can be used anywhere in the world (quad-band GSM and international 3G) makes it extremely versatile. The long battery life and simple interface for making/receiving phone calls are just icing on the cake!Overall: 4/5 stars. Antiquated keypad and tiny non-touch screen remind me of the late 1990s/early 2000s Nokia cellphones. The saving grace: long battery life, and automatic recognition of prepaid SIM cards makes for a perfect travel phone that can be used almost anywhere in the world.UPDATE: I figured out how to set it up for Internet access and as I suspected, the interface is ill-suited for web browsing let alone modern apps.",5.0,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",Nokia C2-01.5 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2 MP Camera and Music and Video Player--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black),119.94,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41P95kG27GL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 28373},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

I tried an Iphone 4S and had the same exact problems as it was the exact same phone with a different shape slightly as is the new Iphone 5 it seems lol.

I was amazed at how much faster, easier to use, reliable, better connectivity, better reception and much better Windows phone 7 OS was than the slow garbage I had been using.

I had come from the iXX and Android worlds and I really like the Mango system so much better! I'm not technical at all but I find Mango easier to use and the tiles just much easier on my eyes, too! The Lumia 800 looks just awesome in person; I'd say it's the best-looking black-color phone, ever! Its slightly elongated shape and super light weight and solid feel make it feel perfect to hold, whether for surfing or calling! The screen is bright and beautiful, and the touch screen works really well. I do need to get a screen protector, though!Two things I don't quite like, though: 1) it uses a micro-SIM card which is very difficult to find at low prices, I had to search around hard for a reliable seller; 2) the camera, while it has superb optics as it's a Zeiss, gives incorrect white balance under artificial lighting, while my HTC Radar has very good auto white balance. Outdoors, the Lumia 800's camera works wonders. Oh, one thing I don't get, which is not important for me as I don't use Tango and currently Skype, owned by Microsoft, is still not available for Mango, is there is *no* front camera. My HTC Radar has a VGA front camera but its picture quality is abysmal!The Lumia 800 does have quite a bit of storage. If you want to load a lot of media files, you should consider the HTC Titan. If you just want to download apps the Lumia 800 has enough storage for you.

B0067M9JBQ,A2UZ4PV7XYN016,Linh Nguyen,"[53, 61]","UPDATE #3: I just realized I completely forgot to mention certain carrier info. I'm using the phone with AT&T; in NYC. Doesn't work with their HSPA+ (yet? I believe there will be a way to enable the frequency) as far as I can tell but I get 3mbit downstream and 1mbit upstream, which is a-OK.UPDATE #2: Flashed the new 11501 firmware. Battery problem be gone! I unplugged my phone at around 1AM and left it idling. It's now 330PM and battery still at 58% with normal use from 9AM. Great job Nokia. I haven't noticed anything else other than the battery fix though. Added the last star :)-------------------------------------------------------You can love or hate Windows Phone OS, but you have to admit, Nokia sure stepped up their game in designing this beauty.HARDWARE:""Borrowed"" heavily from its N9 sibling, this is one stunning phone to look at. Poly-carbonate body means very scratch resistant and none of that slippery glass surface, unlike a certain smartphone. The curves also make it very comfortable to hold, especially over a long period of time, also unlike a certain square-ish phone. Speaker and microphone neatly at the bottom while micro USB port and sim slot are at the top.The screen is amazing. The 3.7"" Clearblack LCD (aka Super AMOLED or whatever you want to call it) gives you such vibrant colors that my retina-display iPhone 4 looks like a last-gen screen next to it, at least in terms of colors and contrasts. The touchscreen is very sensitive, though I've noticed it can be a bit jumpy at times. No idea if it's a software or hardware problem, or just my screen protector.The only problems I have with the designs are: a) the dedicated camera button. It's a two-stage shutter (slightly press to focus and fully to shoot) is a bit flimsy. b) the micro-USB port cover flips up and can easily be broken. And it stays this way while connected. (This has been remedied with the upcoming Lumia 900 btw.)Overall, this is the best looking phone I've seen in years. Kudos to Nokia for trying something new. And dare I say, they succeeded brilliantly.SOFTWARE:It's Windows Phone 7.5 Mango. You either love it, or hate it.Let me say that coming from Android/iOS, the first main differences I saw were the big and bold tiles, and the minimal homescreen. No gazillions of icons and folders cluttering up the screen. Everything is right there, in your face. Phone, SMS, Mail, Browser are all there and easily accessible the moment you turn on the screen. Very cool, I thought. But then, as an avid app user, I loaded up the Windows Marketplace. And boy, was I in for a huge disappointment. I'd known that this was a new ecosystem and there wouldn't be that many apps yet. But I didn't think that many of the iOS/Android apps (not games, don't care about those) that I often used wouldn't have an alternative for WP (more on this later).I was ready to return the phone. But then (yes, another turning point), I started using it. And I fell in love. The way Live Tiles work, instant updated info without loading the apps. The way ""People"" combines all/most of your social networks into one place. The way I stopped using my phone to do useless things and actually get stuff done. And of course, the way the Lumia 800 felt in my hands.  Also, slowly, I started discovering new ways to find the apps that I want/need. Sure, I had to compromise and discarded certain apps that I don't really need, but I did manage to gather a good number of apps in the end.Windows Phone 7.5 isn't perfect. I still hate the way copy/paste is implemented. I still think the keyboard is awkward at times and too sensitive at others. I hate that there's no jailbreak/root, or as WP users call it ""Interop unlock"". Or how background tasking has a 9-processes limit. Or how there's no way to change text size in SMS. Or that the default Marketplace is rather unwelcoming and harder to navigate. And many more. But these minor bugs and inconveniences all become irrelevant when you look at the big picture. Windows Phone 7.5 is a brilliant mobile OS. You might call it the smartphone OS for newbies. I'm guessing the reason why it hasn't attracted that many people yet is the lack of quality phones. We haven't seen anything that is so stylish, so cool that can actually compete with the annual iPhone and monthly Androids. Until now.I'm definitely getting a Lumia 900 when it comes out in a few months (though I'll miss the curved glass). Good job Nokia and Microsoft. You've won me over.Update: I forgot to mention that the 800 has battery issues (doesn't last very long). I hear that there's a new update out that has fixed this problem, but I'm still waiting for them to push it out to my phone. Will confirm when I get it.",5.0,1325635200,"01 4, 2012","Nokia Lumia 800 Unlocked GSM Phone with Windows 7.5 OS, 3.7&quot; AMOLED Multi-Touchscreen, 8MP Camera with Carl Zeiss Optics, Video, GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and FM Radio - Black",157.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41aeIRNRLtL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 14752},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

B0067M9JBQ,A2CI7I1V8PUZ70,Philip Skeete,"[4, 5]","Pros:This is a beautiful phone, it has that same addictive feel in your hand that the iPhone 4, it's hard to put down. I current carry an unlocked iPhone 4 on T-Mobile and a Galaxy S2 on Verizon. The Galaxy is clearly the fastest and spec rich phone of the three but feels cheap and I find android in general lacks the fluid UI of the iPhone. To my huge surprise I actually liked Win 7.5 more than iOS, I hated the old Windows phone OS's and expect more of the same. The newer version or Windows Phone is simply a new beast. Microsoft took all the best aspects of iPhone's simplicity and went one better with live tiles and great office integration. Its easy to use and very intuitive and the Lumia 800 just feel perfect in your hand. If you use Microsoft Office this phone is wonderful.Cons:My iPhone 4 works pretty well on EDGE data, and locking to EDGE I get two days of battery life and I very rarely find myself wishing I was on 3G. I found the Windows 7.5 on the Lumia seemed to have a bit of a harder time on EDGE. It also seemed to lack the insanely good signal lock I have come to expect from Nokia phones. The Nokia/MS mapping apps don't get by as easily on EDGE as the iPhone. I would not say it's a big problem, but I did find myself tethering to my Galaxy whenever I could.The other thing I did like is that this isn't a carrier unlocked device, the unit I received was software branded for Vodaphone Germany and had been opened and unlocked via an unlock code. I actually wanted an unbranded phone. I would have preferred to see this listed in the description and I would probably not have bought a branded phone as it has all the Vodaphone app links.Overall:A beautiful phone and a magnificent OS, Microsoft and Nokia are on to a winner here. I would probably say skip this phone unless you can get 3G.",4.0,1329782400,"02 21, 2012","Nokia Lumia 800 Unlocked GSM Phone with Windows 7.5 OS, 3.7&quot; AMOLED Multi-Touchscreen, 8MP Camera with Carl Zeiss Optics, Video, GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and FM Radio - Black",157.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41aeIRNRLtL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 14752},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

Holding the phone just feels so natural, very well made. The finish doesn't look cheap at all. I love the curved glass on the front, it makes swiping very comfortable and the display just melts into the phone. I think this was Nokia's last phone that deserves a place in Industrial Design museum. Overall I put this phone just below Google's Nexus and below (by far) iPhone.What I loved:-great design-battery life is pretty good-great display-modern Windows Phone 7.5 OS-usability and ease of use-internet share-connectivity with social networks-Microsoft Office apps-Exchange and Outlook support-touch-typing-all apps look consistent, unlike Android.-Nokia mapsWhat made me return the phone:-Windows Phone has no apps-some apps are just a good try but not what I expect from a smartphone (looking at you, Yelp)-Internet Explorer 9 is not what you expect in 2012, maybe 2005. Most websites render for feature phones, very limited.-multitasking is confusing-Bluetooth car stereo support is almost to none (most phones I had show singer and song when playing, this phone does not)-processing speed and memory is a bit off, when listening to online radio and browsing the web, the radio breaks up and stops, almost like the phone can't handle the streaming-syncing phone with MAC and PC is a complete JOKE. Couldn't sync with iTunes on MAC. Tried syncing with PC, worked first time, then gave errors.Again, this phone feels more like it's from previous generation and probably will be great for most people.

B00746GV06,A3PKHLXWYK19HD,gante,"[68, 72]","I had been using an iPhone 3GS for a few years (and have been an AT&T; customer in general for years before that) when I started to realize just how much I was paying for AT&T;'s service but how little I was using it, or the talk minutes part of it anyway. I had thousands of roll over minutes and hundreds expiring every month. I no longer felt I was getting any value from their service. I looked around to try and find some savings and realized that by buying my phone up front and bringing it to T-mobile, I could be saving $20 per month. The phone does pay for itself eventually.So anyway - I am supposed to be reviewing this phone. I have been curious about the WP7 phones for a while and was happy to finally make the jump. The phone itself is attractive enough and the additional software provided by Nokia makes their handsets even better than the other WP7 phones out there. The Drive GPS app is much more than I expected from preinstalled software. It has day/night mode, a good selection of voices, and speed alerts. Plus the maps are downloaded to the phone so you never have to wait for them to load.The hubs and live tiles concept takes a while to get used to, but now that I have adapted, I wondered how I lived without them. Hubs make the folders in iOS seem useless in comparison. And live tiles are like notifications that display on the individual tile. It is a very cool concept and well executed.I never thought I would use the FM radio, but the park where I go to walk has poor coverage by T-Mobile and I was not able to stream internet music there. I just switched to the radio and found an appropriate station with good reception. It worked fantastic.Also, the phone came with a pretty good pair of headphones, which don't seem to be included when purchasing from T-Mobile.There are few negative points to this phone: It is an international phone, so I was disappointed to find that the wall charger I got was the European standard and was worthless to me. However I was able to attach the cable to the USB wall plug that came with the iPhone and charge that way. Charging seems to be a little slow using USB, but I have ordered a proper wall adapter and hopefully that will remedy the slow charging.Also, the volume when listening to audio on the phone is good but not great. Although songs which have been downloaded through the Zune store sound much stronger than streaming audio.8GB of flash storage may not seem like enough to some people. My old 3GS had twice as much, but I never cam close to filling it. I am trying to force myself more and more into the cloud and having a smaller amount of storage helps that. I store my pictures on SkyDrive instead of on the phone and I use streaming services when possible to keep from having to download music to the phone itself. And I imagine that Microsoft will improve the cloud features of WP7 further as the platform continues to mature.Finally, apps. Before purchasing the phone, I had scoured the Marketplace looking for WP7 equivalents to my iPhone apps. I was not able to find everything, but in most cases I was able to find an equivalent that worked just as well. Some of the apps lack a few of the features of their iOS counterparts, but they seem to be updated on a regular basis and forum posts show a commitment to creating equal features across all platforms.So in the end, I am happy with the phone. It is not a perfect phone, but it is a huge improvement, both in the hardware and software, over my old iPhone.IMPORTANT NOTE: I became aware after using this phone for a while that it does not work with T-Mobiles 3G/4G network. I blamed T-Mobile till I realize that their high speed data requires a phone which operates at both the 1700 MHz and 2100 MHz frequencies. This phone can't use the 1700 MHz band. While the phone still does voice, text, and (very slow) 2G (EDGE, GPRS)on the T-Mobile network, you cannot take advantage of the high speed mobile data. Had I researched this in advance, I could have saved myself some money and both myself and the seller the hassle of returning the phone. I am not bad mouthing the phone or the seller at all. The frequencies it operates at are listed in the product description. I just did not do enough homework and was operating on assumptions when I made the purchase. I am sure it works in Europe and maybe even other mobile carriers in the US, but not T-Mobile. I still have this same phone, but have returned this purchase and bought one directly from T-Mobile.",4.0,1334534400,"04 16, 2012","Nokia Lumia 710 5MP Camera, 3G, 8GB Memory, 1.4 GHz Processor, 7.5 Mango, Wi-Fi, Micro SIM, Factory Unlocked World Mobile Smartphone - Unlocked Phone - No Warranty - Black",103.45,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41xYJmYUbGL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 21174},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

B00746GV06,A173YMJ9XFVRSY,SWD,"[15, 34]","My smartphone history:Apple iPhoneSamsung Galaxy CaptivateNokia Lumia 710The Nokia Lumia 710 is a serious downgrade from my Samsung phone.My reasons for changing phones:1) Faster download speed.  The captivate is for the AT&T; network; I moved to T-mobile, and my internet connection speeds stayed at 2G.  Which *sucked*.2) Android crashes.  A lot.  It's a great interface, but seriously, I wish it was more stable.Other than that, the Captivate is an amazing phone.  Great music/video player.  Great contact/calendar/to do list.  A lot of apps are available for it.  And, oh yeah, the screen is AMAZING.  Blows the iPhone out of the water.  The Nokia is a dinky little toy compared to my Captivate.Why the Nokia Lumia 710 sucks and makes me want my 2G Captivate back:1) (First side note) You will need a micro SD card for this.  My Samsung had a regular SD card.  To change phones, you have to go to a T-mobile store and get a new card.  Nokia has a micro SD card in the box with this phone.  But since the SD cards are different, it makes it difficult (if not impossible) for me to go back to my beloved Captivate.  Remember this before you make the switch.2) The screen display is terrible.  In any kind of bright light, you cannot read the screen.  Forget sunlight, this thing kaputs even in decent indoor lighting.  I can't imagine anyone being happy with the display that is not living in a fluorescent light filled home or office space.3) I hate Windows 7, Steve Wozniak's endorsement notwithstanding.  I hate that the phone automatically downloads people's gmail pictures, and shows them to you in the ""People"" tab.  Why can't you turn that off?  What if I don't want to see these people's faces?  (Do you use your phone to call people you don't want to look at on a daily basis: i.e. anyone other than a significant other or beloved family member?  Okay.  This might suck for you too.)4) There is no swype input (which is a free option on the captivate).  That keyboard is intuitive and makes typing very quick and easy.  It is similar but not the same as what Apple has on its iPhone.5) There are not enough apps for this phone.  Android had an amazing and vibrant marketplace.  This place is the restaurant deserted at lunchtime and dinnertime.  Maybe you shouldn't eat there.  It's deserted for a reason, you know.6) No customizable ringtones.  My captivate let me customize songs and voice messages as ringtones.  They had an app called Ringdroid which was the best thing ever that let me make my own ringtones.  Windows does not want to you use song clips as ringtones, or download your own ringtones, and there are no apps to make ringtones for this operating system.  Which sucks, because the default ringtones suck.7) Pictures folder.  Stupid thing shows your pictures on the folder.  So unless you want a never-ending slideshow of pictures from your pictures folder being used as a background for the pictures icon, you can't put your pictures folder on the first page to make it easily accessible.  If you take pictures on your phone for ebay purchases, paperwork, places and people you don't necessarily want to see everyday, or anything else, beware the endless slideshow of death.  And no, you cannot select which pictures appear in the slideshow.  The phone does it for you.  It's a feature, not a bug.  Like the ""People"" contact list.  Ugh.8) Fingerprints.  This phone picks up fingerprints like nothing else.  It is horrible.  My beloved Captivate had a beautiful finish which resisted fingerprints and did not get dirty and smudgy easily.  This Nokia bottom of the line crapfest does not do that.9) The volume button.  You will need to use this a lot of you want to listen to the music on your phone.  It is hard to push and set in too much on the phone.  It sucks too.10) The camera button.  This is, on the other hand, protruding too much, and is easy to press by accident.  Just holding the phone in your hand normally (as you listen to music, for example), will result in a push of the camera button.  If you use your phone as an ebook reader, you can also easily push this button.11) The default search engine is BING.  It cannot be changed to a Google default.  This sucks a lot.12) The icons are weird and not easy to understand.  I had one icon sitting on my unlock screen for three months before I realized it was for the mandatory live email address that Microsoft forces you to open so you can use this phone.13) Mandatory live account to make games (called Xbox games) and music player work.  Who uses live?  Really.  This mandatory sign up sucks too.14) There are two pages.  One is the home page with list of frequently used apps you can customize into tiles.  The second page is to the right, and is *all* of your apps.  There are no other pages.  So if need to get to the bottom of your app page, it could take a lot of scrolling.  Which sucks.15) Music player.  This SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS.  It sucks so much it deserves caps lock complaints.  You cannot make playlists on the phone.  It groups videos and music together, so if you have album covers on your music, you might not be able to tell the difference between an audio file and a video file, since it does not separate them.  It creates a visible tiled history of songs/videos/radio stations you listened to, which cannot be deleted.  Which I hate.  You have to sign up for and download microsoft zune to make the music player work.  Which sucks.  I've heard rumors of an amazingly good Nokia music player, but somehow that cannot be downloaded onto this phone.16) No world clock.  There is no clock for different locations you can put on your home page.17) No world weather.  There is no weather for different locations you can put on your home page.18) Timer/Stop watch.  There is no timer or stop watch function on this device.19) Audio quality.  Audio quality for music and telephone conversations above about halfway volume (halfway between min and max) is poor and static-filled.  As a phone, good audio quality is important.  This device fails at that.20) Product advertising.  This product is advertised as an ""introductory smartphone"".  So if you've never had a smartphone, and are upgrading from an 1980s brick, you might be really happy with this purchase.  Personally, I find being called the equivalent of a smartphone n00b very patronizing.  If my self-esteem suffered enough, I might even be forced to pick up a ""for dummies"" book, so that random writers can swear at my intelligence.  If you have ever owned or used a product called a smartphone, this phone is not for you.  Even Nokia is saying that it is not for you.  Stay away.21) Google voice does not work on this phone.  So no routing calls through your google voice.  No google voice voicemail.22) No visual voicemail.23) The advertising for the Lumia series of phones has revolved around the Nokia Lumia 900, which seems to be Nokia's flagship product for this link.  *That* phone is made with kick ass gorilla glass, which you could hammer and nail and not cause a dent.  This is not that phone.  The body is cheaply made of inferior plastic, and the screen is some inferior glass as well.  It will not be safe in your pocket with your keys, or in your purse floating free.24) Bloatware. The number of pre-installed applications which suck boggle the mind.  Delete them immediately when you get this phone.  All of them will slow down this device and drain your phone's battery.All in all, I must say, I really hate this phone and regret ever buying it.  It is incredibly poorly made, and frustrating to use.But, there are some good qualities about the phone.  Here they are:1) It has a radio.2) It does not crash as much as Android.3) For me, since I was upgrading from an AT&T; compliant 2G device, this was faster.There might be other good points.  I will let you know if I ever discover them.I wish the Samsung Note was available for T-mobile.  Such an amazing device.  I wish I had that product.  Or the Samsung Galaxy III.  Even with the crashiness of Android, it is a superior device in every way.  I made such a mistake by not making a Samsung phone my next phone.  Don't you make the same mistake as well.UPDATE: FEBRUARY 2013: WINDOWS PHONES DO NOT HAVE A CALL DURATION.  IF YOU ARE AN ATTORNEY, THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM.

This phone did come unlocked and works with a t-mobile sim card. I did purchase this phone new but like most users here I received it used with minor scratches and sadly only came with the charger. I did however manage to get some sort of discount for this condition. Above all this phone is great for any shutterbug. The touch screen is sensitive-- more so than my iPad2!!Now for the cons: not a lot of apps, which is okay! I'm not much of an app user. The only apps I really use on the 920 are facebook, gmail, skydrive and instagraph.that being said the battery life is pretty poor.

B009ZC90P0,A3NK28P0BSBJY4,Megatron63,"[5, 6]","The Nokia Lumia 920 is an excellent phone, but there were a few problems along the way. Let me explain...I purchased a glossy red Nokia 920 on November 9th (Launch Day) at the local ATT store. Personally, I wanted to give the yellow version a try, but the store only had the red, black, white, and gray versions available. So, I paid $450 for the red phone ""off-contract"" and also received the wirelesss charging device (black) at no charge. When I decided to buy the Nokia, I was upgrading from my trusty HTC TITAN (AWESOME phone, btw!) and wanted to experience Microsoft's new mobile operating system. Windows Phone 8 is a fast and stable OS, which offers some enhancements not available on earlier models. Setting up my phone was extremely easy and you are offered very clear instructions on the device. Most of the AT&T; employees I met are not very savvy on Windows Phone devices, so I made sure I was the one setting up the device at the store. Upon entering my Windows Live info, I was pleasantly surprised to find that all my contacts transferred extremely fast (took less than a minute to transfer). Apps and media, however, required more time. By the way, the excellent Zune software used on Windows Phone 7.5 devices is incompatible with this phone. However, if you have Windows 7 on your PC, you can use Windows Explorer to transfer media files. If you have Windows 8 or a Mac, there's an app for transferring media to your phone. Also, there are some WP 7.5 apps which are not compatible with Windows Phone 8. For example, the Xbox LIVE game called ""The Harvest"" is currently incompatible and won't even show up in a Marketplace search when you use the Nokia 920. Update (2/16/13): Some apps are already being ported over to WP8, so it will take some time for this to happen.After about a day of using the Nokia Lumia 920, I noticed the battery discharged to 50% in two hours. I wasn't using it that much during those two hours, but when I was on YouTube, the Lumia's case got extremely hot. This led me to believe that there was a problem with the battery, because my HTC TITAN never had that type of problem. Anyway, I returned it to the ATT store and replaced it with a glossy white version. Now, my new Nokia Lumia 920 works fine and doesn't have any of the battery problems found on the red one I returned. Aside from the battery issue on my first phone, I really like the Lumia 920!Pros:- Nice high resolution screen w/ Gorilla Glass- Solid and beautiful case- Outstanding still camera and video records at 1080p- Camera can be upgraded, using software ""lenses"". These enhancements bring additional features to the device!- Dedicated camera button- Great Nokia apps- Great Marketplace layout- Quality WP apps (Check out ""MetroTube"")- Good sound- 32GB memory- NFC compliant- Xbox LIVE games- Drag and drop media onto phone- Wireless charging is built-in (requires special charger)- Full PC/Mac compatibility- The SkyDrive app allows fantastic integration with your cloud filesCons:- No expandable memory! That is probably my biggest gripe about this phone.- Can't transfer or purchase Zune videos to the phone (at least, I couldn't)- Heavy (but its a solid device)- No custom alert or notification sounds (custom ringtones and alarms only)- Marketplace still missing some major apps found on other platforms- Wish it had a 4.7"" screen or larger, like my HTC TITAN (I do notice the difference in screen size)- No longer uses the Zune softwareOverall, I'm happy with the phone and have no regrets. I would certainly recommend this device to anyone looking for a Windows Phone device or a just a great smartphone.UPDATE - 2/6/13: I was asked if a data plan is required to use this phone. Well, the answer is yes and no. Yes, if you plan on using it on the carrier's cellular network. AT&T;, for example, will receive notification that you are using a smartphone to make calls and will charge you for data usage. On the other hand, if you don't intend to use it as a cellular phone and don't access the 3G/4G networks, you can use it as an Internet device. In other words, you can use Skype to make phone calls over wi-fi, continue to download and use apps, take pictures and video, and surf the Internet over wi-fi. I used to do that with my old HTC Titan (Windows Phone 7.5) without any problems.Bottom-line: Highly recommend this phone for someone who wants a powerful, ""does-all"" device! If you are tied deeply to iOS and/or Android and can't handle change, the transition might not be so great. However, five solid stars for this device!!",5.0,1353628800,"11 23, 2012",Nokia Lumia 920 Smartphone - unlocked - White,258.88,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DQ8lqVInL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 32818},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

For ease of use, Windows phone is really easy to use. For someone interested in a first smartphone, Lumia 920 is an excellent choice. I got access to few Windows 8 phones to review. I will try to review them, but since I have not used for a period longer than a month I am not reviewing for reliability. User interface in Windows 8 is very pleasing and this is one of best phones with awesome user experience. If you prefer great user experience over infinite hackability, aka Android, then Windows 8 phones are great choice.The Lumia 920 has a stunning 4.5"" IPS LCD, 1280x768 resolution, 332 ppi display. This phone has up to 32 GB storage and 1 GB RAM.  8.7 MP camera and a 1080p HD Video.  1.5 GHz dual core processor. I have extensively used in the past HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. This phone has Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of ""armor,"" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are ""stuffed"" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.Lumia 920 does not support microSD expansion. I always feel this is a bummer. But with 32GB it is plenty with current app ecosystem.  These phones seem to be copying iPhone philosophy.  Battery 2000 mAh Lithium polymer battery (Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery.) Unlike the Nokia Lumia 820, the Lumia 920 doesn't have a removable battery cover, which means you can't access or replace your battery. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__  For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design.  Wireless charging is a big plus, though!Phone quality was excellent and speakerphone was awesome. Nice to see built in active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic. Nice to see Lumia 920 has Bluetooth 4.0. Bluetooth low energy (BLE), known as WiBree,is a subset of Bluetooth v4.0 with an entirely new protocol stack. As an alternative to the Bluetooth standard protocols that were introduced in Bluetooth v1.0 to v3.0, it is aimed at very low power applications running off a coin cell. I was able to get excellent reception with Bluetooth headset,Jaybird Sportsband Stereo Bluetooth Headphone - Bulk Packaging - Midnight BlackandJayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight BlackAll the usual smartphone stuff, facebook, twitter, music, emails etc are all excellent. It is only the third party apps that are lacking in some arenas. If you are Microsoft heavy like Office suites, Lumia phone are awesome!Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. Lumia has GPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support. I tried with Garmin Navigon app which turned out to be great in giving voice directions. App ecosystem is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.ONE LINE SUMMARY: The Nokia Lumia 920 is certainly the best Windows Phone 8 smartphone on the market right now.",5.0,1368835200,"05 18, 2013",Nokia Lumia 920 Smartphone - unlocked - White,258.88,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DQ8lqVInL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 32818},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"
B009ZC90P0,A2WW57XX2UVLM6,Talvi,"[12, 13]","I've had two Lumia 900s, both suffered drops that cracked the screen (though they also made it safely through quite a few drops, I am a klutz).  So I decided to get the 920, and I am thrilled with it.  It comes in some gorgeous colors (bright yellow!), and it has such a beautiful and sleek form factor that I'm loathe to put it in a case (hence my blue Lumia 900's vulnerability to drops). It gets excited looks and questions wherever I go.  Last week I took it out during a meeting with about 15 of our marketing folks (predominantly young guys), and it ended up getting passed around the room with lots of positive chatter - until the conversation turned to apps.  I agree, it has most of the apps I want, but not all of the ones that I used consistently on my iPhone, and that has been the downfall of Nokia phones in recent history.The marketing campaign for the 900 was all about how everyone had been a smartphone beta tester, and this was the real deal. Followed closely by a software glitch bad enough that Nokia then gave a credit to everyone who bought a subsidized phone that made the phone FREE. There are still some problems with the Lumia line. This Lumia has had some rebooting issues, the battery life is still not great (you are running on vapors by the end of every day), and it's hefty. It fits in a pocket, but you really feel it, especially if you sit down.  All in all, however, I do love this phone and I love having something that not everyone else has.PROS*Form Factor: it's different, and gorgeous, and a conversation starter.  People want it, or want to try it.*Camera: It has a great 8.7 megapixel camera with optical image stabilization (Carl Zeiss, as always with Nokia) and takes good images even inside my house even with curtains drawn.  Sharp.*Screen: 4.5 inch screen with gorilla glass, stunningly sharp 1280 x 760 resolution and blur reduction.  It is also impressively sensitive.  Nokia is based in Finland, and they have 10 months of cold. Nokia engineers have been very motivated to make a phone that can be used while wearing gloves.*Operating System: The Windows operating system features bold, bright colors, animated images, and a very intuitive and easy interface.  I try to restrict my conversations with friends because inevitably people ask to play with the pretty interface and seem to have no qualms about opening my personal email, work email, and texts. I'm still not sure how much I like it that this phone is so attractive and attracting that it makes people forget boundaries.*Responsiveness: Superb. It has a dual-core processor, but it's optimized to run smoothly on slower chips. 60 fps screen refresh rate. It's zippy in most everything you do. 4G/LTE supported.*Maps: best in the business, and Nokia Drive is awesome. I used the 920 when I was in Chicago and it got me where I wanted to go via buses (I know, I'm cheap) every day with no issues (bus times, stop locations, etc).*Some sweet extras: wireless charging and near field communication. And they finally give you a way to resize your tiles, a lack that annoyed me with the 900. Also interfaces with my Xbox 360. I still can't set up my TV programs to record (via my cable provider) like I could with my iPhone however.*Sound: one of the things that seems improved - music quality is not bad if I forget my headphones and I can carry on business calls via speaker.*Price: a LOT cheaper than an iPhone.CONS*Size: heavy, big in your pocket and just slightly too big to be comfortable in your hand.*Battery: Yes, it's a jaw-droppingly beautiful display, but a little shorter battery life is the result.*Operating System: Still some glitches. Nokia did spit out the Lumia line pretty quickly after the partnership with Microsoft was inked, and they are still on an aggressive timeline.  The company is in trouble, and clearly is trying to strike the balance between getting this phone into people's hands while still maintaining quality.*My plea to Nokia: I want to see the time/date and notifications without activating the phone. I loved the N9 for that.

And I have a leather somewhat thick case on it. It is slightly picky about where I place the device to engage wireless charging, but as long as I'm just somewhere near the middle of the device, having the tablet oriented vertically or horizontally, it starts charging immediately. When it starts charging, my tablet (not the charger) makes a little beep (only if I have the volume up) and a small white light comes on the charger. I don't find the light too distracting, did take me 2 nights to get used to; I like to sleep in a cave, and while the light barely puts out any light at all it seemed like it was all I could see the first night. The rate it charges the tablet seems 100% equal to plugging it in, but I can't vouch for that because I only use it at night.This charger does exactly what I wanted it for. I want to use my tablet until I'm almost asleep, then just place it on my nightstand without having to pay attention to finding the charging cord, feeling for the proper orientation for insertion, then finding the port with my finger on the bottom of the tablet.

They both work to charge my Nokia Lumia Icon and my Lumia 928. The charging plates are however much, much slower than plugging the phone into the wall to charge. Also, the phone has to be put on the charging plate just right for it to take a charge. If it's not perfectly centered, then the phone just sits there with nothing happening. There is a blinking white light to get your attention if it detects improper positioning, but it is easily missed. Many times I have picked up my phone in the morning only to find it dead because it wasn't on the plate just right. Another (big) issue with the wireless charging plate is that it creates interference with the touchscreen on my Nokia Lumia Icon. In other words the plate causes the touchscreen to register false touch presses. If the screen is still on when you place the phone on the charger, the charger will often prevent the screen from turning off. You then are left with your phone always on because it thinks someone is touching the touchscreen. In fact, it will even open apps and start games by itself sometimes. I am assuming that the electromagnetic field that the charging plate creates is just strong enough to interact with the sensors on the touchscreen. Very annoying as I don't like closing apps & games or cancelling a text every time I put my phone on the charger. All in all, the charging plate is a nice concept.

B00A3NCBNI,A3HVU562SSVP8Q,Ms N. Boone,"[1, 1]","UPDATED:  I'm using it with my Galaxy Note 3, which WAS using the Docooler Qi receiver available here on Amazon.  It was always very picky at connecting, and since I didn't have the same problem with my Tylt Vu, I blamed the DT-900....and then came the day, I couldn't charge my phone on either Qi charger.Turns out my Docooler was defective from the beginning, and within months, it died completely - past any return window, of course. I replaced the Docooler with theUltra-thin 0.5mm Qi Wireless Charging Receiver Card Coil for Samsung Galaxy Note III 3 N9005 N9500 with Full NFC Support.  To my pleasant surprise, the DT-900 now works flawlessly, whereas previously I had to fiddle extensively with placement to make my phone charge.  I've therefore upgraded my rating to four stars - one star is dinged because they should have used a micro-usb port instead of a proprietary charging cable and adapter. Lose or damage the cable or wall wart, and you are out of luck.  I also didn't like that the proprietary wall charger it shipped with is white, when the charge plate and cable are black.While it seems common to have the charging plates much smaller than the devices they're charging (some I've seen are tiny!), as a cat owner, I confess to worrying sometimes about how my expensive, large phone overhangs the comparatively small oval that comprises the DT-900 charge plate.  Why?  I suspect my phone is one perfectly positioned cat leap from being catapulted (pun intended) off my desk.Overall, I personally prefer my Tylt Vu, but given how expensive it is, the DT-900 makes a great second Qi charger - or primary charger if the Tylt Vu doesn't suit your taste or budget.",4.0,1387843200,"12 24, 2013",Nokia DT-900 Wireless Charging Plate - Retail Packaging - White,33.9,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/110H64p58iL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 6414},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Travel Chargers']]"

The different colors of this charger mat they offer are nice, the cable that attaches the power brick is the same color too, but the power adapter itself is white...what's with that?The charging adapter you put under you back cover causes a slight bulge, and it takes pressure to snap the back cover on fully, but it does close completely.Definitely get this and that insert adapter if you want Wireless charging on your S3!",5.0,1368144000,"05 10, 2013",Nokia DT-900 Wireless Charging Plate - Retail Packaging - White,33.9,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/110H64p58iL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 6414},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories', 'Chargers', 'Travel Chargers']]"

So one thing to note about it, is that it does warm a little at times if the battery is really low and it has to charge up a bunch. However, the level of heat is really nothing to warrant any concern or even raise any eyebrows, simply making the case warm to the touch. I would assume that underneath the case, that the phone itself is probably warmer, but as we all know, any device warms when charging. Just saying that you might notice a bit of warmth when you pick it up.There is a slight few seconds of delay when you first place the phone onto the plate before it registers the device and starts charging, maybe 1-2 seconds at most, then you're all good to go, so don't be alarmed if it doesn't recognize the phone as soon as you place it down on the plate.  One thing to note that it seems to go into a dormant, or sleep mode when it doesn't have a device on it, so you don't have to worry about it continually draining power (for those of a &#34;greener state of mind&#34;).

Most of the apps that I used everyday are non existent on Windows store.Honestly, I really really love this phone except for one huge disappointment that I had to deduct a star. A phone with such exceptional audio quality deserves a dedicated music app, but it's missing. There is only the x-box music and video app that is so frustrating to manage. For people who use music all day every day, the music interface could be a big problem for you.Over all, this phone can do a lot of stuff that other phones can't. It's convenient and easy to use. I probably won't be upgrading for a while, I'll just stick with this phone until it wears out.

B00AR23T5O,A1ZU446KQF6T52,"Manzoor E Elahi ""meelahi""","[0, 0]","I am not new to this phone, I had to get this one as a replacement for another 920 of mine that got stolen. First I am gonna just put my original device review here, then get into this particular posting.April 27, 2013:The phone's review will have to incorporate bits from the OS too, so let's be done with that first. Live Tile remains one of the best interface innovation on any platform, the addition of a smaller size of tile makes thing only better. Ability to change tile size of any app depending on user's priority is simply brilliant. Nokia Windows Phones come with access to Nokia's full suite of mapping apps, although they are now available to others also, Nokia stays on top of the game by providing other exclusive apps like Nokia Music, Cinematograph, Storage Manager etc. Offline mapping data is a godsend. Added capability of apps' to integrate to lock screen to quickly provide you with info you care about the most is also awesome. The added accessibility tools like changeable font size, UI zoom, high contrast mode(looks freaking gorgeous) makes the OS the best choice for people who needs any of them. The usual goodies are of course still there.Onto the device itself. The screen size is 4.5&#34;, which in my opinion is the perfect size, not too small, not too big. The high PPI screen is a joy to use. It retains Lumia 900's slightly squarer 15:9 aspect ratio, and the increased PPI makes it one of the best display in the market. The curved display's edge meets the rest of the body flawlessly, making the phone a joy to hold. The poly-carbonate's texture is simply luxurious. The material also means that color won't come off even if scratched. Nokia has used a new kind of coating on the logo, and the three capacitive keys that makes it really easy to see them even when the back-light is off. Slightly raised position of the keys is also a very welcome change, makes it very hard to accidentally hit them now. The camera is hands off the best phone-camera out there, nothing more to say there. Although the from camera is less than stellar. A few issues that still remain is that I want the headphone port at bottom and the micro-USB port on top of the device, it has it in opposite order, although to be fair every OEM is guilty of this offense, except only Apple is now putting headphone port at bottom. At least we get a camera button with windows phones. The phone is indeed a little heavy. 900 is my opinion had the perfect weight. While 920 has better ergonomics, I find it a little heavier than I would have like. But given the built quality, OIS camera, display quality, 32GB storage etc. being a little heavy is easy to forget.Present, 05/22/2014:First let's talk about the software. Windows Phone itself has gone through several updates, three small ones (General Distribution Release, or GDR 1,2,3), and a huge one, Windows Phone 8.1. The phone I received came with GDR 1 installed. So being the enthusiast that I am, the first thing I did was upgrade all the way to WP8.1 developer preview. One very good thing about Windows Phone is you don't have to stay in the mercy of your operator, and wait months for an update. iPhone users do not suffer from it, but this issue plagues Android users to this day. A very important addition along with GDR 2 was Glance Screen, a Nokia only feature, that allows you to see your notification without turning on the display. After the last update it shows time, notification, and your next calendar appointment. Coolest feature ever. WP8.1 brings some much needed and requested addition to the platform.1. Cortana. If you've played you are familiar with the name. Microsoft really wants to achieve similar thing here, and they've already succeeded to great extent here. Voice recognition specially is uncannily accurate, even for a non-native English speaker as me.2. Notification center. Windows Phone has lagged in this aspect. But it's finally here, and better executed than iOS.3. Data, Storage, WiFi, Battery sense. Data sense helps you manage your mobile data consumption, Storage sense is for storage, Most curious is WiFi sense. It let's you connect to public networks without having to do anything, and let's you share your home internet with your friends/contacts without actually giving them yout wifi password. Battery sense enables you to fine tune each specific app's background activity preference.4. Universal apps. Chances are you are a Windows user. WP8.1 allow developers to write apps for both Windows 8.1 and WP8.1simultaneously. So you're gonna see a lot of apps crossing over.Point is this phone can be your gateway to this amazing update without having to spend much more on a newer device. 920 runs WP8.1 extremely well, and battery life is still stellar.Hardware is a very curious case on this phone. According to other reviews I gathered even though the phone comes unlocked, they may have been from a carrier. So I was prepared for whatever comes. And sure enough, the one I got is a device from a Mexican carrier, Movistar. But it's default language was English. Phone came with 4 keyboard installed, US, UK English, Mexican Spanish, and Portuguese. Unlocked phone does not necessarily mean unbranded, and the most annoying ramification is the splash screen I have to see if I ever restart the phone, and having updates the phone GDR 1 to all the way up to WP8.1, I've seen that enough for a lifetime. The good part about the device being of Mexican origin is the hardware category. It's RM-820, instead of RM-821 that I had before. It's good because the LTE frequency goes with T-Mobile LTE. It has, 700, 850, 1900, 1700_2100. I don't whey the underscore, but I get LTE now, so I am happy.I do wish the seller would at least separate the boxes based on frequency supported as those are written on the box, but all in all I am happy. This phone is still one of the best looking, best built phone on the market.",5.0,1400716800,"05 22, 2014",Nokia Lumia 920 Black Factory Unlocked 32GB phone 4G LTE,236.72,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZJ3dyCmiL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3025},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"
B00AR23T5O,A3S1VOR12LIV6U,"RWBurnham ""Rob""","[1, 3]","I tried using a few different Windows Phone 8 devices a few months back (Lumia 620, Lumia 820, Lumia 810) and they were good phones, but they were either buggy or too slow. Choppy audio, duplicate music files, poor music file tagging, unplayable podcast files from the Store, and buggy SD card support plagued all of them.Some of these items remain with the Lumia 920, but this must have an updated version of the OS, because things are improved. Audio no longer stutters and there are no problems with duplicate music files. Music file tagging is still broken, especially album and artist artwork, but I was able to fix most of the artwork via the MPATool app. The Xbox Music connection option does not fix any of this. It's actually sad that Microsoft's built-in music solution is such a huge step back from WP7, and it remains as my biggest complaint about WP8. Microsoft seems to want you to use their online Xbox Music service instead of CD rips.Podcast files from the Store play perfectly. However, you cannot manually add podcast files to your phone and have them show up in your Podcast section. If you manually add podcast files to your phone, they will show up in the Music section, which is strange. Sorting options are not as varied as it was in WP7.This is one of the few WP8 devices that has 32 gigs of storage, which is great for a guy like me who stores his entire music collection on the phone, and I download a lot of Podcasts. It's a shame more phones don't come with this much storage. I picked a phone with this amount of storage to avoid using a micro SD card.I bought an unlocked version so I can use my T-Mobile sim card. As of August 28, 2013, the phone has not received the GDR2 ""Amber"" update, which is a shame. Nokia's website says it's still in testing, so hopefully this phone will get it soon.Of all of the WP8 devices I have used, this one offers the best experience. The OS has some flaws when it comes to the way it handles media, but you can work around them for the most part. The rest of the OS is exceptional. It's slick, pretty, and has plenty of applications. The live tiles are really cool and give the OS a unique look and feel.The hardware is great. The screen is big and beautiful. The 1280x768 screen is crisp and clear. The phone is rectangular, but with curved edges. It's almost too big to be a pocket phone, but not quite. The 1.5 GHz dual core CPU makes for a very smooth user experience. Compared to my old Samsung Focus, all applications and games are noticeably faster.If this model received quicker OS updates, it would be a serious contender for the top WP8 device. As is, it's still an excellent phone.",4.0,1378252800,"09 4, 2013",Nokia Lumia 920 Black Factory Unlocked 32GB phone 4G LTE,236.72,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZJ3dyCmiL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 3025},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

B00B1O15C6,AO4DCU243V8AU,Ben,"[35, 35]","First, a little background, for perspective: I'm an ex-iphone user, migrated from iphone to Android a few years ago, for the freedom and open-ness of the OS. I've really liked the Android OS and the phones I've bought along the way. A few months ago I bought a Lumia 521 with a new Metro PCS account. The Lumia 521 introduced me to Windows 8 Phone OS and I was amazed at how fluid, intuitive and FUN it is - so I decided to fork out for a premium Windows Phone ... which is what brought me to the Lumia 820.The NOKIA LUMIA 820 is SOLID. It's heavy in the hand and has a stable, durable feel to it. The display is vibrant and beautiful. Reviewers and ""experts"" out there on the web can say anything they want about resolution, rag on the pixel density, whatever - but this phone, in your hand is BEAUTIFUL. Colors pop, photos are crisp and videos look great!As was the case with my (brief) experience on the Lumia 521, this is quick, nimble, FAST. Every operation is there when called for, tasks present themselves immediately and close just as quickly. There's something about this Windows OS that must be much less resource-intensive, less hungry than other mobile OS's, because things just pop and fly all over the place.The Tiles ... live tiles, that represent what feels like a living, breathing OS Interface. You see the faces of your contacts and friends rotating in and out of the ""People"" tile ... Facebook posts of friends ""pop up"" in live time, as they are happening ... News updates circulate in a tile, the tile suddenly flips over to reveal another breaking headline ... the tile from your Songza app suddenly flips over to say ""It is Friday Night"" (or late Saturday morning, etc.) ... the Photos tile rotates through your albums, scrolling slowly and continuously ... nothing stands still, this tiled-interface is alive!More on Tiles ... you can size and re-size your tiles, according to taste; regular (square), large (rectangle that covers width of the screen) or small (one quarter size of regular). You can even Pin your favorite websites to the screen, each in a tile of it's own. I've got four favorite Playlists (from Nokia Music) pinned to my screen, each re-sized to small, and they form a little music ""block"", the size of a regular tile!The Lumia 820 has NFC capability and Wireless Charging - something I didn't think I'd ever need or use, but I did fork out for the charging plate and it's been a very nice bonus. I've already grown lazy, with the ability to simply place the phone on it's back for a charge ... no plugs, cables or hassles.CUSTOMIZATION!  Unlike other phones in the Lumia lineup, this one has interchangeable back plates. Once in place, it looks like a solid piece of polycarbonate. You can make this a Cyan phone, a bright Red phone, Yellow, White or Black, simply by putting a different (removable) back plate on it. You can order these with or without NFC and Wireless Charging capability. This phone was black when I bought it, I've since changed it to Cyan (and have other colors on order).Is the 920 a better phone? How about the 928?  Well, the specs are better on those phones, but for me, this is the sweet spot. It's smaller than the 920, but with the same screen size, and (again), with the joy of body / color customization. Processing speed? System RAM? What are those??? What do I care? When a phone is as fast, fluid, stable and zippy as this is, who cares?  When you get a phone that performs as beautifully as this, you can forget about specs (and forget the ""expert"" opinions from the tech sites). None of it matters.Apps ... yes, you hear a lot of whining, complaining, hand-wringing criticism of the Windows app store and it's ""horrible dearth of apps"". If you believe what you read out there on the internet, you probably figure they've got about 10 or 20 apps in the store. I don't know WHO these people are, or WHAT they have on their own phones, but inasmuch as the Windows store has over a hundred thousand apps (126,000 as of last night) ... I feel that is enough for me (and for any reasonable person). Sure, you can bolster your app store to a million, 50 million, a billion, whatever - but when 50,000 of those apps are flashlights (as opposed to one flashlight), how is that improving your app experience?The 8GB of internal space ... once the OS requirements are subtracted, you've got about 5 or 6 gigs to yourself. Unlike it's bigger brethren in the Lumia family, this one comes with a Micro SD slot. I've got a 32GB card in mine, and have set the phone to load all photos, music and videos to the card (rather than to internal storage). That should hold me for awhile.The Camera ... with Carl Zeiss optics and Dual LED Flash,  the 8.7 megapixel camera and quality of your photos will be excellent. I've also loaded an HDR app from the store and have experimented with it, garnering some very nice results. I've been taking photos for Instagram, Foodspotting, Facebook and Twitter so far, nothing that requires a critical eye or instrument. I have also set my phone to auto-upload all photos and videos to Skydrive, so I've got an instant backup of everything I've taken.I'm not going to spend any time hashing-out or ""reviewing"" technical details, you'll get plenty of that in other reviews (and websites).

I don't want to pay a high price, but I wanted a newer phone (I was on a cracked Samsung GS for 2 1/2 years).  So, getting more tech for less was important and this was the best compromise (1/2 the price of the Samsung GS4 mini and I don't want a billboard in my pocket, ya know).Nokia delivered!  They're trying hard to keep up with Google and Apple.  WP8 leaves some major gaps, but those will be filled by vendors as the app store develops as well as MS when they mature the OS.  Still, I'm pretty blown away with the tech and OS.  If it weren't for the lack of apps, I'd never think about going back to Android, but the lack of apps is a headache for WP8.  Some minor integration issues that I'm used to (dialing a number and getting a name, for instance) are a problem, but the way WP8 imported all my contacts from the cloud made that tolerable.You can read many more detailed reviews, but from someone who could use Android pretty well and was willing to stay on the leading edge of yesterday with an old, cracked phone that wouldn't die, I will say that WP8 is a nice way to update my tech without paying a lot of money.  For the price I paid, I'd do it again, and WP8 is very serviceable.  Once the app store starts rolling, Android and iOS may be in for a run.

Then the camera has nice touch-to-focus option but some of the photos have noise, the video quality is very nice and has also auto-focus option.

Just a great phone for a great price, or so I thought.It began to act glitchy the first month. I thought it was a fluke, so I did a factory reset and it seemed to behave fine again. Until I took it to Central America. Nokia's are known as global phones, so I figured I'd have no problem using this phone abroad. Wrong.When I got south of the Equator, things went haywire. The phone would not detect networks, and would not connect when they were detected. It would power off and on randomly, sometimes several times in a minute. The time and date were constantly being reset incorrectly, even when I manually input the time and date. The battery would not hold a charge. Wifi calling was a nightmare--sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. I'd be able to get and receive messages...sometimes...with the wrong time and date stamp. It was just acting...bonkers. The phone did not work correctly for the duration of my trip. I spent hours fooling with the SIM and battery and googling troubleshooting steps. Nothing helped.So I made several attempts to troubleshoot/repair the phone...and this is where Nokia loses major points with me...although the phone was well under warrantly, Nokia jerked me around for a month before accepting the phone for repair, only to advise me that the humidity in CA must have tripped the moisture strip behind the battery and therefore voided my warranty. Groan. Prior to that, Nokia repeatedly told me to return to the retailer or the carrier. Neither of those companies REPAIR phones, though, and once you're out of the 30-day return period, well then you're just out of luck.So now I'm stuck with a phone that's DOA and no hope of ever seeing my $150 back.

B00COYOAYW,A1MXFGQRPSX133,B. Yamamoto,"[1, 1]","I have to post a little disclaimer before I get into the review, I'm a bit of a tech junkie and my primary phone is an iPhone 5S and before that was a nexus 4 (1.5 ghz quad core, running Android 4.3 - sold it before 4.4 Kit Kat was released), so my thoughts on the Lumia is compared to my past and current high end phones.That being said, the Lumia 521 has far exceeded my expectations!Software:The first thing that caught my attention was how surprisingly fluid this phone is for a 1 ghz dual core phone. It is more fluid than the nexus 4 and just as smooth as the iPhone 5S; it just goes to show how amazing the software is optimized. You would think this was a higher clocked quad core phone! The live tiles are pretty useful as I don't have to dig deep into apps to find info, like the weather for example. The customizability isn't as good as the Android platform but on par with iOS, because well, Apple doesn't let you change much unless you are jail broken. I believe the engineers for Microsoft is on par with Apple.Hardware:The Lumia 521 has a 1 ghz dual core Snapdragon S4 plus processor with 512 mb of RAM. It has lower end specs in the smartphone world but it doesn't show it when you're scrolling and going through different apps.Camera:First off, I use my iPhone for pictures, which is among the top two (Lumia 1020) so it further makes the 5 megapixel camera on this phone seem sub par, but takes decent photos in a well-lit environment, keyword: well-lit. That was one of the gripes I had with this phone, that it doesn't have a flash. The video cam takes 720p video and actually fares well. The Nokia Smart Cam takes a series of rapid fire photos and has features like best shot, remove moving object and change faces. The change faces feature is really useful. You can actually change just the face and keep the background the way it is in case someone blinked or like another smile better. Overall, it's just okay, nothing to write home about. Another thing it lacked was a front facing camera so if you video chat, you might want to look elsewhere.Apps:Yes, their App Store is pretty limited compared to iOS and Android. It does however has a lot of useful apps like Microsoft Office and the weather channel. I expect it to continue to grow as the popularity grows.Connectivity:One thing that this phone lacked that is fairly common in smartphones is LTE connectivity. It is limited to HSPA+ 21 which is plenty fast for web browsing. Hey, they had to cut corners somewhere for this price point.Battery:It has a relatively small 1430 mAh battery but the software is very well optimized for minimal battery usage. You can enable a battery saver feature that kicks in at around 30% charge. I easily got a full day out of it, 28 hours to be exact. Since the battery is small, it charges very fast, roughly 2, maybe 3 hours to fully charge.Overall:My overall impression is like mostly all of the reviews, a GREAT value. Probably the best bang for your buck in terms of lowest price (competes with the Nexus 5; 2.3 ghz quad core - but that's around $350) and I managed to nab one for $69.99. I gave this 4 stars for lack of LTE and a flash for the camera.

B00COYOAYW,A2SZLNSI5KOQJT,Carrie,"[407, 432]","ORIGINAL REVIEW:I thought about waiting on the Lumia 925, but after reading how much the Lumina 521 has to offer, I decided that since I tend to change phones about every 2 years, it made more sense to go with the phone that was lighter on my wallet. After finding that my local WalMart had one phone left, I snagged it and haven't regretted my purchase one bit.What I love about the phone:1. WiFi calling (set up instructions below) - calls are clear, but calls don't hand off to cellular network if you step outside of your WiFi range2. Tethering Capable (must add to your plan as a separate service, but no charge)3. MicroSD slot (up to 64GB)4. Camera is touch adjustable5. Adjustable font size6. Ability to have a high contrast screen (for those with poor eyesight or someone who wants a cool looking screen)7. Transfer My Data App makes switching phones super easy - even transfers text messages8. All of the Nokia app collection for free (drive, music, photobeamer, yousendit, etc).9. Touchscreen is very responsive - sensitivity is adjustable10. Visual voicemail (free, but have to enable your account)The few negatives:1. Camera isn't fancy, but is 5mp. Use fingers/touchscreen to zoom. There is not a flash, so indoor pics can be blurry.2. Phone supposedly won't be able to access the LTE network if available in your area. I haven't confirmed this claim. The phone speed is fast enough for my needs, but I am not a gamer.3. Plastic back. Does it matter? Most people use a cover anyway.The OKs:1. Screen is nice and easy to see indoors. Sunlight causes difficulties. I have not tried a non-glare screen protector.2. Phone does not come with a headset3. Phone does not come with a car charger4. The ear sound can get tinny. I use to up the volume to hear on other phones. In this phone, I turn down the volume to get rid of the tinny sound. This is not noticeable when on speakerphone.I really like this phone - it has all of the features I want at a fantastic price point. If you are buying a Windows phone (and you should), this phone is a no-brainer.WiFi calling set-up: get wifi calling enabled on your t-mobile account (free set up), and make sure that you have a wifi enabled sim card (free at TMobile store).  Then do a hard reset on the phone (not just a simple update).  Reset is found at Settings - About - reset your phone. Once you do these steps, a WiFi calling button will appear on your home screen. Press it and choose your option (Wi-Fi Preferred, Cellular Preferred, Wi-Fi Only).EMail/Social Media set-up: was a Breeze. I set up Hotmail, outlook, Gmail, roadrunner and a business email. Facebook and other social media is also very easy to set-up.Font size & High contrast screen is at Settings - Ease of Access.Tethering is at Settings - Internet sharing.(This review is not intended to endorse a third party seller.)SOFTWARE UPDATE (news release 8/16/13):The Windows Phone Amber update--available for Nokia's Lumia 920, 820, 720, 620, 520, 928, 822, 521 and 810--includes Smart Camera, which promises users the tools to create higher-quality photos by taking a series of rapid-fire shots then editing the best elements of each image together, further bolstered by filters and effects.Windows Phone Amber also touts Nokia Glance Screen, which adds a clock to the screen when the phone is inactive, alongside indicators that depict the battery level when the device is running on a low battery, charging or set to silent mode. ""You can activate the Nokia Glance screen in the 'display and touch' section in Settings by swiping left to 'glance,'"" said Nokia Conversations blog editor Ian Delaney. ""Nokia Glance screen will be available for all WP8 Lumia devices except the Nokia Lumia 520 and Lumia 625, which have a smaller display memory.""Following customer requests, Windows Phone Amber additionally resurrects features from older Nokia handsets. Users may now flip the phone over to mute incoming calls and double tap the screen as an alternative to the unlock key.""The rollout starts now first for the Lumia 920 and Lumia 820 in selected countries as well as the Lumia 521, Lumia 810 and Lumia 928 in the U.S.,"" Delaney said. ""Exact delivery timings will vary by region, phone and operator, but we expect the update to reach your Lumia 520, Lumia 620, Lumia 720, Lumia 820 or Lumia 920 by the end of September.""UPDATE (12/6/13T Mobile changed their international features outin Oct 2013, allowing free data & texting in areas they serve (phone calls .10 unless wifi calling (wifi calling is free).  I took & used my phone to Peru & it worked quite well, both roaming on the Moviestar network (free) & hooking up to wifi.  I tethered to my tablet as well.UPDATE (3/28/14)I just returned from a trip to Vietnam where I used the Lumia 521 continuously both roaming & WiFi. In airports and other venues that had spotty or no WiFi, I tethered my phone to my tablet & to another user's tablet. WiFi calling provided free calls back to the states & using my apps, including Facebook, was a breeze.  TMobile's free international features are awesome (free texting & data, $.20/minute network calls, free WiFi calling to states, not in-country) and saved me hundreds of dollars.That said, I'm finding that I use my phone a lot more to take pictures, and the 521 only has a 5mp camera & no front facing camera.  The 5mp is OK & my phone has taken some very nice pictures, but now I want more & will probably upgrade to the Lumia 925 down the road (hoping for a T Mobile phone similar to the Lumina 1020).UPDATE (7/18/14)The Lumina 521 was resistant to its first fall into water, but after a longer second dunking, it died.  It died slowly in order to give me a chance to find a temporary replacement, but death was its final outcome (it survived 1 swim & multiple drops).  Since the Lumina 925 has fallen in price, I ordered it as a replacement. The Lumia 925 has an 8MP rear camera & is suppose to take good low light pictures. It also has a front facing camera.  It does not have the micro SD card slot that the Lumina 521 has.",5.0,1369699200,"05 28, 2013",Nokia Lumia 521 (T-Mobile),68.49,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41vJNsprbTL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 136},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories']]"

As others have said, the phone is packed with features, which is totally surprising at this price point.  I downloaded quite a bit of music and podcasts and have only used my 5th Gen IPod a couple of times since my purchase, because this works so well.Pros:- Intuitive and responsive screen- Great storage, and expandable to 64 Gb- Good music player- There appear to be quite a few apps, including free ones (don't have much use for many apps)Cons:- I'm not a fan of the screen colors (maybe there's a way to change it?)- I searched for several hours online and there doesn't seem to be a way to connect my phone directly to my car like my IPod does.  I know I can use a line in cord, but I still nipped a star for it, because it's ridiculous that Microsoft hasn't done this for Windows smart phones.

B00COYOAYW,ABVYGB2TKBO8F,"J. Donaldson ""Cal-diver""","[6, 7]","I didn't buy this on Amazon but I did get a similar price where I bought it (big box store). I've had it for 24 hours but I've spent considerable time so I do feel I have things to report. I will add more as I have more experience with this smartphone. I'm waiting for the T-Mobile SIM card so there are a number of things I can't do, like make calls!My personal reference is the iPod Touch 5th gen I've had for a year so you'll see some comparisons in my review. It's all I have to compare because I've never owned a smart phone before.There's no question this is a pretty good phone for the money. It's a lot more phone than I expected. But it has it's Pros and Cons.Pros:- Memory: I don't know why it was so well hidden in articles, specs, and reviews but this phone has more than 7.2GB of storage. About 4.2GB is available to the user. This should be plenty for apps. I'm adding a 32GB microSD card to store music, photos, and videos. So no problem with storage.- Removable battery: I can't tell you what a relief it is to find phones that still have user replaceable batteries. I'm not concerned about daily use and having a backup battery. What I want is the ability to drop in a fresh battery after a year or two when the original battery is losing it's storage capacity. All batteries do slowly fail. I won't have to send the phone back to the factory and pay the price of the phone to have it replaced. I see batteries for this phone as low as $8 on-line.- Display: While the pixel count (800 x 480) is well below my iPod Touch 5th Gen the quality is so close I think the 521 may sometimes be better then the iPod. That surprises me because I think the iPod display is exceptional. The 521 display touch screen is also very easy to use as it is quite sensitive.- Performance. I feel the phone is pretty snappy. The only time it seemed slow was loading web pages. That may be due to the 1GHz dual core processor, but it may also be due to not having dual band WiFi so I couldn't hook it up to my 5GHz WiFi router which is much faster than the 2.4GHz band.- Size: As I've been using the 4"" iPod Touch 5 for about a year using the 521 4"" display seems quite natural. It would be nice to have a larger screen but not at the expense of weight. To me the main thing is that it feels comfortable in my shirt pocket, and it does. It is almost the same size in width and height as the iPod but a bit thicker. If being thicker allows for a removable battery then I'm all for thicker.- Camera: Okay for daylight but quite poor for indoor shots. No flash doesn't help either. The quality of the outdoor photos is acceptable for posting on-line like Facebook. There is no front camera but I've had a front camera for a couple of years and seldom used them so this is no big loss for me. I really like the dedicated camera button on the side.- Phone: I'll report back here when I get the SIM card and T-Mobile plan. I'm going for the #30/mo no contract with 100 voice and unlimited data and text.- WiFi Calling: This is a great feature that should allow us to make cell phone calls through our home WiFi. Unfortunately I've learned that this still burns plan minutes; how unfortunate. It will compensate if our local T-Mobile service is weak at our house. I'm very much looking forward to trying this out when we get our SIM card and plan. I'll report back here in a couple of days.- Power button: It's on the side. Not a big deal but it just seems more natural to me to be on the top. I'll get used to it.- Volume rocker: One nice feature is when you click on the rocker while audio is playing a set of controls pop up on the screen so you can forward/back/play/pause from there even if you are in a different app at the time. The volume shows a number from 0 to 30 in the upper left corner of the screen as you adjust the volume.- Charging: Imagine this. A standard USB connector on the bottom. Not a special cable like Apple. I just don't know why Apple can't just use a standard USB cable. I charged the phone yesterday and have spent perhaps 8 total hours playing with the phone, downloading apps, cruising the web, listing to music, etc. The battery is just over 1/2 charged now.- Snap off back: It's a little unnerving to bend the back to remove it but it does easily snap sharply back into place. I wonder if it will weaken and come off to easily over time. I like the feel of the back on my hand. No fingerprint magnet here. The surface provides a little grip with its slightly rough surface.- Feel of the 521: The Apple iPod Touch 5 is a quality device, thin, metal back, and light weight. But it costs $399 and isn't a phone! The slight extra weight and thickness of the Nokia 521 isn't bad at all, and it costs $100 and IS a phone.- Buttons below the screen on the front: I'm very happy that all three buttons are capacitive rather than mechanical. I've had problems with the mechanical Apple iPod Touch start button in the past. I like having the ""back"" button below the screen as it's always easy to find. With devices such as the iPod the ""back"" feature is in the software and sometimes the back buttons are hidden or are placed in different locations on the screen.- Software: I'm a big fan of Microsoft and Windows Phone 8. I really like the idea of having Windows 8 on my desktop, my laptop, and my smartphone. The interface is easy to use and only takes a few minutes to figure out how to find things and customize the display. There are tons of apps and many good ones are free. Those that charge don't charge a lot of $. It is handy having ""live"" tiles that show things like the current stock market quotes, outside temperature, number of unread mail messages, and various other things.- GPS: I'm very impressed that you can download maps for free and use the GPS feature without even having a SIM card. I was able to select a destination and it will give me a course to follow using the HERE Maps app that came in the device. It isn't a Garmin. It doesn't auto correct if you take a slightly different course, but you can easily reset the trip and it will plot a new course. No voice directions. But still even if you spent the $100 to buy the device and just used it for a GPS it would be worth it.- FM Radio: Yes it has an FM Radio. I didn't know that until I was reading Help+Tips on the 521 and it was mentioned. I tried it out and it works. Too bad both AM and FM radio in Redding CA is not very exciting.Cons:- More than once I've set the Nokia Lumia 521 down on a table, not too hard but a little drop, and it shut off and rebooted. I don't know if it is just this particular phone. Hopefully other copies don't have this problem. In fact I'm returning this 521 today and getting another one because of this problem.- I've heard of others having problems with the phone dropping WiFi. This has happened to me just once.- Windows Phone 8, while adequate, is clearly behind in features. I understand an 8.1 release might have a notification capability such as can be found in both Android and iOS. No mistake though. Windows Phone 8 is fully capable.- Apps: There are many thousands of Windows Phone 8 applications, but still there are a few that I use regularly that are not available on Windows Phone 8. Alternatives are available but I haven't found any as good as the ones I've been using. This is true for just a few apps but they are critical for me.First Downcast is an awesome podcast app, not available on Windows Phone 8Second mSecure is the password keeper I've been using, not available on Windows 8Third Toodledo to-do app, not available on Windows 8- Another thing I really miss in Windows Phone 8 is something like ""folders"" on iOS. I use them to group things together, much as Windows 8 on my PC can group things. Not available on Windows Phone 8.- No easy way to adjust screen brightness. If set to Automatic it doesn't work well for me. For example in a semi-dark room the automatic feature turns the brightness down so far I can't read the words on the screen. The alternative is Manual which only allows Low, Medium, or High brightness, no slider for much better control. The way to change brightness manually is buried in the Settings and takes several steps to get there. iOS 6 wasn't much better but Apple finally fixed that bug by introducing the Control Center in iOS 7.- Voice control: It works and I've used it a number of times. But it is no Siri or  Android's voice features (I understand the Android voice assist is much better than Apple's Siri). The voice control can be used to make phone calls, start apps, or vocalize texts.- Calendar. It works but it could use a lot of improvement. You get a month view that you can't zoom, and a day view which you can scroll through past or future dates. I was able to include my wife's calendar events and set them to pink while mine are in blue. I read a rumor that this app is being updated soon.For $100 this phone could be purchased instead of an iPod Touch. If you buy it, stick in a $25 32GB microSD card, and don't get a phone plan, you've got a cheap alternative.Given the price I do highly recommend this phone.We have been using only feature phones for about 15 years. I've never wanted to pay the high price for the data plan to own a smart phone. Truly what I wished for was to be able to use a smartphone on the Verizon network but only use WiFi for data and not pay for a data plan. Then I discovered the cheap T-Mobile service. I bought this 521 as an experiment to try out the T-Mobile service. If the T-Mobile plan work well the three members of my family that have phones will switch to this plan which means we will be paying the same monthly amount but now will have unlimited data and text too. If it works well I will likely buy a better phone, and as much as I want to use Windows Phone 8 I don't think it is ready for prime time. I will likely go with an Android phone.",4.0,1381276800,"10 9, 2013",Nokia Lumia 521 (T-Mobile),68.49,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41vJNsprbTL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 136},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories']]"

I expected to be able to have massive storage on my micro-sd card, but the phone doesn't let you easily move/transfer/find/play music etc ... from the micro sd card.  It seems to want everything stored on internal storage (apps especially) which takes up most of the internal memory.4. CUSTOM LOOK.  It seems like it would be cool, but you have VERY, VERY LITTLE CUSTOMIZATION OF COLOR.  AS THE PICTURE SHOWS, YOU CAN CHOOSE (LIGHT OR DARK) AND THEN ONE COLOR FOR ALL TILES (PINK IN THE PICTURE).  Some apps (like the headphones icon in green) have a built in color, but I would like to make the colors look the way I want.5. I have had problems with G-Mail and full/proper access/sending basic g-mail.  The alternative google apps use the  m.google stripped down horrible mobile internet (no graphics and few functions).  Come on ... It is a modern system with a browser that is pretty full of features, but you end up often only having the minimal m.google access.  What year is this ???Not a 'con' ....

( something customers are weary to do not sure why ) Otherwise there are very little issues with this phone ( no MMS on wifi calling is one of the known issues customers call in for )Very nice smartphone for the price- If you don't care about having the variety of apps like Android and Apple its a great phone!,5.0,1381017600,"10 6, 2013",Nokia Lumia 521 (T-Mobile),68.49,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41vJNsprbTL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 136},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories']]"
B00COYOAYW,ABSYIF0ONC2AF,Lee,"[1, 2]","I got this for my dad. He's not technical and he doesn't care about installing more apps.[Good]Easy to Use: Just as intuitive as iPhone. In some ways it's even easier to use.Original and innovative UI: Unlike other mobile operating systems, it doesn't feel like a cheap copy of iOS. The Windows 8 tile UI is innovative and just plain nice. Of course like everything else not everyone will like it but it's original.The Best for the Vision Impaired: All text can be made bigger. Also, unlike iOS you can even resize buttons on the Home Screen. It even has a high contrast option. In my opinion this is the best for people who can't see very well.Cheap: You can't beat the value. It's stylish, functional, fast, and it's at a low price point.Pay as You Go: It's compatible with pay as you go plans. I'd say the Lumia's are the best phones for those plans if the iPhones aren't available.(T-Mobile only I think) Wi-fi Enabled Calling: On T-Mobile, if you have access to wireless internet; calls won't count against your minutes.It has all the core apps that you need: Email, Facebook, Skype, Twitter, a Web Browser, and more.Decent Camera: It's 5 MP. For the price, it's not bad.Expandable to 64 GB: You can add extra SD storage up to 64 GB.Good Performance: Pretty fast and I rarely noticed any lag. Then again I didn't even try playing games on it, even though Angry Birds is included on the phone.Good Facebook Integration: The phone seamlessly merges everything on your Facebook into all parts of the phone. i.e. All of your phone contacts will have extra data like pictures and email pulled from Facebook, making it one of the nicest phone contact UIs found on a smartphone.Good MS Services Integration: The phone seamlessly works with everything Microsoft like Skydrive and Skype.[Bad]There are very few apps compared to either Android or iPhone. Thankfully the main ones like Facebook, Skype, Google Maps, Viber, and What's App are available. If you like apps, this isn't the phone to get.Build Quality: While the front of the phone is nice, the back of it is all cheap plastic. I don't mind since it's a cheap phone.No Camera Flash: Pictures with poor lighting will not turn out well. It's an understandable sacrifice for the price.No Front Camera: You're not going to be able to use this for video chatting with Skype. It's understandable for the price.Extra SD storage can only be used by pictures, videos, and music: Apps are only limited to the 4 GB of storage that the phone comes with (yes it's really 8GB but the Windows 8 OS itself uses up 4 GB of it so you only have 4GB left to use). Only the videos and pictures that you take, and the music that you add can use the extra storage. This would be really bad if Windows 8 had a lot of apps. Fortunately (and unfortunately) there aren't very many apps on Windows 8 Mobile.Call Quality: It's horrible isn't great when it's not on speaker phone. Even when the volumed is maxed, I can barely hear anything.[Verdict]Personally I'm sticking to an iPhone for myself. If you're younger AND open to new tech then iOS or Android is for you. If you don't care about the latest apps and games or are firmly into Windows, this is a really great starter smartphone at a low price.This phone is just really awesome for the elderly.",4.0,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",Nokia Lumia 521 (T-Mobile),68.49,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41vJNsprbTL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 136},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories']]"

B00COYOAYW,A378PP2XVXKCIE,Mark A.,"[6, 6]","The purpose of this review is note the value added from this phone with respect to Zune HD and X-Box Music. In addition, I wanted to note that as I am using it as my personal media device, I can monitor the T-mobile reception.Currently, I have a ZuneHD 32GB that is attached to my X-box Music subscription which allows me to download my music and listen to them monthly without WiFi, although I never purchased them. I would periodically need to connect to a network to show that I am still a subscriber, but it works great. For those that are trying to do what I am doing, make sure that you download the song to the phone (and do not buy).As you can see, these devices are no longer supported and they have aged. This is where this phone comes into play. This device natively plays my protected music. I expanded the data with a 32GB microSD card. In result, I found a replacement ZuneHD, which is supported (+), with more memory storage (+), a decent camera (+), Microphone for WiFi Calls (check out the apps), and has a speaker. This device is more responsive and is cheaper than when I bought my Zune media player. I can check out YouTube and surf the web better my previous device.Just with the noted features above, I give it a five. So there is also the phone portion of the device.I do not have the service. I did not know if it would work in location that I would need it given the complaints that I have seen on the web. Well, without the service but with the SIM card attached, I can still monitor the signal strength! I have a minimum of 2 bars of 4G on where I need it. I look forward in using it in the future.Finally, for those that have an android phone with all their contacts stored in google, this phone syncs up with it!I have been completely impressed with this phone for the price. It is smooth.In result, the value of this phone is way more than what it is being sold. It is a great Zune/Xbox music player, with the ability to use wifi and surf the web. It is a phone, if I choose to use it that way.*UPDATE 11/6/2013*I am now using it as a phone. I am an android user and I am impressed with Windows Phone 8. It synced up with my Google contacts. Predictive texting is the best that I have seen (with auto-correct). I can now sync my Zune/Xbox Music. I think this would be a GREAT first time Smart Phone user phone. The learning curve is nothing.The drawbacks now that we are using the phone is that:1. MS Xbox Music wants to ""sync"" online when playing music so you will see a HARD lag with the phone. This makes me want to upgrade to a faster phone with more ram to see if this gets corrected.2. The 8 GB memory gets used up fast even though I requested everything to be placed on my SD card. It appears to be a flaw with windows phones in general.I still think this is an amazing phone for the price.",5.0,1376006400,"08 9, 2013",Nokia Lumia 521 (T-Mobile),68.49,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41vJNsprbTL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 136},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones'], ['Electronics', 'Computers & Accessories']]"

Downsides are apps for a windows phone are limited, so if all the popular games and apps are important then maybe reconsider.

On the Nokia side, the hardware and build is superb for the price. You wanna talk about plastic, grab a Samsung galaxy at $600. This phone is plastic but is beautiful.  I never use the front facing cameras so I don't miss it. The flash that is missing on the back can be made for, by adjusting the camera settings. I miss a lot of the apps from Android but they will come, give it a chance. This os is less than a year old.Update: not going back to Android anytime soon. The Windows Phone is has me impressed. I guess I grew up tired of my Androids lagging and freezing up all the time. I'm staying with this phone for at least a year. Most popular apps have ports via third-party developers on Windows Phone. Vine, twitter,tumblr, Facebook, reddit, every major app is there. I can't find good spreadsheet, vpn, PDF, programming apps though, but I'm a power user that buys cheap phones. Call me cheap, or smart buyer. But I'm willing to give all those apps up for this smooth phone. I still use my previous Android if I need to use those power apps, but this phone is my everyday workhorse. One major thing missing is that the browser can't save passwords.

B00COYOAYW,A7PAPE702B20U,Pmm368,"[4, 8]","After some debate if I should get this phone (since it's a Windows phone), I purchased this phone on the 24th October, 2013 at a local Wal-Mart for $100.  For the first 3 days I had this running, it worked great.  Over the last 4 days, this phone has been restarting itself several times (usually 3 to 7 times) a day.  Turns out the battery doesn't fit in the phone properly (little bit of wiggle room, causes the battery to come loose from the battery terminals on the phone).Pros:5MP camera.The pictures come out better than I thought, sometimes the photo comes out blurry but the majority of the time it takes pictures really well.  Shoots video in 720P High Definition at 10mbps.4G HSPA+Not LTE, but decent.  The coverage is great in my area and I get anywhere between 4 & 8 mbps download speeds.  The ping is usually between 80 & 100 MS.Mobile Hotspot.This phone allows you to tether your internet connection, depending on your plan.GPSBest GPS I've used on a phone.  The GPS I've used on any of my previous Android phones would give me turn-by-turn directions, but Windows is the only one I've used that tells me the speed limit in an area.  I can also use it to tell me how fast I'm travelling and how far I've traveled.  I had to install a separate app on Android to do that.Cons:Music.  Transferring music to the phone seems to be a pain in the rear.  I transferred music using Windows Media Player, but after I deleted a folder, none of my music showed up in my phone again.Battery.  As stated above, battery is fairly loose from the battery terminal on the phone, causing it to restart on me several times in a day.  It usually happens when it's in my pocket while I'm walking.Transferring files off the phone via online storage.  I installed dropbox, hoping to be able to upload photos to my dropbox, but I can only put it on my skydrive.  Videos can only be uploaded over WiFi to prevent going over your data package.Transferring files via bluetooth.  I have sent files from this phone to an Android tablet and it works good.  I can only transfer pictures via bluetooth, but not videos.Overall, I would've given this phone a 4 star if it hadn't been for the battery problem I'm facing.  I'll update if the company (either Nokia or T-Mobile) is able to fix this problem.Edit 11/1/13My phone has shut itself off 14 times from 10pm 10/31/13 to 7:30am 11/1/13.  I'm not taking a chance on trying another Lumia phone.  I was hoping for a more reliable phone for $100.Edit 11/3/13I returned the phone back to the store to get my money back.  Unfortunately, Wal-mart wouldn't let me keep the sim card, which contained my phone number that I wanted to keep.  I started a number port to my home phone, so I'm hoping Wal-mart keeps it active long enough for the transfer to go through.

B00DCXWBMM,A39KJOCZGCM8P1,Chris Lee Mullins,"[2, 8]","Bought this phone for my wife who was complaining about the complexity of the Android ecosystem. Really, she couldn't care less about multiple apps or widgets or rooting her phone. She just wants Facebook status updates, a decent Contacts app in a form factor that is somewhat smaller than the recent spate of monster-sized Android phones. (As an aside, personally, I use either a Galaxy Note 2 or a Galaxy S4, both rooted - she wants nothing to do with all that).This phone fit the bill perfectly. After a bit of a learning curve, she fell into a routine with this phone. Call quality is great. The keyboard is spot-on perfect for her smaller hands. She loves this phone.Well, she loves it when it works, anyway.Lately, this phone has been powering off at strange times. Sometimes it requires a soft reset to bring it back. Other times, simply plugging it into the charger is enough to bring it back to life. After a quick trip through the Googles, I'm finding that we're waiting for a specific over-the-air firmware update to resolve this problem.Thing is, that firmware update hasn't hit her phone yet. So...the waiting game.If your phone's OS is  8.0.10327.78, you are still waiting for the firmware update.Aside from this absolutely MAJOR issue with the phone's stability, its a wonderful flagship device for Windows Phone 8. Its really too bad that people don't give it a fair shake. Its not nearly as feature rich as a Droid, nor does it have as many apps as an iPhone. But there are just certain people out there who really...don't care about all that. They want the uncomplicated basics. Most of those people buy iPhones because family insists or have Androids foisted upon them by overeager Best Buy geeks.

B00DCXWBMM,A2QUQ94PAUKZHD,"Dwight Karlsen ""Desert Bachelor""","[2, 7]","I really wanted to give this phone 4 stars, but due to an extremely aggravating bug in the OS, I cannot. I bought this phone the first week it was available in the US, to replace my existing Nokia Astound (8GB, 8MP camera, Symbian OS). Mainly I wanted a larger, crisp screen and a more customizable interface, and of course a nice camera. WP and the Nokia Lumia 925 seemed to offer all of this, and indeed it does.In retrospect, I now realize that the trouble started one night in mid-September when I was exploring the different menus of the WP OS. I stumbled upon the very last item on the App list, ""Wi-Fi Calling."" I had never had a cell phone that was even capable of Wi-Fi calling, so I was intrigued. There are three settings offered: ""Wi-Fi Preferred"", ""Cellular Preferred"", or ""Wi-Fi Only."" Actually there is a fourth setting: Wi-Fi Calling ""On"" or ""Off"". I didn't really trust the technology yet, so changed the setting from ""Wi-Fi Preferred"" to ""Cellular Preferred."" Over the next month, a very aggravating thing began happening: I would pull out my phone to make a call, and get a ""No Cellular Service"" message. Or a message stating ""You are in Airplane Mode"". Or, ""Cellular Service is turned off, do you want to turn cellular service on?"" Reasonable responses to all of these messages never resulted in re-engagement of the cellular signal. In fact, I gradually discovered that the only thing that would return cellular service was to turn the phone off and then turn it back on, whereupon it immediately resumed its normal functions.I began missing phone calls from friends and relatives. Sometimes over a day would pass before I would realize my phone was no longer functioning as a phone. It was infuriating and extremely disappointing. I found myself apologizing to people who were trying to get ahold of me. Texts would not come through either, while it was locked into this Wi-Fi calling hell on earth. Naturally, the only time I got frustrated enough to take it back to the store was after I had re-booted it, and so it worked fine while I was at the store.I finally did some online searching, and actually stating my problem using ask.com revealed the answer: Choosing ""Cellular Preferred"" causes your phone to lock into Wi-Fi calling mode. I have turned off Wi-Fi calling completely, and plan never to use it again. It's not worth almost having a nervous breakdown over. I want to like this phone, but right now it is in the dog house, and it's going to have to work to earn my trust back.",3.0,1383782400,"11 7, 2013",NOKIA LUMIA 925 WHITE 16GB RM-892 FACTORY UNLOCKED LTE 4G 3G 2G (2G &amp; 3G HSDPA 850/900/1900/2100 &amp; 4G 800/900/1800/1900/2100/2600),289.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41geMPK25FL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 9867},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

And the phone's 8 MP camera actually puts out some very nice snapshots that you won't mind sharing on Facebook or via the now-available Instagram.The phone's performance is &#34;peppy&#34; and I have not noticed any slow down at all.

Yeah, you can do ctrl-q, but that's not really what the developers intended (which is odd).The Windows Phone 8 store doesn't have as many games as say, the iOS or Android ecosystems, but what is there is not bad.

She would always complain about blurry pictures because she couldn't hold the camera steady enough with one hand, but now picture time is much easier.

I only wish the phone used induction charging from the grip to the phone because I'm afraid someone will detach the phone incorrectly and break the charging port.

I got Lumia 520 (ATT) as a backup phone (just in case, if we lose or break our phones), since it was on sale for $59.00 with FREE Incipio case (+ FREE shipping). I didn't expect too much, but I knew that Windows Phone OS will be smooth on the low spec phones. But when I received it and used it for few days, I can only say, ""WOW."" This is the best entry smartphone - including all entry level Android phones. Now make no mistake, this is not a high end phone. But this is very capable entry phone for all your needs. You can read excellent online reviews for Lumia 520, so let me just mention few excellent qualities of Lumia 520:1. PRICE. As of now, Amazon sellls it for $54.99. That is incredibly cheap. Just to give you a comparison, Sansa Clip+ MP3 Player (8GB) is $49.00 in Amazon. But Lumia 520 does so much more than playing your music. It has Nokia maps, drive+, etc, you can browse the web, email, set calendar for your appointments. You can take pictures, you can call & text. You can read ebooks, you can do MS Office (preloaded), and so much more. So for $54.99, you are getting a mini-computer at your disposal. At this price, it is bargain.2. WINDOWS PHONE OS. If you are used to WP OS, then you already know how smooth, simple, and useful it is. But if you are thinking about WP, then Lumia 520 is an excellent choice (if you don't mind its low spec) for you to try it out since it is so cheap, you will still experience buttery smooth OS that makes your life organized and entertained. Lumia 520 is preloaded with WP 8, but you can easily upgrade it to WP 8.1 and Lumia Black. Sure it is not as fast as high end WP (ie, Lumia 925, HTC 8X, etc), but it is decent. It is smooth. NOTE: If you want to sync with Windows Phone with your contact list, email, calendar, etc.., it is BEST to use Windows Live Mail (FREE email client from Microsoft). It will always sync with your desktop/laptop with your phone.3. FUNCTIONALITY: call is clear, speaker is loud enough, screen (IPS LCD) is bright & clear, but it is finger print magnet (but this is greatly reduced by putting on screen protector - Illumishield product). Memory can be expanded by Micro SD card - where you can store: maps, music, pictures, apps, and documents. Bluetooth (version 4.0) works flawlessly. The screen is responsive even with the gloves on. No front facing camera, but I don't do selfie - so it doesn't matter.In sum, this is the best entry smartphone you can buy. You cannot beat this price with this much quality.

B00E45043A,A4WYCW63XR1UU,"Amazon Customer ""biz""","[0, 5]","I had been curious about the latest Windows phones. I am looking to move from the Android world as Google's latest version of Android is both more invasive (in terms of privacy) and really a step towards the mediocrity that often happens when management changes in the technology group responsible for the device. In this case, the stellar vision of Andy Rubin has been replaced by the more middle of the road corporate manager who shipped Chrome OS to the world. That's started to show in Android and thus, it is time to look at alternatives.As this phone was offered on a pre-holiday discount, I decided to take a risk and try it as opposed to joining the Apple side of the force.I was extremely disappointed. I found the tile based interface somewhat too constricting. Due to the unwanted AT&T; supplied crapware (one of these days carriers will realize that their business is to provide connectivity/bandwidth and leave apps and app-based services to those who know what they are doing), I wound up going through the settings to customize the phone. While there were some that were useful, some were just missing and thus I could not eliminate things I had no need for or no desire to pay the battery/bandwidth freight for.In the end, I simply powered off the phone and put it back in its packaging. There was absolutely nothing in the software that was in any way compelling at all. On top of that, the app store was a bit thin in terms of functionality. The final bit of missing functionality was tethering - always present in Android phones and an option for Apple phones. Without tethering, you really can use a phone if you have any other mobile devices you travel with that would benefit from WAN access.The 1 star is for the physical design: good form factor and fits in your hand well. Not so good on the buttons and battery though.Microsoft needs to pay more attention to users and less to carriers. I can see that they are trying to woo the carriers with all sorts of opportunity to add software from the carrier and brand it appropriately. The problem is, no one wants that software.I might have had a different experience if I'd received and unlocked Windows 8 device with pure Windows 8 on it (i.e like Android on a Nexus device from Google, or any iPhone with iOS).So, misses not just by miles but by parsecs.",1.0,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",Nokia Lumia 520 GoPhone (AT&amp;T),48.04,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oUm2c3OtL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 66},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"

An inexpensive Android phone can be glitchy and require a geek's touch to operate.

I was an original iphone adopter and stuck with it for years of upgrades, then switched to Android with a HTC One X. Unfortunately, my HTC died on my 17 months into my contract. That left me trying to decide if I wanted to pay my ETF and switch carriers, or pay a hefty upgrade fee, or just get an el cheapo phone until something else came up (like the next Galaxy Nexus which may be offered at a cheap price). I went to my local AT&T; to see what the cheap options were and it was a pretty bad set of choices. Generic flip phones that are useful to just make calls (I need IM and web capability for work). And an android phone for $80 that was terrible, laggy and slow. And then there was this phone.I don't know how they do it. My only guess is that this phone is sold at a loss in an attempt to lure you to windows mobile. I can't fathom how they could build this phone and sell it for $100. No, it's not an amazing phone, but it's a darn good one especially for $100. None of the specs are top notch, obviously, but it works and it works well. It's responsive, fast and reasonably good looking. Replaceable battery and SD card slot? Most android phones aren't even doing that anymore. Oh hey, bluetooth AND 4G?!?!?! Woah baby.My only real gripes are with the OS. If this is your first smartphone you'll probably have no complaints. If, however, you're coming from Android or iOS, you'll notice the lack of apps in the app store. Yes the big things are there, but if you're heavily invested in google service you'll probably be disappointed. On the plus side, the native tools sync with google contacts, mail and calendar pretty darn well. But google music, maps, keep, etc? No sir (there are some apps that work ok-ish). Also compared to Android there are a distinct lack of web browsers (there are a few, but they all use the same IE engine it looks like, no firefox or chrome), alternate keyboards, mail clients, SMS clients, etc etc.But bottom line, for $99 it will get the job done and do it pretty well.",4.0,1379980800,"09 24, 2013",Nokia Lumia 520 GoPhone (AT&amp;T),48.04,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oUm2c3OtL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 66},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"

B00E45043A,A1KT8QQ74E3SVQ,DiscoverYellow,"[3, 3]","While the phone is rather crippled: no compass, no flashlight, no NFC, modest 5mpx camera, it's the kind of limitations I can live with at this price point.The device is less than the cost of one month's ATT GoPhone service plan (or prices of some of the fancy iPhone cases). Also fair to point out that this device retails for about $150 in the rest of the world. I think, had it been priced globally for $59 like here, it would be the world's best selling phone of all times.Now having rubbed in the affordability of the proposition, let's look at what it has to offer:- Genuine high quality Nokia smartphone. (And those US-run-Finns know how to make quality products that appeal to the US market.) The device is just beautifully made with nothing to complain about.- Robust to drops even without a protective case. Having used it for a month I realized that I had dropped the phone so many times on hard surfaces (including pavement and bathroom tile) and it is still fine aside from minor scratches around the edges. I know my iPhone bearing friends broke their screen this way. Nokia Lumia 520 just pops the back cover off and keeps safe.- Size it a perfect fit in your hand and it's slim too. Nice to grip in a call or hold while tapping away an email.- A great introduction to Windows Phone 8 (key reason I got it). WP8 is notorious for great integration with Microsoft Outlook service and I really wanted to try it out without getting stuck with the device for two years or committing $699 for a ""contract free"" top tier Lumia.- The device has MicroSD slot so for another $36 I got a 64Gb memory card and effectively got more storage than the largest iPod Touch to put most of my music collection on it.- The battery is removable, and while there is no reason you would want to swap it often as the charge last a full day of use, it is useful to have that functionality to swap the battery (removable BL-5J) and keep going in case you plan to be away from outlets for more than a day. I have a separate charging stand for Nokia batteries (DT-33) that can top off spares.- And last but not least, this holiday season as most places get wintery cold, you can keep your gloves on and still use the touch screen. Tested and it works!Bottom line: for under $100 you get a device functionally comparable to a 64Gb iPod that can also make calls and access high-speed LTE data. And no monthly commitment required.UPDATE: After about one month of usage I'd like to add that the quality of the DSP (digital sound processor) put into it by Nokia is terrific!!! It is clear, more or less powerful to drive common cans (headphones), and has crisp trebles and substantial lows.Surprisingly plugging in my Fiio headphone amplifier does very little to improve on the great base line this phone has.

Since I'm not eligible for an upgrade yet and I wasn't willing to spend the $700+ to replace the iPhone, i opted for an alternative. Since I am already an ATT customer and this being a Locked ATT GoPhone, I just inserted my SIM card in and worked. I did buy a nano SIM to MicroSIM adapter since iPhones use Nano sim and this phone only takes MicroSIM.Since its a budget smartphone, it lacks many of the premium features that the iPhone or other premium phones have such as a fast processor, high quality display, multiple sensors, better quality camera with flash, front facing camera, noise cancelling microphone, LTE etc. etc.What I love is that its light, screen is bright enough and color is decent, resolution is adequate, touch response is good and the processor snappy enough for the average app. May not be fast enough for some graphic intensive game but I don't play games on my phone so no issues there. With this phone, I'm able to do the things I need to do which is, email, facebook, twitter, internet, call messaging and music. Even though its not an LTE phone, 4G is fast enough. This is enough to keep me satisfied until I my contract allows me for an upgrade with subsidized pricing.Battery life is good. GPS. Call quality is decent. The volume on the earpiece is loud enough, speaker phone is adequate and WIndows8 is easy to navigate. 8GB internal memory and expandable via MicroSD card. Good music playback as well.  WIndows8 is pretty good. What I don't like it's that many of the apps I had on iOS, they are not available for Win8 which is why I gave this phone a 4 out of 5.Overall, this smart phone has enough features and I was actually impressed with it. The more I use it, the more i like it but I still do miss my iPhone. For a phone less than $100, I think its great. Biggest draw back is the lack of apps from MicroSoft because of WIndows 8 but the OS if very nice.

B00E45043A,A1YC96FXANNGNU,ElleWishes,"[1, 1]","Very simple to use after I set it up for my father in law.  My wife had given him her Blackberry, but it was too much for him to keep up with.  He didn't need a smart phone, because 'everyone else' has one.  All apps are still on the phone, but they don't show up on the main screen as clutter because my father in law doesn't use that stuff or doesn't know how to use that stuff.  Did not activate as a GoPhone, but cut the AT&T; SIM to fit in this.  He gets a new phone for probably less than a contract phone AND he isn't on contract.  I picked this because the battery can be replaced, I could add a microSD card and Win8 on a phone works pretty well (even though I hate it on the desktop).I could organize and resize the tiles (icons/visual buttons) on the phone to keep it simple.  Screen is slightly better in sunlight than my iPhone 4.  No noticable difference in colour (FYI, I'm not colour blind) compared to my iPhone.  Resolution, at the distance we look at the phone, shows no difference either.  Cover over the battery is a little cheap/flimsy, so I'm glad I picked up a case to protect it.  Put a 32 GB microSD card in it so he has plenty of space for video and photos.Wifi worked fine with no problem.  Turned off the data and trimmed his SIM card so AT&T; doesn't automatically charge (fine) him for having a smart phone.  He can text and make calls, which is all he wanted in the first place.

B00E45043A,A1GBT4UN2RW7XY,"For Real ""HAND""","[0, 0]","This phone has a 4-inch IPS LCD screen and runs Windows Phone 8.1. Windows Phone OS, unlike Android, does not spy on its users.  Many apps have icons called Live Tiles which can show additional information, so you don't have to open the app to see the essential info.  Not all Live Tiles are useful, though, same situation with Windows 8. The developer has to make his or her Live Tile useful. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Bing Weather, Bing News, etc. all have super useful Live Tiles. The 520 has tons of features for this price. Two things that ARE missing are a front-facing camera, so Skype is not too useful here if you want to do video chat, and back camera flash. The 5MP camera works really well outdoors but can be grainy indoors, typical of medium-range phone cameras. After all, this is no Lumia 1020 or even 92x. The LCD screen is very nice, though, and the touch function works as well as on an iPhone which is to say the best!  The large icons -- you have three sizes to choose from -- are super easy to read, a great break from the tiny icons on the iPhone and Android. A recent reports says over 70% of American adults suffer from eye fatigue due to using smartphones and tablets. I can tell you that after I started using Windows Phone my eyes have gotten less dry. The 520 makes clear calls. Like all Nokia phones, though, the vibrate function is a little lame. But I don't use vibrate at all, so it's not an issue for me at all.While the phone is the best smartphone for the price, AT&T; Wireless stinks, period. With smartphones, AT&T; does not allow you to add a pay-per-minute plan. You must choose a monthly plan, starting at 25 dollars per 30 days.  T-Mobile is better in this regard, but AT&T;'s network is 10 times better than T-Mobile's, so it's a trade-off I'm willing to accept.  I use a Lumia 925 as my main AT&T; phone, but leave a 520 in my car as a backup phone and also my son carries a 520 to school. He loves it, too. Windows Phone has Kids Corner which limits the phone's functions, for instance it limits the maximum volume, and it's a great and reliable way, unlike a few Android offerings, for kids to use the phone.",5.0,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",Nokia Lumia 520 GoPhone (AT&amp;T),48.04,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oUm2c3OtL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 66},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"

B00E45043A,A5JLAU2ARJ0BO,"Gadgester ""No Time, No Money""","[1, 1]","The Lumia 520 is an excellent low-cost smartphone. It runs the easy-to-use and rock-solid Windows Phone 8 system, and unlike Android, WP does not track and keep tab on everything you do on your phone and then secretely spy on you.  The 4-inch screen is IPS and it has great viewing angles and fast response time.  Color reproduction is quite good if not 100% accurate yet (you get that on the Lumia 1520's new IPS screen).  The touch screen is very responsive and accurate.AT&T;'s GoPhone plans really suck and are not really good values, especially when compared with T-Mobile (our family also has a Lumia 521 for T-Mobile), but its network is lightyears ahead of T-Mobile's, so the trade-off is acceptable to me as I give this to my son and being able to make and receive calls is more important than anything else for a youngster like him.  Speaking of a phone for kids, Windows Phone's Kids' Corner feature is truly excellent.  It sandboxes apps and games you select for kids, and also disables to capacitive Search button at the bottom.A tip if you use Kids' Corner but want to let your kids browse the web: you can't add Internet Explorer to Kids' Corner, but you can download the free yet excellent UC Browser and add it to Kids' Corner.  Be sure to use Bing as your search engine as it does not invade your privacy as much as Google does, and you can turn off tracking entirely, again unlike with Google's services.  Bing also returns better search results than Google, and is extremely friendly for kids (save for the &#34;Trending today&#34; links on its homepage, but you can semi-hide them).This phone is super-light. The back cover is plastic and can be removed, which means two things: 1) you can replace the battery if you want, and 2) you can get a different-color cover if you want.  Be sure to get a replacement cover and/or a case specifically marked for the 520, as its cousin the 521 is slightly longer.  The 520 feels much lighter than the 521 for some reason, even though spec-wise it's not really that much lighter. Both are light, perfect for kids and any pocket.One more thing: to cut cost both this 520 and T-Mobile's 521 include only 512MB of RAM (plus 8GB of storage supplemented by MicroSD support).  Not all WP apps run on 512MB phones, although the vast majority do.  It's mostly a few games that required 1GB.  All the popular non-game apps and most games do run on 512MB phones.In summary, this is an excellent low-cost phone that actually beats most mid-range Android phones in quality and feature set.  It's also robust, and does not spy on you like Android.

There are no indicator lights on the front and no indicator when charging, which I actually prefer as this is a wifi only device primarily for poke at games and netflix.... both of which it works well for. There are also no front facing cameras nor flash for the back camera.The speaker is good enough to use on its own in a quiet room but it would easily be drowned out with any real activity going on.The main flaws I've found so far are with my experiences using a windows OS phone. It is a better OS style for a phone than it is for a PC... but even with this device I would not be able to stand using the horribleness of Windows 8 to make use of the syncable features. They should have just kept the OS designed for the system it is to be used on. For now the Windows phone OS has some nice apps but it is very limited. At least that means you wont have a dozen knock off versions of every good app out there, unfortunately it means you have access to only a handful of apps worth knocking off in the first place.The curved shape of the phone makes it easier to hold in your hand for extended periods of time, however the buttons that also are mounted on the side and spaced so that they take up the majority of that side makes it so that they will get hit when unwanted. The fact that the power button is right in the middle followed by a dedicated camera button gets kind of irritating when trying to poke at an app. The soft keys are also easily fat palmed into activating which will drop you out of your app and into the Bing search screen or home navigation panel. A case does help with the buttons issue but not the fat palming of the soft keys.Overall this is a great price for a poke at device and works great with wifi with no sim installed.

I happen to have a contract with AT&T; and I simply put my sim card in this phone and I was up and running.  It doesn't do LTE speeds, but the faux 4G is good enough.Windows Phone gets a bad rap for lack of apps, and in some cases it is true.  There is no Google support, so if you use Google Voice, you have to do it in the browser.  Gmail can be checked with the built-in email client.  Other than the lack of Google support, most of the big name apps I use are there.  I'm missing Nest, but I can also do that in the browser.If you want to, you can pin webpages, such as Google Voice or Nest to the Start screen and they essentially act as apps (albeit in the browser).This phone is fast enough.  It isn't lacking in speed, as Windows Phone is seemingly optimized for Microsoft's minimum requirements.  You'll see it repeated in tech blogs and videos, and it is true.  Windows Phone feels the same no matter if you are on a 1Ghz dual-core processor (like this phone) or the more expensive models, which are 1.5 Ghz dual-core.  The new 1520 is a quad-core 2.2Ghz.  It will be interesting to see if a quad-core 2.2 Ghz processor makes a difference.Overall, I am pleasantly surprised by the entire package here.  It has enough speed, a very nice screen, and (mostly) all of the apps I use for an incredible price.  It also feels very comfortable in-hand.

It took a while to adjust to the Windows OS but once I got the hang of it, I really like it. It's very easy to customize.  I find the quality of the phone to be exceptional for its price point.

All in all, a great starter or replacement smartphone and it is refreshing to see that AT&T is finally offering a good quality smartphone at an affordable price.",4.0,1379030400,"09 13, 2013",Nokia Lumia 520 GoPhone (AT&amp;T),48.04,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oUm2c3OtL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 66},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"
B00E45043A,A8DUKFVG79KC2,Lauren Glenn,"[7, 8]","I needed a replacement phone and I was pleasantly surprised to see this online.  For $99, you get the basic experience of a Windows Phone minus the high CPU capability for games.  This is fine if you have another gaming device or tablet, so for me, this was a no brainer.Windows Phone does what you need simply and without much hassle.  Bluetooth works great and with Win8Phone, it plays the audio from your videos over bluetooth with no noticeable lag for me.  Connection to Microsoft Exchange accounts is seemless (I've connected to my work Exchange server and my Office365 Exchange server with no problems).  Calendar sync, email sync, and contacts sync works well also.This is not a super fast phone but I don't necessarily need that.  I had a Nokia 820 and this is along those lines but just a little slower.  I got used to it fairly quickly.One good thing about this phone is the micro SD card slot which takes a 64GB Micro SD card without blinking.  No issues there.  Built-in GPS navigation is provided with the HERE apps.  Xbox music works fairly well also and if you need to sync the music with your PC, you can just copy the files onto your SD card by taking it out and putting it in your computer or just use ANY audio sync software (except for Zune) to do that.  I use MediaMonkey which works out of the box since this uses regular MTP.Sound quality is fairly good and unlike other devices, this plays the absolutely superb WMA Pro 24-bit format (48kHz/44.1kHz only though with 2 channels, but still that's something) just like every other Microsoft music player (Zune).  It can announce caller ID, incoming SMS, it has voice control also which is great for hands free SMS reading and replying to people.  I used it once while driving with a bluetooth headset and didn't need to find the phone or push any buttons.  My bluetooth headset was in my ear and I could hear the SMS text and reply back.  It's not a published feature, but there is a setting on the phone to turn that on under Speech and Ease of Access in Settings.Still, compared to low priced Android phones, this one just works great.  Sound quality is very decent for the price and for $99, Microsoft may have just found their niche market.Also, I used this not as a GoPhone with the prepaid SIM but I just took my old micro SIM from my Android phone and put it in.  No extra setup required.  :)  All GoPhones can do that on AT&T;, so I wasn't surprised to find that out.",4.0,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",Nokia Lumia 520 GoPhone (AT&amp;T),48.04,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oUm2c3OtL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 66},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"

B00E45043A,A2J6407B4TJFOW,"Mike Frerkes ""Mike""","[4, 15]","I have extensive experience with entry-level pre-paid smartphones, and the Nokia Lumia 520 is probably the biggest disappointment I've run across.  My reason for purchasing this particular phone was two-fold: 1) I wanted to test out AT&T;'s  network in my area, and 2) I've been curious about the Windows Phone platform.  At just $69, I figured the Lumia would be a cheap way to satisfy both of my curiosities.While I'm trying hard in this review to compartmentalize my criticisms of the Windows Phone platform away from the Lumia itself, there is some degree of entanglement which is hard to isolate.  Even a simple task like playing my library of MP3s (on a 32GB microSD card) seemed to bring this device to its knees.  Whether this is a Lumia hardware problem or a Microsoft software issue, I cannot be certain.  All I know is that playing a large MP3 library on the 520 is more of a hassle than it should be.  The phone would lock up every time I tried to initiate playback.The camera and battery life are passable for a low-end device.  Neither one is particularly impressive.  The processor seems under-powered, as was evidenced by the device's sluggish performance on Temple Run.  There was definite hiccuping throughout the game and touch response, which is very important in this game, seemed to lag at times.  I definitely would not recommend this phone for mobile gaming, unless you're opting for simple titles that require little graphics processing.Windows Phone, like any platform, has its strengths and weaknesses.  In the case of WP, the lack of app selection really cripples a phone that already has obvious hardware limitations.  There are basic apps (Pandora, Facebook, etc.) that work just fine on the Lumia.  However, for those who seek a richer smartphone experience, I think Windows Phone is still way behind iOS and Android.  It's all a matter of personal preference, but anyone leaving those two platforms for WP should be prepared for a much smaller library.  People coming from a non-smartphone background probably won't notice the difference as much.In summation, the Lumia 520 is an &#34;okay&#34; value for those with low expectations.  For those seeking a more vibrant pre-paid smartphone experience, there are better offerings out there which are comparably priced.",2.0,1385424000,"11 26, 2013",Nokia Lumia 520 GoPhone (AT&amp;T),48.04,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oUm2c3OtL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 66},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"

B00E45043A,A3KKA2GYA0J7LB,Morphling,"[107, 122]","I have owned flagship phones, prepaid pieces of junk, international phones, flip phones, etc.  This Lumia 520 is by far and away the best deal on a phone I've ever seen.  That's not to say it's the best phone ever, clearly you can spend hundreds more to make that happen.  What this phone did was show that an inexpensive phone needn't be cheap too.  As others have said, if you're on the fence, just purchase this already.  It's a no brainer.  I will note, I did get mine significantly cheaper than the price listed here - the brick and mortar store that makes the OS on this phone was running a demo that knocked off many dollars on any item.  Anyway, onto more of the review.Overall build/design of the phone - The phone is a very basic look which I find better.  It's functional and nothing more, but it isn' also abrasive looking or ugly.  The back is made of that soft touch plastic and I love that stuff.  It provides grip, it doesn't feel 'cheap', and it doesn't scratch/dent easily.  All the physical buttons are on the right side of the phone - which is nice too.  You can grip your phone in your left hand without pushing some volume button or what not.  The buttons are OK to push - the power works best and so does the camera button(which has two stages so you can focus and snap a pic quickly).  The volume rocker is harder to push and push quickly, but you can just hold it to turn volume up/down.  Also note, if you take the back off to pull the battery or SD card or what not, make sure you put the cover back on very well - mine was off by a tad and the camera button didn't engage.  Overall, the phone is built solidly, it's good looking, and everything is laid out well.Screen - This is always hard as you have to physically look at the screen to decide if you like it or not.  I find the panel to be good given the price, size, etc.  The resolution is just fine for a 4'' screen.  Yes, a full 1080p screen is good, but even as a tech guy I thought it was overkill for a phone.  The screen gets bright enough if you set it to high.  You can only set it to low, medium, and high.  Also you can leave it on auto, which I do.  It works well enough and I can always read the screen.  Colors are bright and accurate as far as I can tell.  You can adjust more specific color things in the settings too.  The IPS makes it so you can view it well without having it dead on.  I will say it's  a very glossy screen so reflections do get noticed.  There is some of that dark 'banding' I'll call it at the bottom of the screen.  Many phones, laptops, etc. I have, have had this, so I get over it.The touch screen works very well and while I'm not wearing gloves in the Arizona summer, I did put a cloth over my hand and try it - it worked just as well.  No bad touches or anything amiss with the touch screen.Call quality/data/signal - I'll put these all into the same category as I don't wish to review any specific network.  The calls on this phone work well, they sound OK.  It's a bit fuzzy, as if you're talking on a cell phone (go figure, but I've had much clearer calls on cell phones recently).  Nobody has complained that they can't hear me well.  Data on this sucker is HSPA 21, which is fast enough for me.  I get the typical 2-5mbps down in my area and about 1.5mpbs up.  Things load quickly on the phone, it syncs stuff well, and it doesn't stop my day.  My signal strength is about par for my other Samsung, LG, etc. phones, so it's nothing to write home about, but it's acceptable.  My old motorola phone still holds a great signal where my other phones struggle, so it could be better.Software/OS - I won't be reviewing the Windows phone 8 in depth.  It's a very nice OS, slick, good looking, gets stuff done without getting in your way.  Yes, it has limits.  Sure, the available applications are behind iOS and Android, which is a valid concern.  The store is also confusing compared to the others, so finding stuff isn't as easy, which is odd given most apps are very easy to use.  The included Nokia software is awesome I'll say.  Their version of maps and navigation are very good - hasn't failed me yet and just as good as google maps/nav.  The Nokia music is great - it beats pandora and google music hands down - simply because it's free.  Also, it does work very well.  The included software for the camera is nice - nothing mind-blowing but it's useful and I like it.  I'll talk about the physical camera more.  Mail, messages, phone, etc. are all very easy to use and look nice.  Overall, Microsoft did well with the OS here and partnering with Nokia provided a bit of extra 'oomph' to the mix.  Go to a phone store and tell the sales people to leave you alone and try out a windows phone for a while to see how it works.  That's the only way you'll know regardless of how many reviews you read.Camera - It's a basic camera.  Nokia does well with optics so even though this is 'only' 5mp, it takes decent looking and clear pictures.  It doesn't have a flash, which I don't mind anyway - any cell phone with a flash makes pictures look washed out or if you don't use a flash, it's just dark and grainy.  It takes pictures quickly and as I said about some of the nice software, you can flash 5 pictures quickly to pick your favorite. I don't get why people slam cameras on phones - they work well enough and aren't the main attraction - some phones come with respectable cameras now but you'll pay for it.  If you need that, get one.  Otherwise, buy a good stand-alone camera you can use lenses and such on and enjoy excellent pictures.Overall - I'm impressed with this phone and even more so given the rock-bottom price.  It has some signs of a 'cheap' phone such as you must manually pull your SD card out - no spring loaded ejection (this phone can take an SD card, unlike MANY new Android devices and all iPhones.  The ability to add a lot more storage, cheaply and quickly, is good regardless.)  The screen is a bit glossy, but oh well.  It's a full, honest smartphone that has good specs and works scarily well for the price of an impulse buy.  Purchase this phone and save yourself money upfront with a cheap phone.  Purchase a prepaid plan and save yourself money every month.  Don't ever worry about a 2 year contract again!",5.0,1376524800,"08 15, 2013",Nokia Lumia 520 GoPhone (AT&amp;T),48.04,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oUm2c3OtL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 66},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"
B00E45043A,A1YUWK0O71JG0W,Muttley,"[1, 1]","I bought this phone after my wife accidentally washed my previous 4.5 years old phone in my pocket. That was not a smartphone and had no fancy features so upgrading to this entry level smartphone was a giant leap for me. Although I have not myself owned a smartphone before, I am familiar with the mobile devices due to my sister's samsung galaxy s4 and my two android tablets (two kindle fire HD's and nexus 7) After a week of use my initial experience is as follows:Pros:1-Unbeatable price. I paid $54 for a smartphone with the screen size as big as an Iphone which is great... I have already been an AT&T; go phone user and thus being locked in AT&T; did not make a difference for me. If you are a current go-phone customer all you need to do is to go to an AT&T; branch and replace your old full size sim card with a micro sim card. The good news is that the card is free. The bad news is that upon getting that card your old one becomes cancelled so you don't have a reserve card and you lose the numbers stored in that card. But it was no big deal for me.2-Screen quality: This is the most receptive screen I have so far seen. It is very easy to type and scroll due to high sensitivity of the screen. The screen has 235 ppi pixel density which may look low compared to high end smartphones like samsung galaxy S4 (441ppi) and iphone 4 (336ppi) but relatively similar to my tablets kindle fire hd 8.9 inch (254ppi) and 7 inch (216ppi) So even watching movies, I saw nothing troubling to the eye.3- Windows 8 operating system: This is both a plus and a minus. It is a plus since it is pretty fast and performs great in most applications as well as browsing the net and watching videos. Especially watching videos might be a big trouble for android devices since flash is  supported in neither silk browser (the worst browsing experience ever thanks to amazon) nor chrome (fast and reliable but does not support flash and my only option was to use third party browser like dolphin in those devices. Luckily this phone performs great with those troublesome videos using internet explorer. I had no compability issues and no freezing or crashing websites yet.4-Built in apps: There are some apps coming from AT&T; and some from nokia in addition to the built in windows apps. I found some pretty useful. Maps and the GPS function performs well and yet I have not missed google maps.5-Processor and memory functions: Considering this as a $54 phone, it has pretty good features in this field. I know 512mb ram sucks , especially if you are after gaming or challenging apps. But As long as you don't force the memory with demanding apps and lot's of files that would work fine. On the other hand 1ghz Qualcomm dual core processor is unexpectedly good for a device that cheap. The greatest hit in this category is that it has an expandable memory option. The starting 8gb is pretty low but it can handle up to 64gb micro SD card which puts this device over the brand new amazon firephone and nexus 5 where you are stuck with what you buy. That means a lot of videos, photos and other stuff...6-Photo and video quality: This is again both a plus and a minus. I recorded a couple of videos with quite good results and the photos are good if taken under good lighting conditions. 5MP is not bad at all.7- Several other fancy apps I have discovered so far (will update if I find out something new in the future) The ones I liked best are the voice command SMS function, the automatic battery protector function as well as auto activated drive mode.Cons:1- Windows operating system: The apps are pretty limited and I miss the apps I used a lot in my android devices. It may get better in time but not there yet. Besides the start screen does not get to horizontal view so you have to go through it vertically as if the phone was orientation locked.2-Photo has no flash which makes it pretty inadequate under dim light. Camera does not have zoom and has no image stabilizer. It also gets confused when trying to focus in fast movements causing blurred unfocused frames for split seconds.3- The charger does not have a detachable USB cord and it is not very long. That is not a big deal for me since I have plenty of different chargers around but it would be nice to have a detachable original charger.4-No front camera: No way you can enjoy video calls..5-SAR value. This is something most people ignore but that shows howmuch radiation a phone emits and this was my biggest consideration before purchasing my previous phone. This phone ranks moderate for emission 0.77W/kg which is half the maximum allowed limit but more than double of samsung galaxy s4 (0.33W/kg) Those who makes a lot of calls should consider more brain friendly versions. I do not normally use the phone a lot so I could oversee that fact for this model...The cons list can be added a lot of other stuff but I am trying to be fair in my review by considering the price for value factor. Therefore I rate this phone pretty high and way above my expectations. With some cheap accessories like a screen protector and a case, I am sure I will be able to enjoy it for my modest needs for quite a long time.",5.0,1405468800,"07 16, 2014",Nokia Lumia 520 GoPhone (AT&amp;T),48.04,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oUm2c3OtL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 66},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"
B00E45043A,A2BX8DDQGCCG2J,MWebb,"[7, 7]","If you made the mistake of purchasing this phone thinking to use it overseas, or on TMobile over here, and just discovered it is &#34;locked&#34; to AT&T; (even though you own it and thought &#34;no contract&#34; meant &#34;unlocked&#34;), there are still a lot of useful things to do with, apart from fuming:1. Out of the box, insert battery, power it up, and go to Settings.2. Set &#34;Airplane Mode&#34;.3. Power off, remove battery, insert the provided GoPhone SIM.- The SIM is essential for downloading Nokia Here Maps, which are GREAT.4. Go to Settings, turn on WiFi mode. Don't turn off Airplane Mode! Leave it the way you set it in step 2.- Airplane Mode keeps the phone from searching for a cellular carrier and forcing you to activate the phone.5. There are some advantages to having a Microsoft Outlook free email account. Go to outlook &#60;dot&#62; com and get a free account if you don't already have one.6. Go to Settings and add some Accounts:- Microsoft (your new or existing Outlook account).- Nokia (for free and purchased apps from the Store).- Google, FaceBook, Yahoo! Mail, Twitter, LinkedIn, IBM Notes Traveler, and generic POP and IMAP accounts are your other choices.7. While in Settings use the &#34;left arrow&#34; a permanent below-the-screen left arrow to move back to the main Settings menu and set Brightness to High with no automatic control. This works best except in dim settings like on an airplane with lights out, where I use Low for Kindle reading.8. On the same first page of Settings, scroll down to Phone Update and check for system updates. You should already have the &#34;Black&#34; update set, 8.1 will come out in a couple of months. Check about once a week.9. Apps will update too, a number will appear on the Live Tile for Store. Sometimes important updates like FaceBook are announced but the Store won't auto update right away - you can force an update by searching for that app, then clicking on it, and clicking manually on the update bar that appears.10. Download these apps (my favorites, YMMV):- WhatsApp, Line, Viber. Or your favorite message/free phone call solution.- Most of these require an active phone number to work. If you use your other phone's number, that will erase your account on that other phone, when you use the text supplied PIN to activate on the Lumia 520. That might change someday, but for now linkage to phone numbers is a limitation.- Skype. Works REALLY well on the Lumia 520.- Kindle. Works so-so. I read a couple of books inflight so it isn't screen sharpness that is the problem. The problem is a little Amazon software funkiness that occasionally cuts off a line or two of text between pages. To fix, rotate from book orientation to landscape to read your text then rotate back. The rotation seems to fix the problem.- Facebook. Fine for consumption, not so fine for editing your posts or comments. Much improved over last year.- Facebook MESSENGER. Yes, it is a separate app, and more and more people use it, is a good substitutes for WhatsApp, Line, Viber, and Facebook doesn't care how many devices you have it on. A mature product on Lumia 520. Be sure to pay attention to the little delta wing that rats out your location - default is on, so you WILL be tracked by friends and frenemies. Well tracked when you answer a message.11. From the home screen - press the Home soft button on the bottom of the screen - flick the screen to the left to see the list of apps, all the apps, and open HERE Maps.- Choose your state and download your map.- Going to Dublin? etc? download that map. The maps don't take up a lot of space.- Yes, GPS works without cellular service, so long as you downloaded the map. Remember, the maps won't download if you didn't put your SIM card in (you can remove it later, but why bother?).12. Some good exercise apps that work well with the LOUD speaker on this tiny phone:- 7 Minute Scientific.- Tabatas.13. For music:- Because it has the necessary licenses from MicroSoft, 64gb and even 128gb micro SD's fit and work fine. I use a 64gb to hold almost all my music.- It will play current iTunes tracks fine (everything except the early DRM digital rights management copy protected tunes), mp3. it will not play Ogg Vorbis.- The player is called Music & Videos and comes stock; until updates, it might appear as Nokia Music or as xBox, Nokia Mix Radio is a separate app which provides free streaming music from Nokia. Very cool!REMEMBER, all this is WITHOUT cellular phone service!You have a camera, music player, GPS unit, e-reader, and minimalist web browser, all in a $60 or so package! And the option of using it to back up your AT&T; and AT&T; driven phone service, if you need it.SHORTCOMINGS:1. Due to the 512mb memory limitation, app switching is painfully slow. NOT unusably slow, but by modern standards PITA slow.2. A few games and rare apps won't run in a 512mb footprint. Before you go ballistic on this memory limitation, keep in mind the iPad 2 and original Mini are both 512mb. Like Apple, though, MicroSoft uses compiled code for its apps - more efficient - than Android, which &#34;compiles code&#34; on the fly via an interpreter - hence Android needs faster processors and more RAM (but in current editions and with modern hardware, Android is plenty fast).3. This is DVD resolution, not HD. It is 800x480, not one of the higher resolutions. The type looks crisp, not pixelated, but you don't get as much information per screen on websites or Kindle, and the screen - for resolution AND quality reasons - isn't good for serious video watching.4. No front camera. This is a BIGGIE for many selfie fans. On the rear, no FLASH but the camera DOES autofocus. I don't like flash, I prefer natural light even if the picture goes grainy etc. so I'm ok with this.UNEXPECTED SURPRISE:1. The battery life is absolutely incredible, with cellular radio turned off via the Airplane Mode switch.2. Nokia continues to roll out major software updates for this amazing little helper - even Win Phone 8.1 is coming to the 520, which means being able to run apps from the uSD card and, finally, being able to set ringer and music volumes separately (saves ears, that).So I've found plenty of uses for my Lumia 520, even if it isn't good for travel or TMob. I wish it were unlocked, and would have paid more for an unlocked one from Nokia (if they sold unlocked phones direct, like Google and Motorola and Apple do), but my buyer's mistake hasn't turned into buyer's remorse.You will be blown away by the design, looks, and quality of this little bargain.",5.0,1396828800,"04 7, 2014",Nokia Lumia 520 GoPhone (AT&amp;T),48.04,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oUm2c3OtL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 66},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"

Coming from the iOS background, I was not expecting much from what is essentially an entry level Windows Phone.  However, after having it for a week, I must admit that I am really really impressed by what Nokia and Microsoft have delivered.  Even though the screen isn't HD, it is actually quite good, the colors are vivid with good contrast.  You do notice a bit of jagging but definitely livable.  What is most impressive is how fluid and quick the touch screen and the system respond.  Something that can't be said for the lower priced Android phones which tend to be quite laggy and not fluid at all.  Although Windows Phone doesn't have a lot of quality apps just yet, the few essential ones like Facebook and Skype are there and work really well.  Even without a working ATT mobile line, calls made using Skype were clear and loud.

Last year, just for change, I sold iphone 5 and bought used lumia 900 cyan. It was a great change after owning iphone for years. I still remember the clear black display and glossy curved screen. Within 2 months I bought lumia 920 off eBay before release. I used it for 4 months and was very happy with everything except the weight. I usually keep my phone in upper shirt pocket ,so I always felt lumia 920s weight. This year I sold Lumia 920 and bought HTC One. Great Phone, great resolution, stable OS, great speaker etc.Recently in Amazon Deals I found lumia 520 for 79 dollars without contract. Amazon has made one click too easy. So without thinking I just clicked.I got the phone within one day.My notes on this phone:Stable OS. I love windows 8. Clean OS and a good change from ios and android. Once it gets good apps then I think It will be on top soon.Great looks and availability of swappable multi color back covers.Awesome battery life. It reminds me olden days. I always used the battery saver mode. I charged this phone 3 days ago and it has some 35% left. I have to admit I didn't use it more than an hour for past 3 days. But doing the same with my HTC One, the battery will be dead in just 1 day. May be non availability of LTE runs it longer.Screen is good but not great. Though the resolution is almost same as lumia 900 ,I feel lumia 900 screen is much better than this one.The PPI on this phone is more then lumia 900 but lumia 900 screen looked sharp.I never found pixels in lumia 900. In this phone certain colors clearly shows pixels. The color of screen does makes difference. Green colors show pixels more then blue.If you planning to cut SIM and use it then be careful. I think the thickness of regular SIM  gives very tight fit on this phone. Though micro Sims slips very easily.Camera is not great. It's an average camera for basic photography.Price is unbeatable. Spend 3 dollars and its unlocked.I didnt feel there is any signal problem on this phone. You can hold any ways unlike iphone.Speaker is average. Sound is just enough.Voice is clear over conversation.Overall i recommend this phone for the low price.Can be a great secondary phone.",4.0,1377216000,"08 23, 2013",Nokia Lumia 520 GoPhone (AT&amp;T),48.04,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oUm2c3OtL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 66},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"

The OS however with Windows 8.1 developer gives all the same cool features including Cortana (which the kids LOVE) that I have on my 1520. Switching between apps is smooth but does have some lag time again this is 512k ram on a dual core chip. Movie play back is good no issue with the Win app store and emulators load on it well to play video games. Again no skype face chat because of the lack of front cam. Other wise this is a truly wonderful phone.  There are a ton of screen protectors and cases out there for them. One lacking feature that they wish they had was Qi or PMA wireless (pinless) charging. If you need a front cam or wireless charging this is not for you. Also the wifi range is pretty good in the house almost as good as my Nexus7 (1st gen) tablet.The Windows 8 OS (stock) is cool, but lacking some key features, that's why we upgraded to 8.1 developer on all phones ( and that fact that I am developing a Win App :-) ). But the live tiles do allow good battery life of over 8 hours with mid usage. The color full titles do get distracting again part of the removal on 8.1 allow transparency. So if you have an extra 50 and need a phone for either a back up or a new phone buy this one, and wait for the over the air update for 8.1 you won't be sorry.  Ps Netflixs plays very well and does not green screen or have the same issues as Andorid and Apple have.",5.0,1404950400,"07 10, 2014",Nokia Lumia 520 GoPhone (AT&amp;T),48.04,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oUm2c3OtL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 66},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Accessories'], ['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'No-Contract Cell Phones', 'Phones']]"

So I tested the camera and little by little, those yellow-tinted problems have gone away so ""CHEERS"" Nokia and Microsoft, I apologies if I gave it a 1/5 star on my rating because its frustrating at first but I changed it recently thanks to that recently released black update. Now and forever I'm a Nokia fan and a Microsoft product user, I'm still testing the phone so I only gave it a 4/5 stars for now and might comeback again in a few days to test out the black update on the Lumia 1020.

B00E5M3JVG,AQ6YCJKPHZUF6,S. Burgess,"[6, 11]","This is an exceptional phone, easy to use, very intuitive and GREAT camera. However there are some drawbacks that I came to not like after 3 months of use, end recently sold the phone to get the iPhone 5s.Camera:The camera and the video recorder render great results, but it takes longer to get the camera open (even when using the side button) and to finally take a shot versus the iPhone. As a result I missed out on catching some moments while visiting my friends baby because the camera didn't open fast enough. I'm not saying this is a drawback to not buy, but if you are not a photographer but more of a 'heat of the moment' camera phone / Reddit user who posts funny shots, then you might miss out because of the lag.Also, someone mentioned the up-close shots not working. It's true. You can switch to macro and spend time adjusting settings, but problem is you can't get truly up close to an object. I was trying to shoot jewelry pics to share a photo of my engagement ring and I had to take shots from about 5 inches away and then crop them. Obviously this is just a small drawback because I should truly be using a DSLR if I need high quality macro shots. But I was disappointed. I actually went to a Microsoft store to get help using the camera and I still couldn't get up close shots to work correctly.Operating System:I bought this phone for the camera, but after 3 months I barely used it enough to warrant the change to Windows. I think the problem is I was spoiled with some great apps on the iPhone (native instagram app, Flipboard, educational apps). Instagram and Flipboard are finally releasing a Windows version but it won't be out until January 2014 (most likely). I used those apps daily and the substitute apps for instagram are just not as fluid and easy as the original.After a month, I was barely using the phone compared to my old iPhone 4s. It would just sit in my bag and I'd take an occasional photo and just text message. I now realize just how much I wasn't utilizing it after switching back to iPhone.Music:Compared to the iPhone, the music setup on the Lumia 1020 is terrible. It's not intuitive, and if for instance you are listening to a song on your headphones or AUX cable in your vehicle, you need to turn up the volume considerably, but when you detach the cable the phone doesn't realize that you did this. It stays on full volume. Imagine getting a phonecall on 30/30 volume. The iPhone recognizes the changes automatically, so this was a drawback after a while since I use a AUX cable setup in my car.Gps/Directions:Best maps software period. Directions don't require data if you download them on home first via wi-fi. I would recommend this phone for heavy gps users / travelers.Various:It took me 2 months to figure out how to use 'linked inboxes' so if you're struggling to use outlook, do yourself a favor and go online and watch a 2 minute video. The mail functions in this phone are unparalleled. Also, being able to edit microsoft word documents is great. It was another reason I bought the phone and I barely used to be honest, but it is GREAT when you need it.My brother has had windows phones since they first came out, swears by them, and loves them. He connects via his Xbox account and likes to keep everything within the same ecosystem from phone, computer, tablet, gaming. This is a wonderful aspect to Microsoft, much like the Apple ecosystem offers the iPad, Macbook, iPod, iPhone. I personally have all the those apple devices so it was hard to transition to using a Windows phone, where I can't transfer things as easily. There is a Windows Phone program you can download to your Mac Computer to easily transfer files, you can download via the Microsoft support site.Glitches:When resetting the phone to factory settings, it took 16 hours of spinning gears, multiple hard resets, until it let me setup the phone for the person I was selling to. 16 hours. I was disgusted. After reading the same problem online for other users, I realize that some phones take 30 minutes and one guy said it took him 24 hours to factory reset the phone. I thought I had bricked the device about 3 hours in, but low and behold it came back to life the morning after I started. This is unacceptable. Microsoft released a patch for this but you need to experience to fix it and I didn't take the time to. Frankly, I shouldn't have to for a 800$ phone.Overall:If you want a powerful camera on a phone, like windows 8, and don't mind less apps, this is the phone for you. If you are however in love with iOS and don't mind iOS7, then stick with iPhone and get the 5s. The camera isn't as great as the Lumia 1020, but for the casual user you won't notice the difference.",4.0,1383955200,"11 9, 2013",Nokia Lumia 1020 GSM Unlocked Phone,400.8,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51o2tQMtjeL._SX300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 29625},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

B00H2BJ7WC,AO4DCU243V8AU,Ben,"[2, 2]","I live in the Prepaid world. The last five phones I've bought have been Unlocked, for use with prepaid carriers. Basically, I decided to never sign a two-year agreement again, and I've been loving my live in the unlocked-realm ever since.Just seven months ago, I bought the Lumia 820 and found it (and the Windows Phone experience) to be 100% fun and fantastic - the best phone I've ever owned. I had seen many advertisements, videos and reviews on the flagship Lumia 1520, which I would loved to have had - but there is no way I'd fork out $500 on a phone.THEN, I learned of the Lumia 1320, which I call a &#34;poor man's Lumia 1520&#34; ... a Lumia 1520 for the rest of us. A fantastic, 6-inch Tablet / Phone that is fast, responsive, beautiful and of Quality build. It performs beautifully and looks every bit as good. It feels good in the hand.All of this for less than $300 unlocked, just a little more than I paid for my Lumia 820 (which I have also reviewed here). You'll hear some criticism from tech &#34;critics&#34; out on the web, complaints about the pixel density, camera, etc. Don't worry about it and don't take any of those &#34;reviewers&#34; too seriously. The relative PPI is more than adequately made up and compensated for in the fundamentals of the quality and the Clear Black IPS LCD Display. In short, things look great, photos look great, videos look great.Internal Storage is 8GB, leaving about 4-5 Gigs for your use. There is a slot for Micro SD card and the Windows OS settings allows you to designate all storage, downloads, saved photos, videos and music to the card ... AND Apps; I've loaded mine up with a 32 Gig card, which should keep me fat and comfy for awhile.Interchangeable Back Plates - you can buy and swap out back plates of various colors for your Lumia 1320, giving yourself a whole &#34;new&#34; phone to suit your mood. Once slapped on, it looks like a solid piece of polycarbonate that is permanently affixed. I bought this as a white phone, have bought back battery covers in Yellow, Black, Orange and Green. This is one of the features of the Lumia 820 that I really enjoyed, nice to have it here as well. As a side note, the back cover is much easier to remove on the 1320.Battery Life is VERY good. I don't know how they do it, but Nokia has managed to created a Tablet Phone with robust life and lower battery drain. I'm comparing this to my Lumia 820 (which was good) and my Blu Vivo 4.8 HD (android) phone. I'm getting plenty of talk time and long periods of standby time on this, a benefit I was not expecting.Camera. In order to put all this together at what is essentially a third-world price, you have to cut some corners somewhere. That is where we find the biggest difference between the 1320 and it's flagship big brother, the 1520. You've got a 5MP camera, which for me, is also a step-down from my Lumia 820. Guess what? I don't care. At 5MP, you still have sharp optics, a quarter-inch sensor and Fast Glass - a 2.4 aperture lens, which gathers much light, fast enough to garner nice results in dimly-lit places. An LED flash rounds it out, and if you really need to rag on the fact this phone's camera has less than 10, 20 or 40MP ... go buy a cheap point-and-shoot camera and carry that in your other pocket.Gorilla Glass 3 - Huge bonus and nice surprise to have a budget Tablet Phone with such sturdy, state-of-the-art elements. This is not something I expected to find at a piece of kit for under $300 dollars, and especially not at this size!Main Video Camera shoots at 1080p, Full HD (1920 X 1080) at 30 frames per second. Again, something you would not expect at this price. I have shot and viewed videos on my (60-inch) TV, and loving the results.I've upgraded this to Windows 8.1, as I did with my Lumia 820. Both phones have taken the upgrade flawlessly. If you want more technical details, check out some of the many sites on the web, and I encourage you to view some of the youtube videos as well. You'll get more detailed tech talk and a good idea as to what it looks (and feels like) in the hand. Just remember to take those &#34;critics&#34; with a grain of salt. For my part ... as a real-life owner and verified buyer of the Lumia 1320, I'm telling you this Tablet Phone is fan-TASTIC.If you've ever dreamed of owning the Lumia 1520 but can't afford it (or have more sense than to spend $500 for a phone device) ... or if you'd just like a Tablet Phone that is good, solid and FUN to operate ... or if you're in any way on the fence about this, jump off that fence and buy one of these now!

I love the 1520 design, everything is placed where it should. Buttons are placed nicely!! The camera button comes very handy!The back camera? Amazing, wonderful! As a photo enthusiast I can say the camera is one of the best phone cameras I have seen with many advanced features! And the camera button comes really handy! The flash sucks. It should have been xenon.Front camera? Still needs some work, for my taste it sucks pretty badly. Grainy and slow if dark! Bad, bad, bad resolution.Sensors are precise and work perfectly, I always turned them off in my S3, S4, Note, HTC's, Moto's because they were random and not precise... they made me rage more than once. Only thing missing is an IR blaster, that would be really useful! And maybe fingerprint scanner ONLY if it works as it should, I think that technology is not ready yet for prime time.Also about Qi charging, once you go for it there's no way back! I even put a DT 900 hidden on my desk and nightstand, charges fast and it is so convenient!Processor? Powerful. You can throw anything at it! If you updated to WP 8.1 DP... It is a DEVELOPER PREVIEW so it will lag a little sometimes and some things won't work as intended, you will have to make a soft reset-restart and hopefully it will resolve your issue or you will have to wait for the official release.The battery in this thing is amazing, I'd never have thought that it would last forever with the screen size but it does! Using Xbox music to stream music all day! Whatsapp, FB and web browsing all day, by 10 PM is still around 15-20%. ~5 hours of listening to music with a Sony Bluetooth SBH20, 4-5 hours of screen time while using Whatsapp, FB, web browsing, skipping songs. Gaming, once in a while.It has micro SD slot, YES! No micro SD slot is a deal killer for me!SIM tray is loose! BAD!Touch screen sensitivity is good, perfect! And I have no more issues with it!Signal is good but it will chose slowest networks (EDGE, 3G, HSDPA+) if they are stronger than the fastest ones. And you CAN'T force it to HSDPA or LTE.Screen is gorgeous, crisp, clear, stunning! But there's a defect with most lumias, in white backgrounds you will see brighter spots in a specific part of the screen exactly where the back camera is placed. Other than that is perfect for me! Anyway you won't notice the bright spot!Glance feature is wonderful! I think it is not supported by 930 and some others phones because of the screen technology used.VERY IMPORTANT. Screen seems to be fragile, still haven't drop it! Case or insurance could save your life, screen replacement is expen$ive. I have seen many post talking about broken digitizers and screens. Replacing only the digitizer is NOT easy at all if you manage to replace it without breaking the screen, that if you are lucky enough and didn't break the screen.SOFTWAREI've had about everything but iPhone, I do love my 1520 but as a power user WP 8.1 is still lacking advanced features/options. About the apps, I have the ones I need but they are lacking advanced options/features because of WP limitations and some others because apparently programmers aren't putting much effort in WP apps. But with WP 8.1 they finally added so much stuff that was missing and with WP 8.1 Microsoft is finally giving more freedom for making apps with everything we need but still not as much as Android.For most people 8.1 will do! I am a power user, but most people are not! They have everything they need in 8.1 (just a few things missing, maybe some advanced options would be nice) BUT the 1520 is BLAZING FAST! Butter smooth! Not like my any other phone I've had!Size of everything is about perfect on a 1520! The keyboard and the new swipe thing is amazing! Cortana is nice, and we have music recognition integrated (I'd suggest MS to improve it, is slow sometimes and if you don't have internet connection you are done. Some apps in Android store the recording so you can search that song later, you can't do that with Bing)! Also integrated translation and QR scan, pretty sweet to translate things just with the camera.Now WP and Lumia has some unique features and apps that I love so much and are freaking good: IE sucks on Windows but on WP is way too good, beats any other browser! Nokia apps are awesome, beamer, maps, camera, etc.!The integration with Microsoft services is good, you will love it! It integrates with many services very nicely!For music lovers, Xbox music pass is the way to go! Better than Pandora, Spotify, etc.! Music player is kind of mediocre but it will do. Gallery is GOOD! Better than android!Clean and simple OS, very good looking! I'd only add a few more advanced options and more transparent tiles for this new image backgrounds! And a color palette to choose our own accent and background colors, that would be sweet!OVERALLHardware is good and this thing is damn pretty! Problems? Loose SIM tray, bright spots on the screen (you won't notice unless someone told you so), front camera sucks, FRAGILE screen. No IR blaster, no fingerprint yet. Battery, screen, processor, sensors, etc are amazing! Micro SD slot up to 128GB!Software? You get everything you need, still missing some advanced features! But 8.1 is getting close to iOS and Android. Still has some advantages and unique design and features, and it is BUTTER SMOOTH. Integrates very nicely with MS services and some others. You have to try it to know what I'm talking about, but Microsoft is doing a good damn job with 8.1.I think a 30-40% fanboys will betray Apple and Samsung if they had this thing for a day. Throw an IR blaster, fingerprint scanner and everyone most of them will be sold, you don't even need some advanced options in apps or OS level. Keep it going Microsoft!Did I miss something?

B00H2BJ7WC,A2P6WKFYV8A3PC,"joe ""Joe""","[29, 30]","Nokia built an amazing phone with customized applications and Windows Phone 8 performs flawlessly. Super fast processor, smooth video; you can finally watch a video and listen to it with Bluetooth headphones (mine is Plantronics backbeat 903+).For those skeptical regarding applications, there is Instagram and Whatsapp for W8 (download is free for both) and many more free apps, although Lumia 1520 brings a load of essential applications.Very advisable to buy a cover, not only for its protection but for a better handling. I found the device extremely slippery in my hands. I purchased a cover with kick stand, so I can eat and read or watch a video.W8 automatically backs up most your data (pics, docs and videos) to skydrive, which is very convenient. All contacts I had on my HTC HD7 (Windows phone 7.5) was imported as soon as I register my accounts (Hotmail, Facebook and Google) even without the sim card. A great feature is that you can access your Lumia 1520 from your PC as if it is an external hard drive. You can also receive and send several kinds of files via Bluetooth. The NFC (Near Field Communication)  is amazing!!I still donnot understand people who rather pay a lot more for an IPhone or Android!!I also purchased a 32Gb micro SD (you can install up to 64Gb), which is another feature Iphones don't have.Also amazing is the battery. You will now have a phone that will keep up with you all day, provided you make a normal use of it. Remember to charge it, use it until battery runs out and charge it again, so that your battery will be optimized.Only disappointment regards to the charger which is European. Although seller sends (at no cost) an American adapter, it gets to be a very clumsy piece (both together).Well done Microsoft and Nokia.February 6th UpdateToday I test the Here Nokia (the built in GPS) I turned it on together with my car's GPS, except that I made it work offline. Both GPSs took me from where I was to where I wanted to go flawlessly. The Here Nokia offers more detailed information and precision. I am being amazed day after day by its software.",5.0,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",Nokia Lumia 1520 Black Factory Unlocked RM-937 4G/LTE 800/900/1800/2100/2600 International version no warranty,469.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kEMMuuQsL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 5738},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"

Excellent job by Nokia & Microsoft with their first phabletPros- Zero lag on Windows unlike andriod .Like the fluid nature of windows 8.- Amazing screen and camera , very nice choice of Nokia Cam apps . Just blows Note out of the water .Full 1080 display- Great hardware specs- Very solid premium feel to the phone , you might want to get a cover though .- Best part is its SD slot accessCons ( more on OS side)- windows need to refine their keyboard , something like Blackberry Z10 did .- waiting for HUB , hopefully 8.1 will have it . Lumia 1520 came installed with Lumia Black Update .I am still yet to figure out why it shows 4G/3G instead on Edge on T-Mobile though .",5.0,1391385600,"02 3, 2014",Nokia Lumia 1520 Black Factory Unlocked RM-937 4G/LTE 800/900/1800/2100/2600 International version no warranty,469.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kEMMuuQsL._SY300_.jpg,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 5738},Nokia,"[['Cell Phones & Accessories', 'Cell Phones', 'Unlocked Cell Phones']]"
